2120880,25,8,86,"Financial Resolutions, 1984. - Financial Resolution No. 11: General (Resumed).",07/02/1984,Mr. Michael Barrett,Fianna Fáil,Dublin North-West,"(Dublin North-West): The budget has been described as a non-event not alone by this side of the House but in some sections of the media. Listening to the contributions from the Government benches, one would imagine that there has been a big reduction in unemployment, but the January figures indicate that unemployment has increased by 7,000. The Minister for the Environment told us about a major achievement last year, with a substantial reduction in inflation, a massive improvement in the balance of payments and a significant increase in industrial output. He said that there has been a slowing down in the growth in unemployment. Of course he was not aware at that time of the increase in the figure. He told us that the budget strategy will ensure a continuation of this. One does not know whether he means a growth in unemployment or an upturn in employment. He said the budget would create a climate for job creation. The building trade has never been so bad. Thousands of men have been laid off since the Government took office and the remainder are on a three-day week or a week on and a week off. People who have worked all their lives in the building trade say it has never been in such a depressed state. There does not seem to be any plan in the budget to encourage people to be set up in business. Some Government Departments should take responsibility to improve the food industry. Fewer food items bearing the Irish brand can be seen in shops here today than those processed in Britain and continental countries. I do not think the Government have seen the need to develop small industries because they have done nothing in this respect in the past year. They say it is impossible to attract foreign industry at a time when we should be encouraging new industries, and our own people particularly. It is unfortunate that if our people set up businesses they will be crippled with taxation [1898] and the high rate of VAT. They will simply become tax collectors. Since the Government took office the Revenue Commissioners have been behaving like vultures. They are snooping into people's businesses. The same can be said about social welfare inspectors who are moving into businesses, particularly in regard to the small farmers. Their actions could be described as an infringement of privacy. Senator Higgins of Fine Gael recently expressed his concern about this in a statement to the media. I would remind him that this has been happening since the present Government took office. We on this side of the House did not object to the introduction of the youth levy because we thought the Government were sincere, that the levy would be used to increase youth employment. However, £11½ million from the fund has been transferred to balance the Government's books, all of it deducted from the pay packets of those who work, and contributed by employers, for the sole purpose of creating youth employment. The Taoiseach said on one occasion that the creation of jobs was a priority of the Government but he also said that their priority was to reduce our debt, and that unemployment would have to wait. Many people are concerned about crime and vandalism, particularly in our cities. The high incidence of crime and unemployment are interlinked. Young people who are unemployed become depressed. Since the Government took office they see no hope for the future. The Government put an embargo on recruitment in the public service and as a result vacancies are not being filled. Even recruitment to the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána has been stopped. I hope this will not give rise to a situation we had under a former Coalition Government of one-man squad cars. At that time there were many squad cars and motor cycles parked outside Garda stations with nobody to use them. When Fianna Fáil came back to office they changed all that. They had a massive Garda recruitment campaign. There was an increase in the number of gardaí on [1899] the street and squad cars were manned by two gardaí. I was born in the west and I am very disappointed that the Government did not allocate the required £3½ million to complete Knock Airport. Many people, particularly business people, looked forward to the opening of this airport. One of our biggest meat exporters is located in the west. He was particularly disappointed at the Government's decision. Monsignor Horan has done great work since he was appointed to Knock. He turned Knock into an international shrine and he was responsible for bringing the Pope to this country. The Government have shown no appreciation for all the work he has done. He uplifted the west. If the airport was completed thousands of people would come and it would be a great boost for tourism. People who wished to see Knock would have been able to travel directly to it. It seems as if the Government are not concerned about the people in the west. As regards social welfare payments, when a husband deserts a wife and she can prove that she does not know where he is she is entitled to deserted wife's benefit. That is not the case where a wife's deserts a husband. In this case the husband is penalised since he is taxed as a single man. In my constituency there is a case where a wife deserted a husband and left him with seven young children. He is responsible for rearing and educating the children. He is taxed as a single man. I hope the Minister will look into this matter because it is a serious problem. In the past we heard a lot about discrimination against women but this is a case of discrimination against a man simply because he is a man. I hope the Minister will do something about this. Our industrial and business outlets are unable to compete with those in Northern Ireland, England and other European countries. Deputy McGahon, in a statement to the press recently, expressed his concern about the number of coaches going through his constituency on their way to the North. I share his concern. According to reports, people from the South spend £2½ million per week in the [1900] North. The Deputy should have thought about that before walking into the Government lobbies and voting for this budget, which will increase the number of people travelling to the North. The 8 per cent VAT on clothing will ensure that more people will travel to the North. The increase in the number of clothing industries which were forced to close here in the last year is quite evident. This number will increase now that people will have to pay 8 per cent VAT on clothes. We hear great talk from the Government side about the increase in social welfare payments. The 7 per cent increase becomes effective from 1 July while increases in income tax are effective overnight. It has been suggested by Government speakers that there is only limited scope in the present economic climate for tax concessions. The cutbacks in social welfare and in medical cards is a regular occurrence. I recall the outburst by the Minister for Health when the then Minister, Deputy Woods, announced a reduction in the number of items available on the medical card. He made this reduction because he was aware of abuses. The present Minister described his action as outrageous. He said it was a war against the poor and the working class and that when his party came to power they would restore medical cards to old people. The decision by the Eastern Health Board to transfer one of the dentists who operates in Ballymun is of great concern to the local people. This matter was raised during the week. I know the Deputy who raised it was ruled out of order. I hope I am in order in bringing the matter to the attention of the Minister now. As a result of this decision there is only one dentist to look after the whole area of Ballymun which has a population equivalent to that of three counties. Although there are two dentists there, there is a long waiting list for treatment and the decision of the Minister and of the Eastern Health Board will increase out of all proportion the number of people on the waiting list. I am appealing to the Minister to have this matter examined with a view to the permanent [1901] appointment of a replacement dentist to serve the people of Ballymun. People who have inquired from the Eastern Health Board about the situation have been informed that because of Government cutbacks only one dentist will be available for the Ballymun area but that there will be another dentist operating on an on-off basis. That is not an acceptable situation. While Fianna Fáil were in power and while Deputy Woods was Minister for Health every person reaching the age of 65 had automatic entitlement to a medical card and the same situation applied to students, but now, despite the high costs involved for parents in sending their children to second and third level education, medical cards are to be withdrawn from students. It is true that the facility was not used extensively by young people but the explanation from the Government side is rather strange. Some people opposite have said that parents who can afford to send their children to second or third level education must be rich and, consequently, in a position to pay for medical services for their children. That is a peculiar explanation from a Government who are supposed to be a caring Government and who promised to look after the less well off. Apart from the loss of the medical card facility, most students now have to pay the full cost of school transport. One must compare this situation with the record of Fianna Fáil in the field of education. Fianna Fáil in Government introduced free education. Since the coming into office of this Government there has been an increase, too, in the fees in respect of the leaving certificate examination. It is obvious from the budget speech that the Government have no financial or economic targets. We must all be seriously concerned with what happened on the Stock Exchange last week. That financial crisis was an indication of a serious lack of confidence in the Government. It is for the Minister to ascertain the areas in which there are tax loopholes but he must decide where lie the best interests of the Exchequer. At all times the Irish money market must be strengthened [1902] and developed and be seen as a basis of trust and confidence. The Minister for Finance tells us repeatedly that our level of foreign borrowing is too high and that the Government are trying to reduce the budget deficit at the rate at which they are committed to reducing it. Continually, they blame Fianna Fáil for the whole problem in relation to borrowing and several members of the Government have stated that our party in Government were responsible for creating the high deficits. Because of these accusations I was pleased that our leader, Deputy Haughey, was able to come here and give facts and figures to clarify the situation. He was able to tell us, for instance, that between 1974 and 1976 the debt rose by between 80 and 90 per cent. These were years in which another Coalition were in power. They were years during which budget debts and borrowing soared. The high rates of VAT and excise duties are a matter of great concern especially in the business and industrial world. Such a situation provides no encouragement to employers to give employment. The television and radio business is collapsing. Many outlets in that trade are being forced to close as a result of the high VAT rates and high excise duty. On a recent television programme we heard that the excise duty on a television set here is £120 and that in addition VAT at 23 per cent must be charged on the total. This puts the price of an ordinary television set up to double the price at which it can be purchased in the North. A similar situation prevails in the motor trade. The number of people involved in that trade has reduced drastically in the past year. In Great Britain and in Northern Ireland there are two rates of VAT whereas there are at least four in this country. Our high rates of VAT are destroying any incentive there might be for people to stay in business. The increase in the price of petrol will mean an increase also in the cost of living generally. Many of my constituents tell me they find since the budget that foodstuffs are increasing daily. Obviously, the increased cost of delivering goods consequent [1903] on the increased petrol prices is in turn being passed on to the customer. The number of closures in the business world has had a big impact on employment. The Minister should have had regard to this and should have to some extent reduced the VAT rates and the excise duty. He should now review the situation. When Fianna Fáil were in Government they set up a warning system that was designed to give an indication of firms who were experiencing difficulty. I do not know whether that system is being operated. In the past year or so some long-established firms have gone to the wall. In Cork alone the situation has been very bad with the closure of Fords and of Dunlops. There has been the closure also of the Scarriff chipboard factory, of Clondalkin Paper Mills and of Ranks Flour Mills. Exceptional efforts should have been made by the Government to prevent these industries from closing. We now have a situation in which all our paper, chipboard and flour requirements are imported. I am reliably informed that the reason Ranks decided to close here was that they could import flour £20 per tonne cheaper and they were not prepared to remain open. The proprietors and management of industry have a duty to employees and to the community to make every effort to keep industry going. The Government share that responsibility. When Fine Gael and Labour came into Government unemployment was around 170,000 and in their joint programme they promised to deal with the problem. In a statement issued at that time the Taoiseach said unemployment was the first priority for the Government. We have heard about the task force to deal with unemployment but we wonder what it is doing. Since this Government took office the unemployment figure has increased by 45,000. The Government are concerned only with a bookkeeping exercise and this was obvious in the case of £11,500,000 that was supposed to create jobs for young people. Instead, it was transferred to the Government to help them to balance the books. The Coalition parties must be [1904] aware of their unpopularity with the public even though the recent poll might have indicated to them that they were making progress. I have no confidence in these polls. The real indicator was the result of the Dublin Central by-election. This was an area in which the Labour Party held a seat for many years but in that election they were in fifth place behind the Communist Party. That must be a matter of grave concern to the Labour Party members in Government. It was an indication of what the people thought of the Labour Party and of their performance in Government. I have no doubt that the result of that by-election was the real reason for the postponement of the local elections. The general opinion is that this budget was an non-event. It reminded me of a magician who comes out on stage empty-handed, after a few minutes on stage he produces various items such as coloured handkerchiefs, pigeons and rabbits but at the end of the show all these things disappear and the magician walks away empty-handed, the same as when he came on stage. That is the way I would describe this budget.",07/02/1984,24,1498,1499,dentist operating on an on-off basis That is not an acceptable situation While Fianna Fáil were in power and while,Deputy Woods,was Minister for Health every person reaching the age of 65 had automatic entitlement to a medical card and the,Deputy Woods,2120880_6,,dentist operating on an on-off basis That is not an acceptable situation While Fianna Fáil were in power and while Deputy Woods was Minister for Health every person reaching the age of 65 had automatic entitlement to a medical card and the,dentist operating on an on-off basis That is not an acceptable situation While Fianna Fáil were in power and while was Minister for Health every person reaching the age of 65 had automatic entitlement to a medical card and the,text954,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.078086881,-0.001952172,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.243243243,0.254254254,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0
750701,292,14,127,"Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, 1950—Second Stage (Resumed).",11/04/1951,Mr. William Davin,The Labour Party,Leix-Offaly,"I want to know, from Deputy Lemass in particular, and from Deputy Dr. Ryan, what authority they have from the workers or any section of the people for suggesting that the total cost of this scheme should be raised by way of direct taxation upon all sections of our citizens. Have they received even one resolution from any organised body of workers demanding that the full cost of this scheme should be provided by direct taxation? The labour and trade union movement that have been demanding the provision of a social security scheme over a long period of years, after careful consideration, having reviewed the question— as far as I know the last occasion on which they did so was in August, 1947 —have always demanded a social security scheme that would be based on a compulsory contributory system. I assert that Deputy Lemass would not advocate that scheme and plead [558] that this whole matter should be taken out of the arena of Party politics were it not for the fact that he is making that appeal specially to the most selfish class of people who may be brought under cover of this scheme. At any rate, I do not recognise that he has any authority from the organised workers to advocate a scheme on that basis. I go further. Those who remember the discussion that took place on the Vote on Account will remember Deputy Lemass, Deputy Dr. Ryan and the leading members of the Fianna Fáil Party who sit in the Front Bench, crying about the huge increase in the Estimates and asserting that the people were unable to bear the burden of taxation that would have to be raised this year to meet the Estimates for the various public services. Now they come along, forgetting, conveniently, what they said in regard to these matters on the Vote on Account, asking that another £4,600,000 or more should be added to the bill to which they objected on the Vote on Account. Is that consistent with sincerity in discharging their duties to the public? I assert that it is the changing tactics of Fianna Fáil from one month to another, from one day to another, from one member on the Front Bench to another, that one fails to understand. That is why the leaders should be asked to come into the House before the division to clarify the position for the followers of Fianna Fáil, if for nobody else.

985699,241,9,94,"An Bille um an Tr&iacute &uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1958—an Dara C&eacute im. Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958—Second Stage.",26/11/1958,Mr. John Aloysius Costello,Fine Gael,Dublin Townships,"When the Irish people wanted to get an inter-Party Government they were sufficiently intelligent to know how to achieve that. They did that in 1954 and, when they wanted to give an overall majority again, they did so in 1957. They can do what they like within this system. They have got their education in this system over 36 years. Now because Fianna Fáil have been beaten twice under the system, they want to try, if they can, to ensure that they will never be beaten again and incidentally, the net result may be, though I do not say it will be— Deputies have to consider the possible results as well as the probable results —the end of political democracy as we know it in this country because the results of the operations of this particular electoral system advocated by the Government will almost [1018] certainly, in existing conditions, have the effect of doing away with all except a very small section of parliamentary opposition. Parliamentary democracy cannot work without an Opposition and not just an Opposition that is allowed to talk merely when the Government thinks right, but an Opposition that is effective, that can make its will known and make its voice heard throughout the country and that can stop corruption, injustice and inefficiency. Unless you have an Opposition capable of doing that job — and it is not capable of doing its job, unless it can form an alternative Government — then we will have nothing but arrogant Government tending to dictatorship. I am quite well aware that it is probably highly likely, even under the system proposed, that the electorate will be so disgusted with Fianna Fáil that there will be such an election as will root Fianna Fáil out of office. As I said on Sunday in Carlow, even though that may be to the political advantage of Fine Gael, and even though it may be that Fine Gael would get, sooner than people expect, an over-all majority as a Government, nevertheless we stand by our traditions and by the example of those who founded our Party. We wish that all minorities should get their proper representation in this Parliament because we are convinced that the true interests of the Irish people lie in such an arrangement. In the course of his early remarks, the Taoiseach referred to the fact that other countries that had adopted the system he proposed were more democratic than the rest of us. I suppose Great Britain claims to be the mother of Parliaments and the home of democracy. America certainly is a highly democratic State, but in Great Britain they have, in connection with this system, something that we have not got here. They have a long tradition of a political character behind them which enables them, in that tradition, to prevent the violent fluctuations and changes and the evil that can come from the adoption of this system. We have not got that tradition. The Founding Fathers, as they are called in America, with their most inspired foresight [1019] framed the constitution of the United States of America, which has withstood the test of time, and if I may add, the very severe test of democracy. They foresaw the dangers inherent in the full logical operation of democracy and they put their checks and balances in a most scientific and farsighted way into that constitution exactly to ease any revolutionary situation that might come about by the over-logical workings of democracy. We have not got that here in this country. We are moving, if this Bill is carried and approved by the people in a referendum, into an unknown and untried land. The people are told by the Taoiseach: 'I do not want a multiplicity of Parties here. I do not want a Farmers' Party I do not want a Labour Party and I do not want any Independents. I want two Parties. We are the big one and we are going to stay that way. Let you all go into one and form the second Party and then everything will be grand.' The Taoiseach talked about bargains. May I say in passing that so far as bargains are concerned in connection with the two inter-Party Governments with which I was associated, I assert most positively there was no such thing? I pass that up now and I pass on to this point. Whatever bargains could come out from the Taoiseach's heated imagination—and I think he is obsessed by the fact that P. R. has beaten him, 'him' being underlined, twice and that he is incapable of an impartial judgment— any bargains that could come from the fevered imagination of the Taoiseach are nothing compared with the bargains and pressure groups and possible corruption that will come from this new proposal. When we were in Government the Taoiseach said: 'You are not to combine at all. It is all wrong. It is quite vicious for the Labour Party and Fine Gael, the Farmers' Party and the Independents to join in a programme openly published and arrived at. That is wrong, although it is done before the public eye. It is all wrong when you do that as Parties and work in harmony for a while, but you are [1020] now to get together and form one Party, and as long as you are in the one Party, everything will be grand.' Is that not the most arrant nonsense? Of course, the real truth of the matter is that no such thing could happen and the probability is that if the system goes through, at least for a while, Fianna Fáil will be there with their organisation and the other Parties there with their traditions there will be one-member constituencies and three or four of them will go up for election and Fianna Fáil will slip in on a minority vote and then will be in here. God protect the ordinary people of the country if that happens because there will be a big Party and a small Party which cannot be in opposition because that Party, if they get in again, will see to it that they will put a stranglehold on the electorate. We remember an actual occurrence on one occasion when Fianna Fáil were at the height of their power and were what we call here in this motion an arrogant Government. In a certain election in a certain county, a number of workers downed their tools and marched in military file, headed by their foreman, and voted illiterately so that it would be plain that they voted for Fianna Fáil otherwise, their jobs would be gone. That is what we are in danger of having.",26/11/1958,16,63,64,do what they like within this system They have got their education in this system over 36 years Now because,Fianna Fáil,have been beaten twice under the system they want to try if they can to ensure that they will never,Fianna Fáil,985699_1,,do what they like within this system They have got their education in this system over 36 years Now because Fianna Fáil have been beaten twice under the system they want to try if they can to ensure that they will never,do what they like within this system They have got their education in this system over 36 years Now because have been beaten twice under the system they want to try if they can to ensure that they will never,text840,1,2,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.510825624,0.012770641,0.048038446,0.001200961,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.592592593,0.493493493,0.48048048,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,0
711212,894,9,93,Committee on Finance. - Motion by Minister for Finance.,21/03/1950,Mr. Michael Joseph O'Higgins,Fine Gael,Dublin South-West,"Deputy Childers devoted portion of his time in speaking on this Vote on Account, to endeavouring to convince Deputies that there was something sinister and disturbing in the various speeches made by Ministers of the present Government. He mentioned the Minister for External Affairs on the one hand and the Minister for Finance on the other. Any Deputy who has taken the trouble to sit in and listen to the speeches which have been made from the Fianna Fáil Benches on this Vote is certainly entitled to ask Fianna Fáil Deputies whether they have made up their minds yet as to what their approach to this Vote on [2147] Account is. Deputy Aiken went back with peevish recollection three or four times in the course of his speech to the fuss, as he said, that was kicked up about the Supplementary Budget. Obviously, he had not quite made up his mind as to how he should approach the Estimates for this year. He did, however, feel, and he did not hesitate to say it, that if it were necessary to raise this money, that it should be done directly by means of taxation rather than by means of loans or borrowing. Deputy Kissane was quite blunt about it. He said he thought the Estimate was excessive and he was opposed to it. Deputy Bartley, on the other hand, regretted the various reductions which were made as between this year's Estimates and last year's Estimates. Deputy Childers raised a number of points. With one or two of these I think I could agree but in the case of the majority of them, I feel that Deputy Childers was merely talking against time. As I mentioned earlier, he spoke of the differences which he saw between the views of the Minister for External Affairs and the views of other Ministers. I think the real difficulty of Deputy Childers and his colleagues is that they have never bothered to study the pronouncements made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance since this Government took office, slightly over two years ago. We remember, when we think back on the past two years, the vehement opposition which was encountered by the Minister for Finance when he spoke of eliminating waste and extravagance and when he spoke of retrenchment. The Minister for Finance made it quite clear from the very start that he was not standing for economies merely for the sake of economies or for retrenchment purely for the sake of retrenchment, that he was standing for eliminating waste and extravagance such as existed under the Fianna Fáil Government, saving money on a number of wasteful projects which they had initiated, and turning it into more useful channels, channels which would be more productive for the Irish people. In replying to the Budget debate in [2148] 1948, the present Minister for Finance once more drew the attention of Fianna Fáil Deputies to what his policy was in that direction. On the 25th of May on the Budget debate he pointed out that Deputy McCann had spoken of retrenchment as distinct from economies and he said: 'I want retrenchment on certain things. I am not aiming at retrenchment for retrenchment's sake. I want to retrench on certain unessentials, certain extravagances, certain wasteful ways of spending money, in order to have the moneys, which can be levied off the people of the State without doing too much harm, available for constructive work.' I think in that phrase the Minister for Finance summarised what his policy and the policy of this Government was so far as retrenchment was concerned. I do not think they have deviated from that at all. I think the approach of the Minister for Finance in the statement he made this evening and in the set-up of the present Estimates, merely goes to show that the Government are endeavouring to implement the policy which was laid down by them over two years ago. Deputy Childers said there is nothing very extraordinary about the separation of the capital items in the Estimates from other services, that anyone with a pencil and paper could have done that when the Estimates were produced any year. Possibly that is correct in so far as, if a person knew what were to be termed as capital items and if he searched through the Book of Estimates and took the trouble of segregating what in his opinion were capital items and deducted these items from the total shown in the front of the book in former years, he would have got, on the one hand, capital items and, on the other hand, what it was proposed to spend on other services. But, in fact, what the Minister did this year was, to separate the items beforehand. He asked the Dáil this afternoon to study the various matters he had set aside as being items of capital expenditure proper to be met by borrowing, items which, in his opinion, it would not be fair to levy off the present-day taxpayer, and he asked Deputies opposite to look into that list which is given in the front of the Book [2149] of Estimates and let him have their opinions as to whether or not those items were properly capital items or not. I do not think there is one Fianna Fáil Deputy who has accepted that invitation of the Minister. I did not hear any Fianna Fáil Deputy making any effort to criticise this sum of over £12,000,000 on the grounds that it was not proper capital expenditure. Deputy Aiken did say that if the money was to be raised it should be raised by means of direct taxation. I think the Deputy missed the whole point in the new set-up in the Book of Estimates entirely. He did not appear to appreciate what the Minister was doing or inviting him to do. Be that as it may, no Fianna Fáil Deputy, so far as I am aware, has endeavoured to make the case that, in the segregation of the items, those segregated for capital purposes are not properly in that list. I assume that they agree with the Minister that all of the items which go to make up something over £12,000,000 are properly items of capital expenditure. Consequently, the only point left then is as to whether or not it is good financial policy to ensure that these particular projects will be financed by means of borrowed money rather than by means of taxation levied against the taxpayers this year or next year. Deputy Seán Collins and most Deputies who spoke on this side expressed agreement with the Minister's point of view. So far as I am concerned, I feel that what the Minister is doing is the very essence of a sound financial policy. It does appear ridiculous to adopt the attitude adopted by Deputy Aiken, the man who was for a number of years Minister for Finance, to hold that if certain projects are to be initiated, even if the Minister for Finance of the day has the certain knowledge that the taxpayers will not reap any advantage, good, bad or indifferent, from those schemes—it does seem to be ridiculous in those circumstances that it should be suggested that these schemes should be financed by the taxpayers of to-day and financed by them alone. The Minister has suggested that it is only right that when posterity will reap [2150] a large share of the benefit from schemes now being initiated, posterity should also bear a fair share of the cost. It seems to me that Deputies opposite are rather disappointed that the Minister has adopted that particular attitude, not because they do not believe it is the right attitude to adopt, not because they do not believe it is sound financial policy, but because they would like to see the Minister crippling the people with taxation, as his predecessors did. They have learned their lesson, belatedly though it be, of the Supplementary Budget. Perhaps it is due in no small way to that Supplementary Budget that the Deputies find themselves on the far side of the House. They had hopes the present Minister for Finance might do exactly the same thing. I think the speech of Deputy Aiken to-day demonstrated that that was very present to his mind and the whine we heard was in the main a whine of disappointment—disappointment that the present Minister was not going to make the same mistake as the Deputy made when he was Minister for Finance. This much can be said for Deputy Aiken's contribution to this debate. He at least put his feet down on one side of the fence. He said he believed all this money should be levied off the taxpayers to-day and none should be raised by borrowing. We heard Deputy Childers's disclaimer that he was in any way representative of the Fianna Fáil Party, and his statement that he was only giving his own personal view in a number of the things he said. I think we may take it that Deputy Aiken, the last Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, was in fact representing the financial policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and I think we can take it, when Deputy Aiken says to the Minister: 'You should not raise this money by borrowing you should raise it by taxation it should be brought into your Budget statement and taxation should be increased under your coming Budget in order to raise that money,' that that is the Fianna Fáil viewpoint, the Fianna Fáil policy. Let us examine that for a moment. I do not think I can be contradicted [2151] on that assumption. I take it that Deputies opposite still follow the Aiken lead in finance. Let us consider the Fianna Fáil view point on this. There is a sum of £12,000,000 which the Minister proposes to raise by borrowing, because the benefit in a large measure will accrue to future generations. Fianna Fáil say that that is not right they say: 'If we were back there where you are, we would raise every penny of that £12,000,000 in the coming Budget and we would tax the people. We would tax their beer, their cigarettes, their tobacco and their cinemas in order to raise that £12,000,000.' Is that not the Fianna Fáil policy in an nutshell?",21/03/1950,13,1521,1522,view in a number of the things he said I think we may take it that Deputy Aiken the last,Fianna Fáil,Minister for Finance was in fact representing the financial policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and I think we can,Fianna Fáil,711212_22,,view in a number of the things he said I think we may take it that Deputy Aiken the last Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance was in fact representing the financial policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and I think we can,view in a number of the things he said I think we may take it that Deputy Aiken the last Minister for Finance was in fact representing the financial policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and I think we can,text167,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.323323323,0.323323323,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

1430717,870,9,92,Membership of EEC: Motion (Resumed).,02/07/1970,Mr. John O'Donovan,Fine Gael,Dublin South-East,"I am replying to what the Minister said. However, I shall relate it quite specifically. If we go into the Common Market we shall not merely have English companies like the ones I mentioned, Unilever, Marks and Spencer, Liptons and so on, coming in here and taking over our retail trade and pushing the small man out of business, but we shall have whatever the corresponding companies are in Europe, ones that correspond perhaps with the Atlantic and Pacific and Piggly-Wiggly stores in America. Less and less of our retail trade will be in the hands of small retailers. In other words, everybody in this country will become employees and there will be less indepedence of view among our people. The Minister spoke about the number of reports we have had and Deputy Garrett FitzGerald spoke at some length about the fact that nobody made the case against going into the Common Market. Let me be quite candid and honest about this. I had no intention of setting myself up, with my limited resources, to fight the resources of the State in this matter. There was such euphoria in 1961/62 about going into the Comon Market that I would have been regarded as a head case. I have so far been replying to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but perhaps I had better get some order into my speech. [359] Let me deal with the history of this matter, and I shall not go back to medieval Europe, as one speaker did, or talk about the divine right of kings, as another speaker did. I shall talk about the non-reference to 1961/62 during the course of this debate. The debate has been going on now for several days and you would imagine there had been some sort of revolution in Western Europe since 1961/62. Personally, I see no change whatever. It is up to the people who say there has been a complete change to prove it. Do not forget that the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1953 and was pretty well in operation in 1961. You would imagine the year 1961 was at least a century away for all the reference that has been made to it. Britain did not go into the Common Market in 1961-62. Mr. Heath was in Brussels continuously for the best part of a year, and in fact he was honoured for the manner in which he worked at that time. Eventually in February, 1962, General de Gaulle sent M. Couve de Murville out there with instructions to put an end to this chatter. They had not agreed to the terms for agriculture and so there were six months of chatter, and this was more or less the word that M. Couve de Murville used. The British papers blamed the long-nosed Frenchman. We all remember the cartoons of him with his nose out a foot and being blamed for keeping them out of the Common Market. Britain could have gone into the Common Market in 1953. They would have been welcomed by the other European countries. The fact is that when the big European countries, Italy, France and Germany, were turned down flat by Britain in 1953, they were not going to make things easy for the British in 1961. Since these countries did not make things easy for the British in 1961 the British will not make it easy for them now. I have always forecast that Britain will not go into Europe until she is defeated in war. There is a great deal of claptrap talked about the weakness of Britain. She is, of course, weak compared to the super states, America and Russia, but she is [360] still a proud and powerful nation, and she is not going into Europe crawling on her belly. The Minister referred to what was a common belief at that time. In 1961-62 all the euphoria here about going into Europe had one good effect but it is not going to have that effect this time. It had the effect that many of our firms started to improve their methods, to instal new machinery and so on. At that time no other case was being made and indeed no other case would be listened to. Although I did not believe that we were going in, I said at the time that this was one good effect which the whole campaign had. It was an excellent effect for it succeeded in getting many of our firms to improve their methods. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said he had heard the arguments that it had evaporated a bit, but I think it evaporated very decidely. He went on to prove by figures, by saying that there had been 1,453 grants, that this was not so at all. The proof is that gradually our industry is becoming better and better equipped and despite what was said that movement began in the early fifties. The difficulty industry had was that it put too much money into real capital in the fifties and so many of them were left without adequate working capital. Deputy FitzGerald referred to the CIO report which referred to the redundancy of 11,000 workers and went on to say that of course half of these would retire anyway. Since we are talking about jobs and job security, it does not matter whether people retire or not, there are that many fewer in employment. If 5,500 out of the 11,000 were going to retire anyway, obviously they were not going to be replaced. That of course is an extremely serious matter. I now come to what has been a main subject for discussion. Deputy Corish mentioned the Word 'fear' and he was jeered at for doing so. Have Deputies never heard of that pearl: 'Fear is the beginning of wisdom'? I do not know why there has been so much chatter about Deputy Corish's use of the word 'fear'. It is a much more suitable word to use in this connection than the word 'challenge'. I heard a new phrase from the Minister [361] for Industry and Commerce this morning, although I do not mind admitting that I had probably seen it already in some magazine. I still do not think that the phrase was worth much. The phrase was 'product policy'. I suppose a different coloured package or something like that is a piece of product policy. This is the kind of thing we are discussing when we talk about these items. They have little or nothing to do with the realities of the problem. Nobody in this House has a more unalterable opposition to our going into Europe than I have and I will given the most serious reasons for that. Bi-lateral trade agreements are usually agreements made for a year or two, and it should not be forgotten that the day of reckoning comes at the end of that time, but in spite of that, look at the way these countries have behaved. I will give some examples. Of course, the Department should keep their mouths shut about these examples. They must have them in hundreds by now. At least the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, was honest when he said that the Germans had ratted on a piece of the last bi-lateral trade agreement. When I asked him here if this was the first time the Germans had ratted he replied straight out that it was not. I can say what the first occasion was. The first time the Germans ratted on a bi-lateral trade agreement was when the Fianna Fáil Party were stuck in the British over a stupid dispute. We had a bi-lateral trade agreement with Germany on a three-to-one basis, that we would buy three times as much from Germany as they would buy from us. It was one of the finest ideas Mr. Lemass ever had. He wanted to set up the oil refinery on the north side of the Liffey and for that oil refinery four tankers were built in Germany. They cost £3 million in the late thirties, the equivalent to £15 million today. What did the Germans say when we claimed that that should be taken into account? 'They were ordered from London.' The so-and-sos would not allow it to be taken into account in the agreement although it was a bi-lateral trade agreement that was going to end in a year or [362] two. Despite the possibility of a sanction that they would not forget they still would not agree and they turned down the claim of the Government. Why? Because we were stuck we were at war—the economic war it was called, although it was much more a political war than an economic war except that certain people were put in as soldiers who were not soldiers at all. Although I know nothing about what has happened in the last 15 years in this context I could still give numerous examples and I could also give examples of the way in which to deal with this matter. I can give an example in relation to the French. On the whole, when the French are not in balance of payments difficulties they behave quite reasonably, but some years ago they had an agreement with us to take some Easter lamb from us. They had a similar agreement with the Dutch. The week before Easter they pulled down the iron shutter on lamb going into France. We, advised by these gentlemen in the Department of External Affairs, who were so gentlemanly that they had not got the guts of a rabbit, did nothing about it. The Dutch, on the other hand said: 'Right boys, no French wines into Holland' and the Dutch sold their lambs to the French and we did not. That is what happens unless you are prepared to fight. Let me give one other example of the kind of nonsensical rubbish believed by the people in this country who are in favour of going into the Common Market. The fact is that France could feed the whole of western Europe. Some years ago France had 10,000 old cows which they wanted to sell to the Germans. It took six months' argument to get West Germany, with a population of 80 million people, to take 10,000 cows. We produce 10,000 old cows a fortnight. Can anybody deny that? For what would represent one fortnights' production in this country the French had to argue with the Germans for six months before they would take them. The bilateral trade agreements are a much better base than a general treaty on which to argue with these countries. The case was made at great length about the work done by the [363] first Government here to change the nature of the British Empire. I was a student at that time and I certainly admired the work done. I remember praising the Statute of Westminster and the equality of status without necessarily equality of function. I felt the British would continue, as the biggest country with their Commonwealth, to do most of the work. Any sensible person would admire the work of the late Deputy O'Higgins and, in particular, the work done by Deputy McGilligan, who was the main architect of the Statute of Westminster. Despite that, it was not that that made this country a nation. Our neutrality in the Second World War was what made this country a nation. We arrived at the Second World War as nothing. We had been destroyed by the economic dispute with England. Our economy was destroyed. We came out of that war, although conditions were very tough and far tougher than we pretended to ourselves, with the respect of the whole western world for having remained out of it and for the way we behaved when out. That was when we became a nation. The suggestion has been made that we will cut ourselves off from Europe if we do not go into the Common Market. I would suggest that the system which has grown up of many continental children and students coming here to learn English and of our children going to these western European countries will make us Europeans to the extent that we are not already Europeans. Our whole tradition, especially in education, is the European tradition. There is no use in pretending that whether we go into the EEC or remain out of it we are not in the mainstream of European tradition. Although we are a small country we are steeped in that tradition. It is nonsense to say that we can do certain things by going into the Common Market which cannot be done by remaining outside it. At one stage I used to get irritated with this and I concocted a phrase of which I am proud. I said that whenever I think of the Common Market I think of the common mind, and in the second part [364] of that phrase I am using the word 'common' as it is used in Munster. I must refer to the hope expressed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, that the Irish language would do better if we went into Europe than if we remained outside. There is some point in that. We suffer from the impact of the English language on one side of us and the impact of it on the Atlantic side also. I know enough Irish to be able to ask the Minister whether he was going to put this Ireland physically into the middle of Europe. Otherwise, we must remain between two vast English-speaking populations. This is where we are going to remain. Reference was made to a recent pamphlet published by Mr. Coughlan. I notice a most deplorable remark was made about it in the course of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's speech. At column 1955, Volume 247, of the Official Report, the Deputy said: So much for the Coughlan pamphlet producing the arguments for staying out. They are as thin as the pamphlet itself. I will make a comment on that. That remark was as thick as Deputy Dr. FitzGerald himself. That is a fair comment, referring to the 'thick' and 'thin'. Mr. Coughlan and his associates have the resources of the Government behind them. I would like to put down a Parliamentary Question to find out the cost of producing these documents. I would probably be told they were produced as part of the duties of their writers by numbers of civil servants and that their cost could not easily be calculated. Each of these pamphlets, 'Membership of the European Communities and its Implications for Irish Industry' and 'Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC' cost thousands of pounds to prepare. I wrote some articles about the matter in 1961-62. One was written because a kindly journalist was at a meeting where I was asked to present the Irish Times trophy for debate. The journalist went back to the editor of the Irish Independent and the editor in a phone call said he believed that I had [365] said that there was a conspiracy of silence about our going into the Common Market. I had said that and I meant it and I was asked to write an article which would be printed. The Irish Independent printed the article. It was written in the strongest way. I commend the paper for having printed it. They even announced in the front page that the article was to be found in the paper.

989731,301,22,27,"An Bille um an Tr&iacute &uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1958—An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958—Second Stage (Resumed).",16/12/1958,Mr. Eamon de Valera,Sinn Féin,Clare East,"I had hoped that this Bill would be argued on its merits and that we would hear arguments from the Opposition, trying to show that multiple member constituencies with voting on the transferable vote system are superior in the national interest, to single member constituencies, with the non-transferable vote. Here and there in the speeches, an attempt was made to get down to bedrock and to argue on the merits, but if you take the Opposition speeches as a whole, they have been simply suggestions of bad faith or desires of various kinds on our part. The people can judge for themselves. They can ask themselves which is the preferable system in the interests of the country. It is not as if we, by our majority here, were putting through a measure without an opportunity being given to the people to express their views on it. This measure, when it is passed through the Oireachtas, as I hope it will, will have to go before the people, and each elector will have the opportunity of saying 'yes' or 'no'. Surely it is the essence of democracy that the individual voter in the community should have an opportunity of saying whether he wants this or whether he does not want it? The pretence that this is put forward for various reasons, of course, is like the pretences we had whenever we introduced anything in the public interest. The Constitution was attacked all over the country. The attack was led by the present Leader of the Opposition, who then also used his powers of advocacy to try to divert the attention of people from the issues that were fundamentally at [2336] stake. He did not discuss whether the Constitution was a good Constitution in itself or whether a Constitution drawn up by the Irish people's representatives, which gave full freedom, was superior to a Constitution which admittedly had been imposed upon us in some of its major sections. That was the real issue for the people, but that was not the issue that was put by the Deputies on the opposite side, who tried the very self-same trick as they are trying now, that is, suggesting all sorts of things. The people were told that I at that time tried to put the Constitution through in order that I might become a dictator. The Constitution would rob women of the right to work outside the home, according to Deputy Costello. My sight was better then than it is now, and I could almost see him with his tongue in his cheek as he led the women on to the attack on the Constitution, suggesting that the Constitution would deprive them of work, put them back in the kitchen and would deprive every woman working in trade, factory or industry of her security. The very waitresses here in Leinster House were led to believe that they would be immediately dismissed, if the Constitution went through. These were the ways in which the issues were put to the people when vital issues of tremendous importance to the people of this State were being put before them for decision. The same sort of thing is happening now and will happen when the campaign opens. You will have people on the other side trying to suggest that this will mean instability. One would imagine that if this went through, the ordinary voter could not vote as before and that anybody who wanted to go up as a candidate could not go up as before. The suggestion is that you cannot do these things. Of course, you can. There is no interference whatever with the voter. There is no interference with anybody going forward as a candidate who wants to go forward. The system being suggested is the very self-same system as is in operation where democracy has been stable. It is the system which is in operation in countries that we know of, such as [2337] the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand and so on. These are countries about which we know — of which we have some knowledge. We know their circumstances in general terms. What is suggested is that the same system be used here. The reason is that that system does lead to stability and unity in political matters, as against the other system which leads to division. Let us take the first point. We have either single member constituencies or multiple-member constituencies. Which is the better? I heard Deputy Sweetman talk about a single member constituency as if it were an evil. In a single member constituency — it is a smaller constituency — the people will know those for whom they are voting, in the main, because, in the main, the people put forward will be known to the electorate, and the electors will be able to judge of the character of the candidate and of his likely ability as a public representative. The suggestion that they will be tied solely to local affairs is nonsense. They will undoubtedly know what the local conditions are. They will know what the local problems are. May I ask Deputies who are engaged in a loud conversation to be good enough to cease talking? Taking a single member constituency, the individual candidates are put forward. Independents can be put forward members of one Party or any other Party can be put forward and if they have a majority in the area, they can be elected. It is suggested that people who come from local areas will not have any national interest. Why should that be? They are coming to a national assembly. If you take it area by area, you will be able to get as much national material in it as you will get in any other way. The people who would come up here to the national Parliament to decide national questions will know intimately how proposed legislation will affect their particular area and the interests in that area. Surely the whole purpose of representative assemblies is that the individual in these assemblies should be aware of how general legislation will affect his own particular section of the country. [2338] I say that with the single member constituency, they will be able to do that better than the people in a multiple-member constituency, because they will know it better. It will be an area which they can travel over and therefore, from the point of view of service to the nation, of public representation, it seems to me that a small area, an area of reasonable size —and the area will be the size indicated by the number of population —in general, would give a better Assembly here. I would say also, that we would get a better type of candidate with the small unit than the large. Notwithstanding the opinion held by Deputy Sweetman, who holds a contrary view, I believe we will. There is no reason why we should not get at least as good and maybe a better, candidate because he will know exactly what the problems are. He will be able to attend to his business with less expenditure of time and energy than if he had a large area to move over. There are a number of disadvantages in the multiple—member constituency system: its size and the fact that the voters will not know the candidates who are put up from one end of the constituency to the other. They will not know the people so well, and they will not be able to judge so well of the individual who is put up. Then there are the rivalries of various kinds that occur in multiple-member constituencies. They will not be there any longer. The rivalries that occur are very disedifying and tend to bring democratic representation into disrepute. I feel, therefore, that as between the multiple—member constituency and the single member constituency, if any person has simply to vote on that issue alone, he would vote for the single-member constituency and the smaller area. The next thing is the question of P. R. It has been suggested—of course another one of these things, like the women being affected by the Constitution—that this is aimed at and will have the effect of disfranchising minorities. Suppose the reference was to the Protestant section of the people, the 7 per cent., let us say, of the population. It is quite obvious [2339] that, if they are fairly well distributed throughout the country, you would need a constituency of 13 or 14 members to ensure that, on their own vote alone, one of the minority would be elected. Nobody will suggest that you should have a constituency of 13 or 14 members. Think of the size of the voting paper. How many voters would you get in a constituency of that kind who would vote 1, 2, 3, down to the end of the list of candidates? We know perfectly well it would not be done, and we know, as a matter of fact, it is not done even at the present time, although the constituencies are smaller because after 1, 2, 3, the voter who votes very quickly, very frequently does not go any further. I have had presented to me on a couple of occasions a very large ballot paper on which there were a large number of candidates. Although I had a fair idea of the people who were going up, I very soon came to the conclusion that I could not judge as between A and B in a long list of that size and so, then, to a large extent this idea of P. R. is illusory. It is illusory, certainly, so far as the Protestant minority are concerned. Those Protestants who get elected, get elected either because they are in a particular area where they have a definite majority, or, if that is not so, they get elected because they are accepted as members of a political Party. If they were not accepted as members of a political Party, they would not have been elected at all, because their own votes would not have been sufficient to elect them. It is ridiculous, then, to suggest that this is a measure which will prevent the Protestant minority from getting a fair share of representation in the Dáil. In the case of the single member constituency, the result is that the candidates do their utmost to try to get votes from the various sections. Therefore, they tend, so far as possible, towards moderation. They try to get a policy which will win support from those sections. It was suggested also that this [2340] measure would drive people, who are not accepting the rule of law at the moment, farther away. No one is prevented from going up in these elections. Anybody who wants to go up in these elections — I mean the elections that will ensure after this is through — can go up as before. If such a candidate can secure a majority, he will be elected— if his policy is a policy accepted by the people. If the Irish people want to accept the policy, or want to take over the policy, that has been suggested by those who say we should make war — because that is what it amounts to — these people can go and look for support for that policy and if they get it, if they get a majority, they can carry out that policy, if they want to. On the suggestion that this State would not be as democratic if you had the single member constituency and the non-transferable vote, which I contest, remember that this, when it has been passed — and not otherwise — will be part of the Constitution enacted by the people — the fundamental law which every citizen is bound to respect and obey and should, where necessary, be made to obey, because if we have not the rule of law then we will have anarchy. You cannot have it both ways. You have either to accept the system and say that there is government of the people by the people as a whole, and not government by a group that arrogates authority to itself, or not. They are quite free. There is an open field for anybody who wants to go up and to put any policy before the people. The object of elections is threefold. The first is to get a legislative assembly. If that were the only thing done in an election, then we could let the P. R. system, as it is at the moment, stand without too much worry. But the elections are for more than that. The elections are to get a government, and the elections are to decide on the national policy. I say that these two objects were defeated by the system that we have at the moment, or can be defeated. Even those who are in favour of the transferable vote and P. R. admit that it leads to a multiplicity of Parties. Nobody has denied that. [2341] When Deputy Costello was opposing the Constitution, and opposing this method of the single transferable vote and P. R. in that way, he admitted that it led to a multiplicity of Parties. My difference with him at that time was that we had this system working: it had been working for a certain time. I felt he wanted to leave it free to P. R. of any kind and that, of course, would have left it wide open to all the manoeuvring which Deputy Costello is so fond of attributing, in intention, to us. I wanted to have it fixed in the Constitution, because the method of election is the basis upon which the whole of our political institutions, legislature, political life, and so on, are based. If you are to have any Constitution, it surely should cover the method of election. At that time, P. R., so far, had not worked out too badly for the country. We wanted to have definitely in the Constitution what form it should take, and we put it in the Constitution, therefore, at the time, as it is at the moment, that is, the transferable vote and the multiple-member constituency. Deputy Costello wanted to have it open and flexible in order to let any other form as well as the transferable vote be adopted. I think it would be quite wrong to leave it open to successive Parties to manoeuvre in that way. However, he did admit that it led to a multiplicity of Parties. My suggestion was: let us take what we have, and there is a way in the Constitution by which the Constitution can be amended if experience should suggest that an amendment is desirable. My attitude towards P. R. has been called into question. I remember back in 1919 when it was introduced here. It was an English measure. There is no use in talking about where it arose —it was an English measure and it was in that respect that we had to deal with it. As President of Sinn Féin at the time, I said we would take it. In our circumstances, although it was intended to harm us — looking at it, it seems just. Like many others, I was, to some extent, deceived by the mathematical appearance of justness. I took it on that particular basis. But, [2342] for an appearance of mathematical justice, are we now going to sacrifice political common sense? In dealing with political matters there are approximations in practically everything. There is nothing refined, so to speak, about it. It is a rough and ready common-sense procedure, and there is no sense in carrying refinement too far in one direction when you cannot have it in other directions. We know that a voter does not vote in the same sort of way, for instance, for a panel of candidates as, let us say, a conclave of Cardinals would, over a period thinking over it, vote, say for the Pope. That is not the sort of thing we have in the ordinary voting. You get each individual voter trying to do his best at it but you have not that continuous procedure that you have in the case I have referred to. There is no use in refining certain parts when in the other there are rough approximations. It reminds me of the student who, having got, let us say, two numbers, each accurate to four significant figures, multiplies them and then tells you that the result is accurate to eight significant figures. That is all useless. You have to consider what is the machine as a whole, what you are doing as a whole. In this question as a whole, you are trying, first, to get your Legislature and, secondly, to get your policy. Now, with grouping of Parties that do not come together until after the election, the people have no opportunity whatever of passing judgment. If the Parties came together before the election and put a common policy before the people, I do not think anybody could find fault with that and I have never found any fault with it. The whole tendency of single member constituencies is to get Parties that may be different to come together and to present a common policy, so that people may have some idea of what the policy of the new Government will be, if there is to be a Government composed of a variety of Parties. At least they will then be able to know what the combined policy is. To come together afterwards, when bargaining has taken place, when the [2343] people have no opportunity whatever of passing judgment upon it, is defeating one of the fundamental things there should be in democracy, defeating the right of the people to decide upon policy. You are also defeating the right of the people to get an idea of what their Government will be like. Let us say that it is admitted that P. R. leads to a large number of Parties. If you have a large number of Parties you do not even know in advance what the grouping will be. The voter has no idea in advance of what the grouping is—and the grouping can change in the lifetime of a single Parliament if you have groups in a certain way. There has been talk about the stability we have got. I believe you have largely got the stability you have got and that we have been saved from some of the worst effects of P. R. since the war mainly because Fianna Fáil took up a sound position. We refused to go into the market or to do anything of that kind. Even when we were a minority, we could have got support from others but we refused to look for that support. In 1948, we were elected with more representatives than all the other organised Parties put together. It would have been very much easier for us to bid for the support of other people than it was for Fine Gael to do it, but we deliberately kept out and said at the time we were not going to the market, that we wanted to be there as the bulwark of the nation—and we held that position. It was suggested, as a matter of fact, that never again would any political Party get a majority. There was a possibility of that, I will admit, a great possibility. If Fianna Fáil did go into the market as the other Parties had done, then we were just back into the position in which other countries got involved where there was multiplicity of Parties because it is multiplicity of Parties that we are opposing. We are asked why are we doing it now. I have explained more than once already why we are bringing in this measure at the present time. We are bringing it in during the lifetime of this Government because we have a sufficient majority to see that this question is put to the people. If we [2344] were not in that position, the people would never get a chance of deciding this important matter for themselves. We are doing this because we think it is in the national interest, and we are doing it now because at this period in the lifetime of our Government the question of the revision of constituencies arises. It would be ridiculous to proceed with that revision if we had the intention of putting this measure before the people later. The single member constituency and the non-transferable vote will, in my opinion, give to this nation a stability which it will not get by any other means. The difficulty is that if this other system should get to the point at which no Party had a majority, then the question could never go to the people. The various Parties on the opposite side of the House are trying to prevent our putting this measure to the people. If the present system continued until such time as no Party could get a majority, you might have to wait a considerable period of years to rectify the position. In other countries they were not able to do it when it was necessary. We are seeing to it anyway, whatever the result, and I hope in the interests of the country the result will be to have the single member constituency and the non-transferable vote, as indicated in this Bill. The people will have the opportunity of deciding, and that is what the Opposition are trying to prevent. Once this Bill goes through or before that they can use all the arguments they like with the people, but their opposition here is an endeavour to prevent this measure from being passed so that the people can pass judgment on it. The Leader of the Opposition in speaking on this question taunted me with making a poor case and said he would have made a better case were he in my position. I have no doubt whatever that he would. I am sure he was one of the leading lights who produced a famous advertisement appearing in the newspapers of June 4th, 1927. Before I deal with that I should like to refute the suggestion that we were entering a Coalition at [2345] that time. We did not suggest or propose anything of the kind. There was no Coalition, but we were prepared to support a Government just as the Labour Party supported us. There was no Coalition between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil during the years in which Labour supported us. It has been suggested that we have had stable conditions here as a result of P. R. We have had stable conditions here because on occasions when stability was threatened we went to the people. It has also been contended that we went too often to the people, that we had too many elections. When we got a majority we did not have to hold an election, but when we were being pressed by the support of minor Parties in the Dáil to do things which we did not think right in the national interest we went to the people and got a majority. It was by going to the people in 1933 after the 1932 election, in 1938 after the election of 1937 and in 1944 after the 1943 election that we were able to get stability, and when we got that stability there was no rushing to the people. Those Parliaments ran practically for the full course. There was a four-year period from 1933 to 1937. In 1937, when the Constitution was going through, it was desirable to have a general election and the referendum at the same time in order to save expense. There was a five-year period of office from 1938 to 1943. Before the 1948 election, we were defeated in some by-elections and there was a situation in which it was desirable again in the interests of the State to go to the people. I wish now to revert to this famous advertisement. As I have said, I feel certain the Leader of the Opposition would have made a very much better case than I did because I do not know anybody who made a better case than he did against coalition government, and that is what P. R. and a multiplicity of Parties mean. If they mean anything they mean coalition government. I have here a photostat of the actual page in which this Cumann na nGaedheal advertisement appeared. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition had his part [2346] in drafting it, and I do not know any better case or a case made so succinctly against P. R. and Coalition Government. It says: 'Your choice.' Then it says: 'Your fight in this election is a fight for government.' The word 'government' is underlined. In other words the electors were voting not merely for a legislature or on questions of local interest but for a Government. Then it goes on to say: 'There are only three possible Governments.' It enumerates them in three columns and says what each means. In one column you have a Republican Government. Of course they have that in inverted commas and proceed to say what that would mean. In the third column they tell us what a Cumann na nGaedheal Government would mean, but in the centre they have the Coalition Government and they tell the voters that is what they are voting for if they give their first vote to Independents, Farmers or Labour. Then they go on to say what it means if they do that and what this type of Government means. It means: '(1) Bargaining for place and power between irresponsible minority groups.' Is that true or is it not? Does Coalition Government mean bargaining for place and power between irresponsible minority groups? Everyone who was living in this country in 1948 knows perfectly well it does mean that, and if there is any doubt in anyone's mind as to whether it would mean that or not, they have only to turn their minds back to 1948 and ask themselves what happened in 1948. As I said, ours was a Party that was returned with a number of representatives equal to or greater than all other Parties put together, but bargaining between the other Parties took place, they got some Independents to help them, and they came back and pretended they were elected as a Government by the Irish people. They were not elected as a Government by the Irish people. The people who voted for them voted in favour of certain people, and it was said that by doing so they had voted against Fianna Fáil. It is all very well to say that to vote for A is to vote against B. That bargaining [2347] did take place precisely as Deputy Costello, if he were standing here and arguing against Coalition Government, would argue. That is the argument he would use. It is a true argument. It is proved to be true, and no wonder then that he could say he would argue better here on this side than I could argue. The next point in the advertisement is 'A weak Government with no stated policy.' Is it or is it not true that Coalition Governments do mean weak Government and no stated policy that has been put before the country? They mean weak Governments because they are dependent on the support of various groups that are being pressed from outside. We had Labour representatives outside saying that their Party were not working as a loyal team. The second point is equally true, that it does mean weak Government, and no stated policy that the people can see beforehand, no stated policy that can be produced, as was proven when the Coalition Government was in office. The third point in the advertisement was 'Frequent changes of Government.' That is the third thing here. Is it true or is it not true that Coalition Governments do lead to frequent changes of Government? They have done it elsewhere wherever there have been Coalitions. Here you had one Coalition smashed up before the end of their term because one of their groups, or two of their groups, were not prepared to hold on and the others were not prepared to go on. Therefore, that point is true also, and again I pay a compliment to the Leader of the Opposition that if he were here with that case before him he would certainly have been able to make a much better case than I, because he was responsible for that advertisement and at the time I did not believe that all the evils I have seen to flow since would have followed from that. The next thing is the consequences of that—'Consequent depression in trade and industry.' Is it not obvious if you have Governments that are weak and unstable, without stated policies, that nobody can know from day to day in what direction they are going, it will [2348] lead to depression in trade and industry? That also is true and this is the Cumann na nGaedheal advertisement. The next point in that advertisement is: 'No progress, but stability, security and credit in constant danger.' Is it not true that you cannot make progress under such conditions? Is it not true that stability was in danger, that security was in danger and that credit was in danger? Yes, I will make a present of this to the Leader of the Opposition, bow to him and tell him he certainly made a better case than I was able to make, or would have been able to make in this matter. It is suggested that we have suddenly taken up this attitude. Since 1938 I have been speaking against Coalitions. That is 20 years now. You can get speeches of mine going back over that period in which I said that if we were going to have here, from P. R. and the transferable vote, the consequences that appeared to flow in other countries from multiplicity of Parties, then that I would urge the Irish people to get rid of it, and that I thought the Irish people would be wise in getting rid of it. They say we did not talk about P. R. at the last election, but this advertisement was the basis of the one election address which I broadcast. That same advertisement, to my mind, is the best summary of the dangers pertinent to it and the damage done to countries by Coalition Government. I would like to know what the people on the other side of the House will say about this. We have been told some of our people are doubtful about this measure — maybe there are some— but I am as certain as I am here that a very large section of the Fine Gael Party think now as the Cumann na nGaedheal Party thought then. I have to admit that since 1948 I have seen in this very much more than I saw in 1927, but I did see in 1938, and afterwards, what the dangers were and, on a number of occasions, I did say that the people would be wise in getting rid of this system. But the opportunity for giving the people the chance — when does that come? Even if we were convinced of it in 1944 when we had [2349] a majority, we were passing through a period in which it would be altogether inadvisable to attempt to do anything about it. In any case, the people had not had then the practical demonstration which they have had since 1948, and the people can judge what 1948 meant and decide whether I am right or whether the people on the other side are right. The people know what could happen, having seen 1948 to 1951. In the breaking up of 1951 they could see what happened. In the breaking up of 1951 and in the breaking up of the second Coalition, they could see what could happen and they know in that period what did happen. I am practically certain that it was opposition to Coalition Governments that gave us the majority we have to-day. That was the desire of the people: to end Coalition Governments. Any Party that has any hope in itself, that has any policy that it thinks the people will accept, any policy for the good of the people, should be very glad to get rid of this system. It is only those who want Coalitions, who know they never can themselves get a majority those who want to try from within to sabotage, [2350] if you like, the whole system, who want P. R. The Nazis went in saying that they would use the Liberal — the Weimar —Constitution to destroy the system. There are people who want to use the democratic system, when it gives them the opportunity to do it, to destroy democracy, and it is to defend democracy, to see that the people will not be deprived, by manoeuvring of that sort, of their rights to determine their Government, to determine their policy, that we are introducing this measure. I recommend this measure to the Dáil and to the Seanad, and I recommend it to the people. The people will be the final judges, and I hope that when they come to vote on it, they will bear in mind the opportunity that is being given to them. It is an opportunity which can be given only when there is a Government with its own majority, and it cannot be given once the position is reached in which you have no Party strong enough to put it through.

2219756,865,9,131,"National Development Corporation Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).",05/11/1985,Mr. Thomas G. O'Donnell,Fine Gael,Limerick East,"Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an deis seo agam fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo chun an Chorporáid Forbartha Náisiúnta a bhunú, agus déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire as ucht gur éirigh leis taréis tamaill fhada an Bille seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Is é mo thuairimse gurb é seo an Bille is tábhachtaí atá tagaithe os comhair na Parlaiminte ar feadh 30 bliain ó bunaíodh [1247] an Foras Tionscail sna caogaidí. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an chorporáid na mílte jobanna a chur ar fáil. Gan aon amhras is í an dí-fhostaíocht an fhadhb is mó atá le réiteach agus tá géar-ghá le Bille mar seo i láthair na huaire. As one who has been a consistent and enthusiastic advocate of the concept of a National Development Corporation for a long time, I sincerely welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House. I have been a Member of the House for 24 years and this Bill has had a longer gestation period than any other legislation I remember. The first Government which seriously considered the concept of a National Development Corporation was the Coalition Government led by Liam Cosgrave of which I had the honour to be a member. The idea was floated in 1976 or 1977 but, unfortunately, there was no time to bring the Bill to fruition because there was a change of Government in 1977. The idea was again mooted in 1981 and at long last the Bill is before us. I was not present for the opening debate on the Bill but I read with great interest the various contributions after the Minister, Deputy Bruton, introduced it a fortnight ago. Taking into account the enormous challenge facing us because of the magnitude of unemployment, I cannot understand why it has taken three years to bring the Bill before the House nor can I understand the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in their outright opposition to it. Unemployment is a problem throughout the European Community and throughout the western world and it should be quite obvious that there is dire need for new thinking, new strategies and legislation to enable us to face up to the daunting challenge of tackling growing unemployment in a climate of international recession. This Bill has been the subject of much controversy, ideological conflict, academic argument and of most unfair criticism from the Opposition. There are about 250,000 people unemployed. There has been a recession for three or [1248] four years and it is quite obvious to anyone who looks at the situation objectively and realistically that the employment creation agencies and strategies which have been in operation since the fifties when the IDA was established are no longer adequate to tackle the new challenge of employment creation. I have been reading the debates of the fifties whan the IDA was established and it is ironical to see that the same outright opposition which is now being shown towards the National Development Corporation was also expressed in regard to the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority. Members of Fianna Fáil who do not like the Bill now before the House may, as some of their predecessors did, oppose the measure in the Dáil but subsequently find themselves in favour of it. Unemployment is the most serious social problem facing us at present and it is generally agreed that it is an underlying and significant factor to many of the social ills confronting society today. With all due respect to the Government, finding answers to the problem of unemployment should receive a far greater priority than some of the controversial social legislation which has been brought before the House. We must face the fact that we have the youngest population in the EC. They are well educated, highly skilled and competent. We have an unprecedentedly high level of training and educational facilities. However, when the training is over, the education completed and degrees are conferred, the grim prospect of unemployment still faces our young people. I welcome the Bill. It is clear and distinct evidence of the priority the Government are according to the unemployment problem. Much has been said and written about the concept of the National Development Corporation and much time has been wasted in ideological arguments regarding State and public enterprise versus private enterprise. We are a small country and we do not have the wealth and the natural resources of more advanced European countries. I have always held the view that the correct [1249] approach to national development and job creation was to have a realistic and proper mix of State enterprise and private enterprise. I was pleased to find that the Minister in his speech spelled out very clearly the aims and objectives of this legislation. It is not intended that the NDC should replace private enterprise. I was pleased that the Minister spelled out the possibilities of involving the NDC in development of various kinds. He spoke about the scope for joint ventures between public and private enterprise. The private sector will have full opportunities to participate in the various projects that will be taken on board by the NDC. This is as it should be. Now that the legislation is before us and we are about to set up the NDC I hope we will have no more of this silly nonsense about public and private enterprise. We need the proper mix of both to create the new developments and the job opportunities that are so necessary. It has been said that we have too many job creation agencies. We have the IDA, SFADCo, the National Manpower Service, AnCO and so on. It is said that the NDC will duplicate some of the work of those agencies. It has also been stated that there could be conflict between the IDA and the NDC but I see no reason why there should be any conflict. I do not accept that the NDC will be a superfluous organisation. They will meet a need and will fill a gap not catered for by existing State agencies or by private enterprise. The IDA was established 30 years ago. They have done a tremendous job and have made a valuable contribution to industrial development and job creation. The main thrust of their strategy throughout the sixties and seventies was in the attraction of foreign investment. They succeeded admirably and many thousands of people are employed as a result of that strategy. However, we must face the fact that because of the world recession that has existed for some years the task of attracting foreign investment has become almost impossible. Those of us in the European Parliament who are familiar with the European scene are aware that the countries from which the [1250] IDA succeeded in attracting substantial investment throughout the sixties and the seventies have not been investing abroad in the past few years. It is as simple as that. Even West Germany which is an advanced industrial nation and a place from which we have been successful in attracting substantial industries has been in the process of consolidating because the recession has hit industry in that country also. We cannot rely in the next decade on attracting foreign investment to solve our unemployment problem and to create jobs to the same degree that existed in the past two decades. An alternative strategy must be devised and the obvious strategy is to look to our own resources. We have to examine what natural resources we have, to what degree they can be developed and to what degree industries and jobs based on those resources can be created. The purpose of the NDC is enshrined clearly in the Bill and it was spelled out clearly by the Minister when he introduced it. The NDC have exciting possibilities for substantial job creation. Much of the criticism has been due to the fact that it offers a completely new dimension to the national job creation strategy. It may be asked why I am so enthusiastic about the NDC. I will give some practical examples of where State participation and private enterprise have been successful to a remarkable degree. I refer to the ESB, to Bord na Móna and to the Irish Sugar Company, all of which have utilised our natural resources. When I was Minister for the Gaeltacht, Gaeltarra Éireann was the development authority for the Gaeltacht. There has been talk about industries that failed in the Gaeltacht but many successful enterprises were established there. We are an island country. We have a fishing industry that is in a shambles because it has not been properly developed. The only fish canning plant is in Dungloe in County Donegal. It was established in 1975 in a joint partnership between the State and private enterprise. Up to then there was no fish cannery in the country because private enterprise was not prepared to establish such a plant. However, an [1251] entrepreneur in Donegal, a man who was successful in the fish processing business, put forward the proposal to establish a fish cannery and as Minister I sanctioned a substantial State investment. The cannery has been very successful and other fish processing plants have been established. The Minister referred to the link between the universities and technology and industry and job creation. This is a very important area and I see tremendous scope for the National Development Corporation here. In 1974 I was invited to visit the Marine Biology Research Station in Carna, County Galway, which is run by University College, Galway, under the direction of Professor Ó Ciardha. Professor Keady showed me the wonderful research work in the field of marine biology and the development of mariculture which is being carried out there. He told me thay had perfected a technique to artifically grow oysters and mussels. I asked him what would happen next and he replied that that depended on the Government. I asked him what the problem was and he said that private enterprise would not develop and commercially apply their research. I succeeded in getting from the Government an investment of £500,000 for that industry. To date fish farming has been developed to a remarkably successful degree in the Gaeltacht, to the extent that it is being advocated as a very good development project in non-Gaeltacht areas. I have not seen the latest figures for the export of shellfish from the company set up in 1975, but I believe it runs into many millions of pounds. Professor Timoney, an outstanding example of an academic turned entrepreneur, was anxious to apply the results of his research in the mechanical engineering faculty, University College, Dublin, practically by establishing commercial companies and providing jobs. He developed the Timoney armoured car, which was a source of great amusement at the time. We helped him to establish a business in the Meath Gaeltacht. That original concept has now been [1252] applied to armoured vehicles, fire engines and so on. Converting this type of research into a commercial enterprise is a costly and slow business and private enterprise is not inclined to take it up. There is a massive horticultural industry in the Dingle Gaeltacht where there is a substantial area under glass. This industry was established because a State agency had a mandate to invest State funds in projects of that kind. I have already referred to the fishing industry, but I believe the NDC can play a major role in the development of the fishing industry, fish processing and added-value projects. I hope one of the first steps the National Development Corporation will take will be to examine the food processing industry. It is often said that we do not have very many natural resources, but land is one of our major natural resources and our agricultural industry can and should be developed. Many experts who examined the potential of the food processing industry said there is potential for the creation of 30,000 new jobs if the industry is developed and the products marketed properly. Our forests have been neglected since the foundation of the State. We do not have a proper timber processing industry. We import an enormous amount of timber every year, running into many millions of pounds. There is need for a new approach to the development of afforestation and a national timber processing industry. There was a recent controversy about the proposal to sell off our forests. The NDC could set up a holding company which would promote a more vigorous tree planting policy, organise our forests properly and establish a timber processing industry. I do not accept that the NDC is superfluous. As I said on a number of occasions, there are several projects in the pipeline which have not been able to get off the ground simply because private enterprise are not willing to get involved. One reason may be that research and development take a very long time and [1253] are very costly, but this is an area where the NDC can fruitfully intervene. The Minister also referred to the tourist industry and the possibility of the NDC participating in a new, imaginative, dynamic tourism development project. In recent years we have been successful in promoting small industry. It is generally realised in the western world that small industry can make a major contribution to national job creation and has a vital role to play. SFADCo have a special mandate to deal with the development of small industries and they have a lot of experience of the problems in this area, particularly in relation to marketing and exports. The NDC can and should intervene in this field. A special holding company should be able to provide venture and other types of capital for small industries and, most important, provide an umbrella export organisation where small companies could come together and form an export company in which the NDC could participate. These are some of the areas where I see great possibilities for the National Development Corporation. I am disappointed at the attitude of the Opposition to this Bill.

1018484,894,9,93,Adjournment Debate—Government Policy.,10/12/1959,Mr. Michael Joseph O'Higgins,Fine Gael,Dublin South-West,"At the rate you are going, I do not think you will be in for five years. However, the idea was something in the region of 15,000 to 25,000 new jobs a year. Lest Deputy Booth should think I am in any way misrepresenting the facts or misinterpreting the message which Fianna Fáil wanted to give the electorate at the last general election, may I remind him that when the Minister for Defence was even more of a greenhorn in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party than he is today, he gave his interpretation of the results of the general election and he told us across the floor of the House why Fianna Fáil were put into office. If Deputy Booth cares to consult the Dáil Debates of the 15th May, 1957, he will see that at columns 1283 and 1284, he had this to say: In my opinion, and in the opinion of any fair-minded person who even now goes back and looks over the speeches made in the election campaign, it is beyond all doubt that we were put in here as a Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation of mass unemployment and emigration brought about by the previous Government. Again, in column 1288 of the Dáil Debates of the same day, the Minister for Defence said: The people who have been affected by that unemployment and resulting emigration have put their faith in Fianna Fáil to remedy this situation, in the full knowledge that there would probably be a period of comparative austerity before progress towards remedying the situation became apparent. Fianna Fáil have now been there for more than half of a full period in office and on the 11th of last month a question was put down by Deputy [1420] Lynch to the Taoiseach. The information given to Deputy Lynch in reply to that question, regarding persons in insurable employment over the years 1956 to 1959, showed that as between 1956 and 1959 there were 40,000 fewer people in employment than before Fianna Fáil became the Government. Remember, this is the Government which is supported by Deputy Booth who pledged themselves in all their speeches and propaganda during the general election that they were the Party who would give full employment they were the Party who were to end emigration and cure unemployment they were the Party who were to create 100,000 new jobs. We find that, half way through their period of office, their best boast so far as employment is concerned, is that they have succeeded in pushing out of employment 40,000 people who were in employment before the present Fianna Fáil Government came into office. Is that anything to be proud of?

871789,781,9,167,Committee on Finance. - Motion by Minister for Finance.,10/03/1954,Mr. Daniel Morrissey,Fine Gael,Tipperary,"It is easy to say these things when running away out of the House. Either the skin of the Minister for Finance is getting a little more tender or my tongue a little more sharp. He did not formerly run away like that. All the ballyhoo we have listened to to-day, all the ballyhoo we had from the Minister for External Affairs, all the long and laboured speech we had from Deputy Briscoe and all the whining we had from Deputy Cogan was all devoted to one purpose to try to get the minds of [1568] the House and the country off this fact, that, on last Thursday, the Taoiseach got the biggest shock he ever got in his political life, and that, side by side with the announcement of the final result of the Cork election, came the announcement from the Taoiseach that, following on the two by-elections, a general election, in his opinion should be held and would he held as soon as the financial measures necessary for the carrying on of the public services had been completed. Now we are told that we misunderstood the Taoiseach. It is not to-day or yesterday that we heard him for the first time or read him for the first time. It is not to-day or yesterday that we knew that he was apparently incapable of saying in a straightforward manner anything about anything. We made full allowance for that fact, but it was quite clear, and is still, beyond any shadow of a doubt, to any person who has any knowledge whatever of parliamentary procedure that that statement on Thursday night could mean one thing and one thing only—that, when the Vote on Account was passed by the House, the Taoiseach would ask the President to dissolve the Parliament. There is no question about that. As surely as I am standing here, that is what the Taoiseach meant. He had no reservation whatever about it and he practically admitted it here to-day at Question Time. We were told that he consulted with his Cabinet colleagues, that he consulted the Tánaiste in London and that he had given full and careful consideration to it, but he was able to do all that in an amazingly short time, because, within five minutes of the final result being telephoned or telegraphed from Cork, the Taoiseach's statement was on the air and if we had any doubt in our minds as to what he meant, he let it out to-day himself here and it will be on the records of this House. What happened in the meantime? Did the new leader when he came back from London change the record? Did the new leader of the Party tell the Taoiseach that he was losing some [1569] of that political astuteness of his, that he had taken a hasty decision? Did the new leader lead a revolt of the Party against the Taoiseach's decision? Did the Party feel that the Taoiseach was making the same mistake as that which they accused him of making early in 1948 about a general election? What pressure was brought on the Taoiseach to get him to issue last night over the radio a statement completely and absolutely opposed to the statement he made last Thursday night? Those are the questions to which the House and the country are entitled to get an answer. If the Taoiseach was satisfied, as he said himself he was, that he had lost the confidence of the people of the country to such an extent that he believed a general election should take place, if the present Government is a discredited Government, as it is, in the eyes of the people, what right have they to prolong their own lives for a period of ten weeks? Did any Government in this or any other country ever get in such clear and unambiguous language a notice to quit as the present Government got last Thursday? To use an expression which is more familiar to Deputy Vivion de Valera than to me, the Taoiseach wants a stay of execution for ten weeks I hope the House will not give it to him. Certainly he has to make a much better case for it—he would have to make that in the District Court much less here—than he has made. The Goverment did get a notice to quit and are now looking for a stay of execution for ten weeks. What they are really looking for is an opportunity to bring in here, to concoct or to devise by some or any means, a Budget which they believe, or hope, will fool the people. It is beyond the wit even of Fianna Fáil to devise a Budget that will deceive the people in their present mood. It cannot be done. The people are not going to be deceived any longer, and all the tripe we get from Deputies like Deputy Cogan is not going to alter the position. This Government is a discredited Government—completely discredited. Deputy Cogan talks about the programme [1570] of this Government and about the honesty of this Government, and he had the audacity to assert here within the past hour and a half that the Fianna Fáil Government had kept every promise they made. Deputy Cogan himself, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan were induced to give, in the first instance, their support to Fianna Fáil on the Minister's and the Taoiseach's emphatic promise, not merely verbal but set down in writing in their famous 17 points, that the food subsidies would not be reduced or interfered with. That was a clear and most emphatic promise. That was the promise made which got certain Deputies, so-called Independent Deputies, to give their support before they were finally admitted to membership—that admission to membership being, in my opinion, another piece of evidence of the straits to which the Fianna Fáil Party were reduced. Those Deputies, this House and the country were given the unqualified promise that the subsidies would not be touched. The Minister for Finance, when it was asserted that if they got back into office they would reimpose the duty on beer, tobacco and spirits, said he would not and his colleagues reiterated that statement inside and outside the House. When he got back into office, not merely did he reimpose the duties on beer, spirits and tobacco but he said, in the course of that speech, that the additional duties which were imposed by his colleague, Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Finance, in 1947 should never have been removed by us. That was said—it is on the record—by the Minister who said it was not his intention to reimpose those duties. That was said by his colleagues. What is the use in talking when we had to listen to Deputy Cogan speaking about a 14 per cent. increase in the cost of living? What are the essential foodstuffs for the majority of our people? What are the essential things for the poorest sections of the people of this country? What figures most in their daily lives but bread, tea, sugar and butter? Does the 14. 7 per cent. cover these? What increases have [1571] taken place in a wide range of articles that do not figure in the cost of living index figure at all? The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs consoles himself and tries to console the people down the country by telling us he discovered in his world tour that there are three unnamed countries in the world where the cost of living has risen more than it has risen in this country. The Minister, his colleagues and his Party have been beaten fairly and squarely. They were not beaten by a doughty opponent. They were not beaten by a Party with what they would admit was an intelligent policy but they were beaten by a Party which, according to Fianna Fáil, was a dead Party or a dying Party. They were beaten fairly and squarely on first preference votes. I venture to say that after Louth and Cork we will not hear as many whispers or even as many audible remarks about the desirability of changing from the proportional representation system back to the old system of the single vote. It might not suit Fianna Fáil so well now as they thought it would suit them on one occasion. They may make all the excuses they like. They may twist and distort everything. They may talk at the crossroads about the debts left to them by the inter-Party Government. They may talk in the Dáil or write in the leading article of the Irish Press about commitments—they were driven away from the word debts—but it does not alter the fact that they have lost the confidence of the people of this country in a most remarkable and spectacular way. The results of Cork and Louth, not to speak of the other places, are the angry reactions of the people against the infliction on them of a harshness and of hardships to a degree they are satisfied it was not necessary to inflict on them and to a degree they should not have to suffer. I know there are certain members of the Government who will try to be rather supercilious about the people—perhaps, they do not express the feeling although the Taoiseach once said that the people were never right unless they were in [1572] step with Fianna Fáil—and who pay a lot of lip service to the rights of democracy and the people who choose the Government and this House but who want to deny the people the right to change the House at the time the people themselves want to change it. There is only one reason why the Taoiseach was forced. I am perfectly satisfied he was forced whether entirely or partly by the representations of his own colleagues and his own Party. Deputies will remember the leading article in the Irish Times on Saturday last, where the editor patted the Taoiseach on the back of the head and, at the same time, gave him the boot. He had served his purpose and he should now get out. That was worthy of the Irish Times. I will leave it at that. I may have my own view about the Taoiseach's politics, but even that got a bit under my skin. That is the position, and all the speeches Deputies opposite made here and outside will not improve the position one bit. Notwithstanding the results in Cork, Louth, North-West Dublin, East Cork, Limerick and so forth, I do not believe the Fianna Fáil Party fully realise yet how angry the people are with them. I do not think they have any idea of the present mood of the people. I do not think they realise for one moment the landslide or, perhaps, they do. Perhaps, that is the reason why the Taoiseach for the first time in his life was forced off his own course. Perhaps, he was not perfectly conscious of it. I am satisfied that if he dissolved the Dáil now and went to the country he would not stand a dog's chance. You would have the greatest landslide in a general election since this State was founded. Perhaps, it is the gambler's throw in the hope that something may turn up, either internally or internationally, that might help the Taoiseach to stall the election off for another ten weeks. Perhaps, it is also possible that, if the Minister is not able to bring in a Budget with a bit of gilt on it, the Taoiseach may have another interpretation of what he said, as was adverted to to-day, in regard to the [1573] financial arrangements having to be completed. He has not yet, of course, advised the President, but when the time comes he may tell the House and the country that he did not mean at the end of the Budget, that, when he fixed the 18th May, he overlooked the fact that in order to complete the financial arrangements he would have to pass all five stages of the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill and that that could not be done until the middle of August and that we might have a long and detailed discussion on the Estimates. Am I not entitled to say that in view of what happened since Thursday night? Would there be anything more far-fetched in the Taoiseach taking that line if he thought it desirable in the interests of his Party still further to postpone the holding of a general election? As Deputy Costello pointed out to-day, strictly speaking the financial arrangements, interpreted as the Taoiseach interpreted them in his statement of last night and not last Thursday, are not completed until the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill are passed. Why do you not admit you have had it? Why do you not admit that you did not quite succeed in fooling all the people all the time? You did it for 20 years and that was not a bad try. I do not think there is any other Party in Europe that succeeded for so long. But you are found out. Like myself, the astute Leader of the Party is not getting younger although I would still back him against some of the boys who have been advising him between Thursday and last night. He has forgotten more about politics and political manoeuvring than some of them will ever learn. They may be a little more slick or appear to be, but it is not merely a difference in technique. No, there is more than technique at stake there. But may I presume to offer you this little bit of advice? Do not think that the people in their present mood—they have reason to be bitter and you are not going to improve the mood by the way in which you have been carrying on for the last couple of days—are going to suffer lightly any tricking about with their fundamental [1574] rights, particularly their fundamental right to elect the personnel of this House and the Government of the country. The Taoiseach has always been free to talk about all power being derived from the people. He has been very free to talk about the people being allpowerful—some of his colleagues following that line have been even more eloquent—but he has not always been as ready to accept that will when it has been demonstrated and when there has been a clear indication there. Never was a clearer indication given than has been given over the last two years. If there are two men responsible above all others for a lot of the misery and hardship, emigration and unemployment which has occurred, for the increase in interest rates, for restriction in credit, those are the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. We do not forget the autumn of 1952 when in an effort to discredit their predecessors they bansheed from one end of this country to the other about the insecure credit standing of the country, saying it was on the verge of bankruptcy, about their concern as to whether we would be able to meet the demands made on us and to meet our debts. Those are the two principal spokesmen in that particular line of country who are more responsible than any others for the state of emigration. The Minister can afford to smirk he has not had to emigrate and leave his family behind. I want to assert—it does not give me any pleasure to do it and I am closer to it than the Minister—that for the last year and a half emigration from this country has reached almost to the highest level it reached during the war years. There may not be statistics in the Statistics Department for that but the knowledge is in every city, town and village of the country. It is known to the authorities in every village, town and city and to the committees and officers of every sporting club whether it is rugby, soccer, G. A.A., or lawn tennis. I am giving the real picture of this country. We are told that 1953 was the best year in our history. What [1575] evidence is there to support that? We are told that there has been a complete recovery in the business of the country. That is untrue. There is not a businessman, whether he be attached to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, or any other Party, no matter what Party (if any) he subscribes to or supports, who can honestly say that business is anything like as good as it was three or four years ago. There is not a Deputy in this House—and I know I am speaking in the presence of some people who know what I am talking about—who will dare to assert that, with the possible exception of land, any piece of property is nearly as valuable as it was two or three years ago, and that there has not been a drop in values of from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent.

3655609,1003,8,184,Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2006: Second Stage.,04/04/2006,Mr. Dick Roche,Fianna Fáil,Wicklow,"I move amendment No. 1: To delete 'now' and to add at the end of the motion 'this day nine months'. I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Connor. I hope to do the decent thing and I am taking the unusual step of proposing an amendment to postpone the acceptance of Second Stage of the Bill for a nine-month period. I had hoped to move this as a reasoned amendment outlining in the amendment the basis for doing so, but I understand that is not possible. I agree with the general sentiment that this is an area that requires change and specific attention. However, with the best will in the world, it does not achieve this and I will try to explain why and the reason I seek to postpone Second Stage. First, the Law Reform Commission is examining the issue of the regulation of these companies and is expected to report in the near future, which I will encourage. Second, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is developing proposals for a national property services regulatory agency and, third, I consider that legislation will most appropriately be developed in the light of this ongoing work. There are issues which need to be addressed with regard to management companies in Ireland but I am not convinced that the Bill in its current form will address those issues. I do not say this with the intention of putting down the author of the Bill. I accept the sentiment, but the Bill has some fundamental flaws which I will outline. Apartment living has multiplied in Ireland in the past 15 years or so. As the Fine Gael Bill accepts, there is a need for management companies in modern apartment complexes. There is also a need to ensure that people’s hard earned investment in their home is protected by ensuring that [1170]the structure and external fabric of the building is maintained. It is clear that the law in this regard in Ireland has not kept pace with the increase in high density living we now see. Countries with long-standing apartment living have a more sophisticated approach than we have. That is why the Government has asked the Law Reform Commission to examine this issue. It is also the reason the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is developing proposals for a national property services regulatory authority. The Government does not oppose the thinking behind this Bill. We are happy to work constructively with all interested parties to review current arrangements, but there are some fundamental problems. I understand the Bill was only printed over the weekend and the House has not had the opportunity to review all its provisions. However, from an initial view there are problems in its approach in some regards. If we passed it, I do not think Fine Gael would get any marks for regulatory impact analysis. To rush this Bill and get an unsatisfactory result would be a disservice to apartment dwellers and would be counter-productive to what we intend to do in the area. It is for those reasons that I propose to postpone the Bill. There are a number of serious questions about the approach proposed in this Bill, including the level of bureaucratic involvement it implies, which I will outline in more detail. The proposal that the private residential tenancies board, PRTB, should be involved in regulating the relationship between property owners and managing agents would not be appropriate and would seriously detract from the PRTB’s role with regard to landlord and tenant matters in the private rented accommodation. We must remember the reason the PRTB was established was to operate the new landlord and tenant system in the private rented sector. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to give the board this additional role. The whole area of property management is complex, involving a number of different dimensions and issues, including the role of developers, managing agents and their relationships the role and responsibilities of management companies the role of the new property services regulatory agency practical issues such as the standard of maintenance, level of and increases in management charges the application of conveyancing law and practice in this area issues relating to the operation of owner-controlled management companies and requirements of company law in that context and linkage, in some cases, between planning conditions and provisions relating to management companies in purchase contracts. I am less than happy with the way some local authorities have operated in this area. [1171]The Bill before us, as drafted, is not capable of capturing all these different, complex and interrelated elements. We would do people a disservice by not incorporating these diverse issues in legislation we produce. In its current format the Bill would not deal with a number of key issues that give rise to problems. I will return to this issue. The Government will address the problems on a number of fronts, particularly in the context of the upcoming report from the Law Reform Commission. My Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will jointly prepare a report for the Government on the work done to date on this issue. The legal issues involved are generally outside my area of responsibility. However, I am concerned, both from the perspective of my Department’s housing role and the need for householders to get a fair deal, to promote practical action to tackle the problems we have come across. The solutions to problems in this area do not depend entirely on statutory action. Many, indeed most, of the difficulties that have come to light are attributable to what might charitably be termed shoddy practice on the part of certain interested parties. Deputy Connaughton spoke wisely on this and pointed out that some of the information on conveyancing given to clients leaves much to be desired. Property owners in multi-unit structures must be put in a position which will allow them to ensure that their management companies operate effectively and in the common interest. There are many instances where unit owners have been prevented from taking effective control of the management entity. There also tends to be an information deficit in this area, which is inimical to the effective operation of management arrangements, particularly through the control of those arrangements by the owners. We will address these deficiencies through legislation where necessary and in the meantime through practical measures. The legal profession also has a key role in protecting home buyers from abuses. Conveyancers need to be vigilant in ensuring that the rights of buyers are fully safeguarded from inappropriate obligations or excessive costs in house purchase contracts, particularly where buyers feel pressurised in the context of a rising property market. I hope that the legal profession as a whole will be able to help raise the level of protection further and I will expand on this later. Local authorities must also play their part. In particular they must avoid adding to complexities or uncertainty in the context of applying planning conditions relating to management arrangements. My Department is pursuing this aspect with local authorities. Local authorities have taken a diverse [1172]range of actions and we will make it clearer to them what we expect in this regard. A basic source of difficulty in the area is the general lack of information and understanding about the need for and role of management companies and the rights and obligations of home owners. As an immediate practical step to address this information deficit, I have asked my Department to co-ordinate the provision of clear and concise general information, particularly for home buyers. In the past ten years alone over 100,000 apartments have been built. Apartment complexes have special management and maintenance needs because of the extent of shared or communal elements involved. Interdependence is an inherent feature of apartment living. This necessitates a range of rights and responsibilities with a mechanism for upholding, enforcing and where necessary, reconciling these, in the interest of all the owners and residents. The fact that most apartment buildings accommodate different tenures, and in some cases a mix of residential and commercial use, adds a further level of complexity. Arrangements for managing and maintaining the communal elements of private apartment complexes are generally addressed through management companies. The appropriate practice is that shortly after the sale of all units in an apartment complex is complete, control of the management company is transferred from the developer to the owners of the individual units. The legal requirements relating to membership of these companies and associated obligations are brought to bear through the conveyancing process. A cause of confusion in this area is misunderstanding of the role of 'management companies' and 'managing agents', because we tend to use the two terms interchangeably. It may be more meaningful to regard management companies as 'ownership' companies or vehicles. On the other hand, property managing agents or management service providers are commercial entities engaged by management companies to carry out day-to-day operations. These agents appear to be a key source of problems and complaints from apartment owners, particularly regarding levels of fees, quality of service and accountability. Problems have arisen from a range of factors, including failings on the part of developers or managing agents, poor administration of management companies, often due to inadequate participation by apartment owners, refusal of some owners to pay charges and the fact that some requirements under company law do not appear to be well suited to the circumstances of apartment management companies. These are complex issues which must be dealt with systematically. The proposed new national property services regulatory authority is intended to regulate these operations. It will have the function of licensing, regulating and dealing with complaints about [1173]property management service providers or agents. The group which recommended the establishment of the regulatory authority also recommended that agents be subject to oversight by the authority, to vetting and complaints procedures and that managing agents should contribute to a fidelity fund to be operated by the authority. This addresses some of the core issues raised by Deputy O’Dowd and will be a most important development because it is clear the operation of managing agents is a major element of many of the problems that arise with regard to property management. Another major source of potential difficulties arises at the stage when the buyer of a house or apartment signs the contract to purchase. It is at this point that the obligation to become a member of the management company and make relevant financial contributions tends to arise. A key issue in this context is control of the management company. A fundamental source of current problems is the fact that house buyers can be obliged to sign contracts under which they have obligations, including hefty charges, with regard to management companies, but have no guarantee that they will be able to influence the operation of these companies because developers can use artifices to retain effective control of management companies. They do this, of course, because there is a profit for them in so doing. This seems to derive from the fact that standard conveyancing practice and documentation allows a way for developers, if they so wish, to retain control of these companies indefinitely by keeping ownership of at least one unit in the development. A specific time limit must be set for the transfer of control of the management company from developers to the owners of units. Deputy O’Dowd pointed out that the basic conveyancing instrument was established long before communal living became common. A number of other issues arise with regard to conditions in house purchase contracts relating to management arrangements. The level of management charges is a particular focus of complaint. Provisions relating to management arrangements must provide for the reasonableness and adequacy of charges. The allocation of responsibilities and associated costs between developers and management companies and their members seems to be a source of particular difficulty. This issue is not, nor could it be, properly dealt with in this Bill. The effectiveness or otherwise of the operation of the management company after control passes to the owners of units is another important issue which must be dealt with in comprehensive legislation. It is precisely because there is a complex interplay of different legislative codes and differing practical and legal issues in this area that the Government requested the Law Reform Com[1174]mission to convene an expert group to examine all of the issues that arise in the case of multi-unit structures. The commission’s consultation paper is likely to be published by the summer. I expect this report will address the various issues to which I have referred. Another very important matter that will be addressed in the report is mechanisms to deal with situations where problems have already occurred, whether through defects or inadequacies in conveyancing documentation or problems with the constitution or operation of management companies. Obviously if we are to have an even playing field, we must address the deficiencies which already exist, in addition to putting controls in place for the future. The Government will consider the recommendations in the Law Reform Commission’s final report, including the need for any new legislation in this area. Without pre-empting the commission’s recommendations, it seems likely some provisions in conveyancing law will probably be needed to deal with some of the problems that have come to light with regard to property management arrangements. I am very conscious of problems being experienced by apartment owners and am determined to do everything in my power to resolve them. However, the solution to all of these problems will not be achieved by way of a very short Bill, however well intentioned it may be. If we were to take this particular step, as outlined in the Bill, we would not be doing anybody a service. That is why I am suggesting the delay of nine months. It takes time to have new legislation drawn up and enacted, particularly in complex areas like this. Even though legislative action is not likely to arise primarily in my area of responsibility, I am determined to ensure any practical action that might help improve matters in the short term will be actively pursued. Something of a side issue to the question of management arrangements has emerged in terms of a small number of local authorities imposing planning conditions requiring the establishment of management companies. This matter has been raised in parliamentary questions by Deputy Catherine Murphy and others and is one which also concerns me. Concern has been raised that some conditions have been drafted in a way, or applied in circumstances, that may permit uncertainty, at the very least, about the responsibility of developers to complete residential developments and to maintain and repair infrastructure. Provisions of the planning laws should not be used to transfer responsibility for public infrastructure, such as roads, footpaths, sewers, water mains and public lighting in housing estates to the residents, although I have a suspicion that some local authority officials may have that at the back of their minds. Last January the Department issued a circular letter to planning authorities [1175]reminding them of their responsibilities under the Planning and Development Act 2000. It also reiterated that the existence of a management company to maintain elements of common buildings should not be used to frustrate the taking in charge of estates. The majority of planning authorities do not attach conditions to planning permissions requiring management companies to be set up, although a number do and I will be encouraging local authorities to discontinue this inappropriate practice. While the legal framework is an important element, insufficient awareness on the part of owners as to how apartment complex management arrangements work and a lack of appreciation of their own responsibilities and powers has contributed to problems. The maintenance and management of private apartment complexes is ultimately the responsibility of the apartment owners, just as any house owner has to take responsibility for his or her home. In the apartment complex context, this is catered for in a communal way through management companies but it must be stressed that ultimately control of these companies must rest with the apartment owners and not a third party which is using them as a source of revenue. If there are problems with the way a company is operating, it is primarily the responsibility of the owners, who are the company, to have these addressed. Legislative measures to ensure timely transfer of control of management companies to owners and to enable these to operate effectively will be considered in light of the Law Reform Commission report. I expect the report will also address the need for consumer protection provisions such as requirements on developers to provide information and guidance to prospective buyers. I encourage buyers of apartments to ensure their solicitors examine carefully any clauses in contracts dealing with management arrangements and obligations. There is a particular onus on conveyancers to help protect buyers from any exploitation in this context. It would be desirable, in advance of any legislation, if a rigorous approach could be taken across the profession against inappropriate, even if not strictly illegal, contractual clauses relating to management companies to help squeeze out bad practices. Under the Government’s proposals, regulation of managing agents will be the responsibility of the new national property services regulatory authority. Legislation is being drafted to provide for the establishment of the authority and to detail its regulatory regime. I do not know what this will contain ultimately, but I expect it will provide for a much better level of control than that proposed in the Private Members’ Bill. I unreservedly agree with the need to make adequate provision for a sinking fund so sufficient [1176]funds are available to carry out major renovation. However, as I have stressed, it would be unwise to proceed with legislation without the benefit of the Law Reform Commission’s recommendations as such issues require specific attention under law. I am suggesting the agreement of standard clauses in relation to sinking funds and other clearly identified matters for inclusion in all conveyancing documentation. The Private Members’ Bill seems to suggest that managing agents should be responsible for the provision of information on the rights and responsibilities of residents and on how management companies work, to the management company members. As managing agents are employed by management companies, is it appropriate to give them the role of educating their employers? 8 o’clock The Bill is predicated on the assumption that property management agencies are an inevitable feature of all apartment buildings. This is not the case as smaller complexes tend not to employ managing agents. Management companies of some larger complexes, whose owner-members are active, may decide to contract the required services directly and not utilise an agency. Is it wise for the legislation to be specific on these functions? How would the Bill justify making the Private Residential Tenancies Board, whose mandate relates to private rented accommodation, responsible for the regulation of managing agents and their relationships with owners of apartments and the management companies of which they are members? How would such a proposal fit with the auctioneering review group recommendation, with which the Government agrees, that the proposed national property services regulatory authority should have responsibility for regulation of managing agents? How would it ensure such a major change would not undermine the role of the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the important functions it is performing in the private rented sector? How would the board be in a position to address property management issues on behalf of apartment owners related to aspects of conveyancing and company law? The proposed functions are not appropriate to the board and would divert it from its core task of implementing and taking forward much-needed reforms in the private rental sector. It is essential that the board is allowed to continue its key role, which is still in the course of development, of providing a means for upholding the rights of tenants and supporting a professional approach by landlords. To divert the board from these functions would take from this important work. It would be unfortunate given that little attention was paid in the past to the sector, which is what the Residential Tenancies Act sought to redress. The promoters of the Bill can ponder on these questions. I will be interested to hear views on [1177]these matters in the course of the debate and on how the entire range of issues relating to management of multi-unit structures can be effectively and comprehensively addressed. I am reluctant to oppose the Bill as I have sympathy with its main objectives. However, the Bill as presented is deficient. That is why I am suggesting this approach. Members will know that my approach is based on good will towards the Bill and on an anxiety to resolve the problem.",04/04/2006,29,2416,2418,local authorities imposing planning conditions requiring the establishment of management companies This matter has been raised in parliamentary questions by,Deputy Catherine Murphy,and others and is one which also concerns me Concern has been raised that some conditions have been drafted in,Deputy Catherine Murphy,3655609_7,,local authorities imposing planning conditions requiring the establishment of management companies This matter has been raised in parliamentary questions by Deputy Catherine Murphy and others and is one which also concerns me Concern has been raised that some conditions have been drafted in,local authorities imposing planning conditions requiring the establishment of management companies This matter has been raised in parliamentary questions by and others and is one which also concerns me Concern has been raised that some conditions have been drafted in,text44,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,-0.166019577,-0.004150489,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.145145145,0.175175175,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

4022207,2015,8,26,European Union Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed).,21/10/2009,Mr. Timmy Dooley,Fianna Fáil,Clare,"I would like to believe this is a reflection of the work I did. The extent of the 'No' vote may reflect the work of Deputy Ó Snodaigh. Perhaps the outcome was based on our work and not on the level of satisfaction, or otherwise, with the Government. The result in my county does not reflect the current level of satisfaction with the Government given the difficult measures it must introduce. This is understandable and is well recognised. The second referendum campaign was good and well fought on both sides. There were some disingenuous elements, but I am certainly not accusing Deputy Ó Snodaigh in this regard. He has had the opportunity to debate this issue on a number of occasions and at all times he was balanced. I might not have agreed with his approach, particularly on the economy but, to the best of my knowledge, neither he nor any of the members of his party sought to draw on issues extraneous to the treaty which could not, according to any fair-minded person’s approach, be linked therewith. Unfortunately, however, some individuals continued to draw on extraneous issues during the second referendum campaign. The debate during the second campaign was better informed than that during the first. I disagree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh’s suggestions that it was through coercion, bribery or bullying that the Irish voted as they did. They people benefited from the first campaign and had an opportunity between the two campaigns, during which time there was much more heightened awareness of the issues at stake and much more debate about the Union, to weigh up the pros and cons and make an informed choice. Voter turnout was the highest for any referendum on our involvement in the European project to date, as stated by other Members. Clearly, people voted with a greater understanding of what was involved. The outrageous approach of Cóir in the campaign was very disingenuous. I will not name any individual but it is fair to identify the role of the organisation as an entity. They used religious objects and documents to suggest that the Catholic Church supported a 'No' vote. While there were divergent views among the Catholic bishops, they made it clear that there was nothing in the treaty to prevent a Catholic from voting either 'Yes' or 'No' and that the issue should be decided on the basis of political or economic arguments and not of ethics or morals. I found it difficult to receive documents, either in my home or in various churches, which contained religious imagery to make them look as if they came from the hierarchy and sought to create a negative opinion in the minds of readers. It was particularly disgusting to [622]see some groups linked to Cóir seeking to portray the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a tool of destruction and to play on the fears of vulnerable people, including people with a mental handicap, alcoholics or other marginalised people. These documents gave the impression that with the passage of the Lisbon treaty the Charter of Fundamental Rights would give powers to the State which it did not previously have and would limit the freedoms of people who were vulnerable or in difficult circumstances or that their children would be impacted upon or lose their liberty. That was particularly disgusting and I hope such tactics will never be used by any group in the future. The biggest difficulty of the 'Yes' campaign was in convincing people who did not have full information that the treaty had merits. It is difficult to provide information in a vacuum when people do not have the concrete knowledge of what the European project is about. If we learned anything between the first and second Lisbon referendum campaigns it was the importance of generating a greater level of debate on the European project in this House. This issue must be addressed. While I recognise the contribution of the Opposition in promoting a 'Yes' vote, the Fine Gael proposal to abolish the Seanad is a retrograde step. We have an opportunity, in reforming the Dáil and Seanad, to give a much greater level of access to European information and to further European debate within the Seanad. On the Order of Business today, the Labour Party and Fine Gael voted against the proposal that the Dáil sit in committee next week to discuss Committee Stage of the NAMA legislation. We need to develop committee debate rather than indulging in the tit-for-tat debate which we often have in the House and which does not reflect well on the real work of the Oireachtas. There is a notion that if we are not sitting in plenary session and throwing insults at each other across the floor that we are not doing our work. We would achieve a greater level of work more beneficial to the people and the State if we sat in committee, with public access, to debate issues of strategic national and international importance. This matter could be addressed by the Whips in terms of furthering the campaign for a greater level of debate on matters of European importance. I recognise the prominent role played by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and a number of Independents in debating and canvassing to communicate to the people the importance of passing the treaty. I recognise the tremendous efforts made by various groupings such as the IFA, the ICMSA, other farming organisations, trade unions and IBEC. I particularly recognise the work of two groups which represent civic society. They are We Belong, which was headed by Olivia Buckley, and Ireland for Europe, which was headed by Pat Cox and involved Brendan Halligan, Regina O’Connor and many others who gave their time voluntarily because they believed in the European project and in the importance of a 'Yes' vote. This coming together of people outside the political sphere was extremely welcome and should be harnessed in terms of how we continue to promote the European project. The efforts of the Government, of Government advisers and of national and international officials and civil servants must also be recognised. There was a difficult campaign in negotiating the legal guarantees with other member states. It was possible at an early stage to obtain declarations of intent but to obtain them in a legal format along with agreement that they would be attached as protocols was a well negotiated position. A debt of gratitude is due to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the civil servants and ambassadors in the member states who worked effectively on that campaign. Fine Gael and the Labour Party also used their contacts in their respective political groupings in the European Parliament and played a significant role, which should not go unnoticed. The legal guarantees on taxation, social and ethical issues and militarisation were hard fought but vitally important because research had identified them as issues which had forced the Irish people to vote as they did in the first referendum. The securing of those guarantees, together [623]with the solution of the representation issue of the loss of a Commissioner, ultimately brought the Irish people around to the belief that nothing in the Lisbon treaty would be harmful to the achievements of successive treaties or to the growth of the European Union. Deputy Costello made it clear that this referendum campaign was more difficult than others because the Irish perception of involvement in Europe had always been enhanced by a belief that there was something of monetary value in it for us. I believe we have moved beyond that. Our understanding has improved and we have matured as a member of the European Union. We now see ourselves, not as part of a hand-out culture but in a central role in guiding the future direction of the European Union to our benefit and that of others. We have the capacity to steer the European ship to our benefit and that of others in a collaborative way. The passage of the treaty referendum, difficult as it was, shows the maturity of the Irish people. It is important that the efforts of all concerned be recognised. Having brought European matters to such a level of understanding and awareness, it would be a pity to allow all of that to dissipate. We have come through an intensive round of discussions. After the defeat of the first referendum the Commissioner issue was resolved in December 2008 and this was followed by the build-up to the legal guarantees being agreed in June 2009 and the referendum campaign in October. There is now continuing talk about when the treaty will come into force. All of this keeps the European project in the people’s mind and in the media. We all hope that President Klaus of the Czech Republic will sign the treaty. My concern is that once that matter has been dealt with our discussion on Europe will fade away. That would be a great pity. It behoves us in this House to try to ensure that European matters remain at the forefront of the agenda so that as we evolve with Europe we do not have to go back to deal with the information deficit that existed prior to the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Through the co-operation of like-minded parties in this House there should be a capacity to do that. When the provisions of the Lisbon treaty are adopted a greater level of debate will be created in the Oireachtas whether through scrutiny or the subsidiarity checks. We must work more imaginatively to ensure that we retain that knowledge base and build on it as we move forward. The sub-committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs that was set up in the wake of the failure of the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty identified a number of considerable weaknesses in the European knowledge base. That is something we must address. That was largely as a result of our belief that we participated in Europe to gain something rather than for us to be part of the growth and development of Europe. We must work to try to develop a consciousness of the importance of the European Union. We will achieve that if we keep on debating and discussing that agenda in this House. We also must examine the education system and the curriculum as a means to achieve that. Unfortunately, there is not enough of a knowledge base or understanding of the origin and development of the European project for children in school as they progress through exams and become voters and progress through life. They are unaware of its foundation as a peace process and what the results of working together to the benefit of all can bring. Perhaps some of the reason for that relates to the fact that we often talk about the European project in some abstract form. We spend too much time talking about institutions and the relationships between them rather than looking at the much more concrete elements of Europe, what the issues are, what is the purpose of the existence of that collaborative environment that is the European Union and where and how we should progress with it. Ultimately, that must be our focus. There is also a requirement on the media. It is easy to put the blame on the media and I do not wish to do that. We must be imaginative in how we generate debate in the Oireachtas and if we are successful in that regard the media will report on it. It was interesting that through [624]some of the research we carried out in the sub-committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and, in particular, hearing the views of the media, it emerged that if issues are not debated in this House and are left to be debated in the context of the European Council, the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament or the Committee of the Regions or some such forum, they will not find their way into the common discussion fora in this country and will not be reported in the media. If we can succeed in having a greater level of debate and discussion we can achieve success in that regard. There is a considerable role for the national broadcaster, especially in view of its public service obligation, which is ultimately funded through the licence fee. There is a need to look more broadly at promoting our relationship and involvement with Europe and what the European project is all about. A magazine programme or documentary that is screened at 11. 30 p. m. or midnight is not helpful in that regard. Such programmes need to be much more mainstream and based around a weekly schedule. Ultimately, that should be the role of a public service broadcaster to look to areas that might not be commercial. It is clear that if it was commercial at the outset the public broadcaster would have the type of programmes that generate revenue through the commercial arm. For that reason there is a role for RTE. The broadcasts must be at a time that attracts an audience so as to develop a knowledge base of the European project in the community. I look forward to that discussion being dealt with through the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources. Unfortunately, the debate on Europe often centres too much on abstract issues and dealing with EU speak rather than focusing on how the European Union applies on an ongoing basis to the daily lives of people in this country. Unfortunately, in many instances the only time there is reference to the European Union is when something negative arises. Other speakers referred to that point, namely, that the Government and politicians take credit for the positive and seek to blame the Union for any negative consequence that might arise from directives and legislation. The Union needs to focus, either through the Commission or the Council of Ministers, on addressing the challenges facing Europe in a much more upfront and concrete way rather than talking about the back-end institutions, and how those issues relate to the lives of the citizens of the various member states. In terms of the financial and economic situation we need to consider the role of the Commission and the Union in developing policies on banking regulation. We need to discuss that issue more in this House. We need to look at the capacity of the Union to develop stimulus measures to reignite economic activity in the various member states. We also need to consider the co-ordination of efforts to resolve the banking problems. It is clear that a small country such as ours with a small national banking infrastructure cannot be expected to resolve those matters in isolation. People would begin to see and appreciate the benefit of the collaborative working between member states through the Commission and the various institutions of the Union, but that needs to be addressed more. A greater level of debate is required on the role of the European Central Bank, ECB, and in particular the support it is giving the State through the funding arrangement that will be in place for NAMA. The future development of the European Union must be communicated better. It is incumbent on us as Members of this House to use all the elements we have at our disposal. I again appeal to the Fine Gael Members present, whom I know have a great regard for the European Union and the way it works — that has been the case throughout the history of that party — to use the Seanad and the committees of this House to ensure there is a much greater level of debate, understanding and promotion of what that work is all about.",21/10/2009,30,666,667,House This issue must be addressed While I recognise the contribution of the Opposition in promoting a Yes vote the,Fine Gael,proposal to abolish the Seanad is a retrograde step We have an opportunity in reforming the Dáil and Seanad to,Fine Gael,4022207_1,,House This issue must be addressed While I recognise the contribution of the Opposition in promoting a Yes vote the Fine Gael proposal to abolish the Seanad is a retrograde step We have an opportunity in reforming the Dáil and Seanad to,House This issue must be addressed While I recognise the contribution of the Opposition in promoting a Yes vote the proposal to abolish the Seanad is a retrograde step We have an opportunity in reforming the Dáil and Seanad to,text614,2,2,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.218643267,0.005466082,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.777777778,0.723723724,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,0
3195980,5,8,65,Ceisteanna&ndash Questions. - MediaLab Europe Project.,04/04/2001,Mr. Bertie Ahern,Fianna Fáil,Dublin (Finglas),"I will look at those concerns and I will ask the Government liaison committee, the steering committee, to address them. We very much want to work with the universities. The universities had been concerned at the outset that they would have no involvement in these projects. However, there are already 11 approved projects with their involvement. The progress on the MediaLab Europe project is being carefully monitored by the Government liaison committee. Many Government Departments are represented on this committee, including the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. It is chaired by an official from my Department. Frameworks have been agreed with MediaLab Europe and these have been designed to enable the committee to monitor targets and objectives in relation to several critical issues. These include the attraction of high calibre research projects, researchers and students to MediaLab Europe and the commitment of MIT MediaLab to achieving this. I am told that these are people, projects and researchers which would not otherwise be in Ireland. In assessments I have read, such people have not been in Irish universities. Dr. Daniel O'Hare was very much a driving force, with the other universities. One of the university presidents who is a member of the group also states that and he has been involved in this for more than a decade. The commitment of MIT personnel, the recognition of time spent in MediaLab Europe by Irish and foreign students for degree granting purposes, the agreement of international sponsorship targets and a system of financial reporting will also be dealt with under the new frameworks. I will consider the other points raised but I wish to emphasise that up to 1998 there was little or no money invested in research and development. Now, under the national development plan, £560 million has been allocated to the technology foresight fund. That money will go to university projects, campus companies and the third level area. There are concerns about property speculation, as mentioned by Deputy Noonan. As with any new project of this type, property values in the area have increased. The Department of Finance has concerns about that but not for MediaLab Europe. MediaLab Europe is to receive £28 million over a four year period. That is scheduled. There is no difficulty with MediaLab Europe. It is the digital hub area and one with which the Department of Finance is concerned, as it is with the level of finance required to buy some of the buildings. The Department has a valid point in believing that the State should not buy up all the [54] buildings, but should simply provide enough to get the centre going. After that it should be enterprise driven.",04/04/2001,28,332,333,go to university projects campus companies and the third level area There are concerns about property speculation as mentioned by,Deputy Noonan,As with any new project of this type property values in the area have increased The Department of Finance has,Deputy Noonan,3195980_1,,go to university projects campus companies and the third level area There are concerns about property speculation as mentioned by Deputy Noonan As with any new project of this type property values in the area have increased The Department of Finance has,go to university projects campus companies and the third level area There are concerns about property speculation as mentioned by As with any new project of this type property values in the area have increased The Department of Finance has,text763,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.268793601,0.00671984,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.845845846,0.790790791,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
4048337,837,22,25,Order of Business.,17/12/2009,Mr. Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin,Sinn Féin,Cavan-Monaghan,"The Government has no respect for this Chamber, its Opposition voices or the normal debate that should be part and parcel of the democratic institution of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government is pressing ahead with guillotining four more Bills, following on everything it has rammed down the people’s throats these past few weeks. It is an outrageous approach. The House will rise today when community development projects across this State are in absolute turmoil because the Government has given notice they are to cease operation from the end of this month. That is a wonderful Christmas message for the people at the coalface of dealing with the most marginalised and needy in society. Not only has the Government cut social welfare payments and taken from public service workers, the buffer of community development projects, [998]built up over many years, and the supports they provide, which will be needed more than ever, will be undermined. Deputy Ó Snodaigh’s request under Standing Order 32 was giving voice to the countless organisations that will be affected up and down the country. What sort of message goes out that the Dáil will not debate the impact of these cuts. It is not about coming back on 13 January 2010. We should not be rising for Christmas but be back in business next week to deal with this urgent matter the Taoiseach does not want to address in the House.

1994258,400,8,36,"Financial Resolutions, 1981. - Financial Resolution No. 9: General (Resumed).",23/07/1981,Mr. Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald,Fianna Fáil,Cork Mid,"A lot has been written and a lot has been said over the past two days since the budget was introduced. The public will feel the impact of this budget in the coming weeks, particularly from 1 September next. I fear next [1218] winter will bring much disappointment and a grave set-back for our economy. Speakers during the past two days and on budget night have dealt with many important aspects of the budget. They have also dealt with the scenario which led up to the budget and the scene which was painted. On the opening night of the debate I referred to the balance of payments position and the independent economic forecasters who outlined the great improvement there would be in 1982. There has been a lot of talk about the budget deficit. I agree with my colleague who has just spoken that this budget was unnecessary and those measures were unnecessary at this time. This was done for pure political reasons and, as a consequence, all our people, but especially the young, will suffer during the coming winter. I want to dwell at length tonight on inflation and employment and to remind the Government, even at this late stage, how important those factors are. I want, especially, to remind the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party of their pre-election commitments. I want to remind the Independents that they now have the opportunity to say that they reject monetarism in this country and they reject inflationary policies such as this budget typifies. The budget is a grave set-back for our economy, which was nursed along through a very difficult world recession by Fianna Fail. Every act of ours was geared towards availing of the improvement in the world recession which we are told will come about in the second half of this year and with greater impact in 1982. All our efforts were designed to ensure that when we reached that recovery our economy would take off as a result of our policies. We are proud that we succeeded in bringing our economy through that very difficult world recession with far less damage to it than older and more developed states in the European Cummunity. The most serious aspect of the budget is the fuelling of inflation. The Government justified the budget by referring to the deficit and the level of borrowing, but they have completely ignored the impact of the budget on inflation. Surely, in any [1219] commentator's assessment, in any politicians assessment, that merits serious attention and also does its impact on our economy. Our inflation rate at present is about 17 per cent, which is for too high, but on the admission of the Minister for Finance — he said on Tuesday night that the budget would add 3 per cent to it — this will now go up to 20 per cent. We believe that with the knock-on effect of VAT and the ESB and CIE charges not included, it could be closer to 22 per cent or 23 per cent. I read an article in one of this evenings papers which vindicates the figure I am now talking about. This article was not written by a Fianna Fail person. Let us hear from the Government, the economists and all the commentators, who have been complaining about the gravity of our economic situation, how they defend the steep rise in inflation and how this can be good for the economy. The Taoiseach this morning spoke at some length about reducing inflation. He said the biggest and most permanent reduction in unemployment would be through a reduction in our inflation rate to EEC levels as quickly as posible. All of that is mere pious chant. By this budget he put up our inflation rate to almost record levels. If his reasoning of this morning is correct, this will lead to the biggest and most permanent increase in unemployment. I want to go back for a moment to the Fine Gael programme for the election, in which they said that rising prices and costs were destroying the livelihood of our people and increasing the cost of our products to a point where they could compete at home against imports. They also said that this, in turn, was causing employment to drop in Ireland and this inflation was largely caused by Government mismanagement. They also said that these cost increases had affected farm incomes most of all, because the prices secured for agricultural produce were set by the needs of our EEC partners. I want to remind the Minister for Finance, who, I am sure, was involved, and the whizz kids who prepared that document that that is from the Fine Gael programme. [1220] What about the Labour Party? What did they say before the election? They predicted the inflation rate would be 18 per cent for 1981, but that is before this budget. They said in their programme that the results of that 18 per cent inflation rate would be further inevitable cuts in living standards, a further loss of competitiveness and, therefore, more redundancies. Now the Labour Party in Government have added substantially to the inflation rate they forecast. The two Government parties have deliberately fuelled this inflation and I believe it to be only the first instalment because, as Deputy Connolly said, we shall have another hugh hike in expenditure taxes or indirect taxation to finance the income tax package next year. So much for the Taoiseach's broadcast to the nation last Friday when he said that the measures being taken next year to offset the taxes imposed now will help. He was indicating that whatever measures were being taken now would be shortlived and compensatory factors would accrue in January or whenever the budget was introduced. Of course that is not correct. Today at Question Time, during some of his evasive answering, the Minister admitted that the cost of introducing the promised packages would be substantial and obviously further indirect taxation will be brought in then. What about all the propaganda of the election promises and the deceitful and misleading advertisement of the cheque through the door almost next morning? Instead the people have got an additional average weekly budget of about £12 — so much for the £9. 60 through the door promise. Instead of the postman delivering it the VAT collector, the indirect taxation and the petrol pump will take away an average of £12 from the average weekly budget. The Tanaiste was very vocal in Opposition over the years about the necessity for centralised bargaining and for taking cognisance of industrial relations problems when Finance Ministers are introducing budgets. I wonder what comments the Tanaiste made on this budget when it was being introduced by the Minister [1221] for Finance. It would be interesting to know. Centralised bargaining has been a feature of our economy for more than a decade now. Introduced originally with the aid of Fianna Fáil in office, carried on by successive Governments, a new concept of it was reached in recent times with the advent of the national understanding. During Deputy Haughey's time as Taoiseach greater consultation took place with the social partners, the employers, the unions and the farm organisations, than ever before. I believe that is the way forward. With a young, growing population like ours that type of co-operation can only help. What effect will this budget have on bargaining of any sort, on centralised bargaining especially and above all on industrial relations? Perhaps it is true that the Government have already washed their hands of industrial relations problems. Today I was sorry to have to ask the particular Minister of State a supplementary question, because it was far removed from her portfolio, about the problems now facing social welfare beneficiaries. Two nights ago Deputy O'Malley said that shortly Dublin people would need photographs to remind them of what buses are like. Since the Government came in not one bus has moved in Dublin city and provincial services have been curtailed. I am sorry Deputy Byrne is not present but for three or four weeks he has been raising a problem affecting his people in north Dublin because of the non-functioning of lifts. I believe the Government have already washed their hands of industrial relations. I think the Minister for Labour and for the Public Service is already diving for cover — he carries much of my sympathy — because of the actions of the Minister for Finance now. His problems, great though they may be at present will only grow when the full impact of this severe budget is felt. I believe the Government are anxious to wash their hands of industrial relations, and this is understandable although I shall have some comments to make on this because I was often at the receiving end of the magical formulas that they could and would produce. [1222] There is no evidence that they have any answer other than the Minister saying that he intends to introduce legislation of which we do not yet know the details. By legislation alone they will not wipe out industrial relations problems there must be human concern and human concern is sadly lacking in the budget presented here. The measures introduced will hit living standards very severely. One must be concerned with comments being made already by employers and trade unions in the early lead-up to what should be renegotiation of a national understanding. I hope a national understanding will be achieved. Some may say that collective bargaining or centralised bargaining may have outlived its usefulness: I do not share that view I believe the alternatives are too dangerous and that a free-for-all would only harm industrial relations. The Government have an obligation to consider how much they are fuelling inflation. Certainly, this Government have set out to do it in a big way. A paltry £8 million is being given to agriculture. This is no compensation for the probable £80 million or £90 million being taken out of agriculture by the increases in VAT and taxes. People must realise that. The motor industry is being crucified. It is a hard word to use but the only one that will describe it. About five elements of motoring are severely affected by the budget. The employment content in the motor assembly industry is substantial as it is also in the case of accessories, tyres, etc. These will all suffer setbacks because of the enormity of the impositions in the budget. I understand we will now make our private vehicles easily the most expensive in Europe despite our heavy reliance on private transport especially in surburban and rural areas. What are the alternatives in surburban Dublin at present if one has no private transport when no public transport is available? I understand from today's papers that ESB charges are to go up by 25 per cent. Yesterday, I was amazed to hear Deputy Kelly, Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism commenting on the aids being given to industry by the dropping [1223] of the impost on hydrocarbon oil. It was very interesting. When one adds the ESB charge, the indirect taxation — petrol and VAT particularly in the case of industry — and telephone charges, the small relief being given on oil is of little significance in reducing costs when they are increased so substantially in other ways. Commentators have been extremely critical about the blow dealt to tourism. It was a shattering blow. We are all aware that in the early months of this year tourism was encouraging and promising but, due to unfortunate political events, it received a setback. Now, it has sustained this shattering blow and the consequences for all the different operations of tourism are very serious, employment being a very important feature of that industry. Although few details were given in the budget speech, we understand that investment by semi-State bodies is to be cut back by £135 million. We have some scepticism about this figure but if it is correct we wonder how it can be reconciled with the comments of the Tánaiste yesterday morning in this House when he said he was committed to expanding the State sector to provide the maximum number of jobs. One must doubt his sincerity. The budget curtails funds to semi-State bodies. The Tánaiste spoke at length about the National Development Corporation, to which we are committed. He spoke about pouring millions of pounds into it but he did not refer to the fact that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, was reducing the moneys available for other semi-State bodies. As a Government we supported State-sponsored bodies. We believe in using them also as employment vehicles. All of the bad news in the budget has been filtering through in bits and pieces. Today the Minister for the Environment announced that the 1 per cent mortgage interest subsidy, which we had introduced to keep down the cost of housing for young people, is to be abolished. The evening papers today estimate the extra cost to married couples as £20 per month. When one adds up all the extra costs one realises the figure is very high. [1224] The £4,000 grant for first-time house buyers is being restricted to married couples. In my view single working people are entitled to their own homes and the incentives we gave them in this connection also gave a significant boost to the construction industry. The parties who have for so long preached equality are discriminating now against single people who wish to buy their own homes. They will not be given the same facilities as are given to married couples. Some members of the other parties have been vocal during the years about equality and we wonder how they feel about this conservative decision taken by this conservative Government. Of course it will depress the building industry and will affect employment. If we take it that 22 per cent of house purchases are by single people, we can see that there will be a considerable reduction in the amount of building work. When one considers in addition the effect of the VAT increases on building materials it is obvious that there will be greater unemployment. In the past the Tánaiste had many comments to make on what he called our lack of attention to the building and construction industry. In his speech he referred to a huge growth in the unemployment figures by the end of 1981 as a result of our policies. I wonder if these decisions were designed to ensure that the figures mentioned by the Tánaiste will be reached? This afternoon the Minister for the Environment said local councils should be encouraged to raise their own forms of finance. Is this introducing rates by the back door? Is charging for garbage collection and other services and are the raffle and lotteries another way of introducing rates by the back door? We know what happened with regard to car tax. Will the people have to pay more for local services? While the Minister gave his personal support for the restoration of rates, his party said otherwise. However, it appears the Government are reneging on that promise also. By one means or another they will introduce rates. I listened with some interest to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism when he spoke about the public [1225] service. It was a very entertaining speech but it was not very enlightened or comprehensive and there was no content in what he said. He made many light-hearted points, but this is not the time or the place for that. These are difficult times and the measures taken by the Government will set back the progress of the nation. The Minister referred to the growth of 31,000 jobs in the public service but he did not say who was involved. Was he saying we should not have had more gardai, more prison officers, more teachers, more health services and people to work those services, was he saying we should not have had more people in the semi-State bodies? That is where the bulk of those posts arose. The Minister had a set on the public service for a long time when he was in Opposition and obviously he still has it in Government. On Tuesday night the leader of our party pointed out some sectors of the public service where he had personal experience of the commitment of the officials. I will not dwell on that except to say that the public servants seem to be a popular group to attack. Of course, people in the public service have not got the opportunity or the right to reply to the same extent that others have. There is now an embargo on further recruitment. I omitted earlier to mention the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Previous Governments neglected the area of communications but we saw the importance of this sector. More people were taken on, advanced technology was introduced, more telephones were installed and this rate of connection can be continued because of the excellent work of Deputy Reynolds when he was Minister. I hope this Government will not do anything to impede the great progress being made in this area. The Minister said that greater emphasis must be placed on the productive sector to give more jobs and I agree with that. However, our young population are entitled to improved services. I will give some statistics. In the Community Report for April 1981, Ireland is shown as having the lowest numbers of civil servants per head of the population of any country included in the report — 2 [1226] per cent of the population, compared with percentages ranging from 2. 2 to 3. 7. It is disappointing for fathers and mothers of families to be denied this opportunity for employment of their families. I heard the Minister say there would be ample opportunity in the civil service for young people, because of wastage, retirements, and so on. That is a disgraceful suggestion for any Member of this House to make. It is no substitute for useful public service recruitment. I agree there are some areas that are overstaffed and underworked, but there are many areas where there is need for recruitment. Emphasis has been placed on public service pay. It is a big change from the suggestions made by members of the Government when they were over here. Their comments then were very different. I should like to stress that the greatest increases in public service pay were as a result of national understandings and through recruitment. An efficient public service is needed and the provision of jobs must take priority. The Fianna Fáil Government gave tremendous sums of money to the IDA, one of our most successful State agencies, whom I must congratulate for past achievements and for what I know they will do in the future. At this moment we on this side do not know which Minister is in control of that agency. There is confusion even within the IDA about that. They are not sure whether it is the Tánaiste or Deputy Kelly who is in control. The Government should make this clear immediately because it is essential that this efficient and successful agency should not be confused in this way. We understand there is to be a curb on public sector pay. Meetings are to be held with the associations and unions in the service and the C and A scheme is to be discussed. The C and A has served this country well and any Government exercise on the lines contemplated would throw it back to 1975. I do not believe the public will condemn the Fianna Fáil Government for having recruited extra gardai, teachers, nurses and other health service employees. They were needed. [1227] Neither Labour nor Independent Deputies have given adequate explanations why they should allow this savage deflationary budget to go through tonight. This is their last chance to stop it. It is not in the interests of the ordinary working people or of so many of our young people who are looking for jobs. This is the type of deflationary policy which has done so much harm in an island not far from us where such policies have contributed to soaring unemployment and lack of jobs. Here it will have the same effect leading, perhaps, to a return to emigration, if that were available. Therefore, there is an obligation on those Deputies to examine carefully how they should vote in this, their final opportunity. Where are the food subsidies we were told by the Coalition parties would bring down the rate of inflation? Where are Labour's promised transport and fuel subsidies? The Labour Party promised all sorts of capital taxation, levies on banks and so on. Tonight those Deputies are being given an opportunity to vote down this budget which will be remembered for its contribution to higher unemployment and many other evils. At Question Time today the Minister for Finance referred to the Employment Guarantee Fund and I should like to put the record straight. It was introduced as part of the 1979 National Understanding and included contributions from employers and the Government. A tripartite committee was set up consisting of the social partners and the Government. In this years national understanding the Government contributed £10 million. Employers refused to contribute but after long and tedious negotiations we succeeded in getting a contribution form the employers towards vulnerable industries — Brussels did not allow us to contribute to high employment industries. We succeeded in having a programme prepared which would be acceptable to Brussels and to the employer organisations. That took considerable time. A sum of £10 million had to be provided, and because of technical problems legislation had to be put through the Oireachtas. Though [1228] the present Minister put it through it was ready and waiting for him. In the first national understanding a commitment was given to provide sports complexes and other facilities for the young. As I said earlier today, we should pay a tribute to Deputy Tunney for his efforts in this respect. He will be remembered for his great work in the Department of Education. However, just as the Government have reneged on their commitments to youth employment, they have also reneged on promises in regard to sports complexes, and no brandishing of files will excuse them for reneging on our young people, particularly when we see so much trouble, riots and so on, across the water. We were the first Government to make any worthwhile contribution to the development of youth facilities.",23/07/1981,22,884,885,two Government parties have deliberately fuelled this inflation and I believe it to be only the first instalment because as,Deputy Connolly,said we shall have another hugh hike in expenditure taxes or indirect taxation to finance the income tax package next,Deputy Connolly,1994258_4,,two Government parties have deliberately fuelled this inflation and I believe it to be only the first instalment because as Deputy Connolly said we shall have another hugh hike in expenditure taxes or indirect taxation to finance the income tax package next,two Government parties have deliberately fuelled this inflation and I believe it to be only the first instalment because as said we shall have another hugh hike in expenditure taxes or indirect taxation to finance the income tax package next,text619,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.252982213,-0.006324555,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.082082082,0.112112112,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
1926877,606,9,137,"Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1980: Second Stage (Resumed).",24/04/1980,Mr. Gerald L'Estrange,Fine Gael,Longford -Westmeath,"I shall quote from a Dáil debate when the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, was speaking on the Financial Statement. When they were in Opposition they promised the sun, moon and stars to the farmers and other sections of the community but when they came into power the opposite was the case. The present Taoiseach is trying to convince the people that the house that Jack built is in ruins and is falling down around our ears. We will not let him away with that because he is as much responsible for the last two and a half years as the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Molloy or any other Minister who got his walking papers very quickly when he became Taoiseach. Deputy Lynch, on 4 April 1974, was advocating [1993] extension of the relief on rates on private houses and agricultural land, that is if income tax was to be introduced for the farming community. He said that a good case could be made for derating agricultural land completely and he practically wept for the farmers. I shall quote from the Official Report, column 1515 of 4 April 1974 where he stated that: ...they indicate that rates are already a heavy imposition on many of them, especially the progressive ones. Therefore, there would be now a much stronger case to extend te Fianna Fáil policy of relieving homes, to relieving agricultural land from rates, if the incidence of income tax is going to bear more heavily on farmers as time goes on. It has been pointed out—and I think the point has been well taken—that farmers are the only producers whose means of production would be subject to income taxation. Another point which I think has been well taken is that about 50 per cent of their output, 50 per cent of their products, goes for export, whereas those in industrial production enjoy complete freedom of taxation from profits deriving from those industrial exports. This is a point the Minister will have to take into account—obviously he has not done so at this stage—in order to ensure that fair taxation will be applied across the board. What has happened since? One cannot blame farmers who turned against the Government in 1977—who, because they believed in equity, introduced taxation on large farmers—when they heard those statements that Fianna Fáil would relieve the farmer of his rates. We know that the rates in every county are about £5 higher than they were then and that instead of only farmers with £75 poor law valuations paying income tax a farmer from £40 upwards will pay. Under this Bill the subsidy which was available to them for many years has been abolished. Deputy Lynch went on to compare farming with industry. In industry if a man were to buy a tractor or machinery he would get a full allowance in his income [1994] tax but the farmer will only get one-third of the cost of a tractor or other implements if he purchases them for his land. Is that equity? Is that what the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, promised the farmers when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition? It is nothing new. They have broken their word very often in the past. He called at that time for fair taxation which would be applied across the board. This is not fair taxation but a heavy and savage imposition on small farmers. It also flies in the face of the main objectives of the Minister's statement in the budget. The three main objectives stated by him were, first, to introduce greater equity in the taxation system. Where is there greater equity in this? There is very little equity between the taxation on farmers and industry. A farmer with £39 valuation gets the full subsidy while a man with £1 more valuation, even if he has ten children, has to pay rates which are increased by almost £300 per year. Secondly, the objective was to protect and to improve the position of those on lower incomes. Surely a farmer with a £40 poor law valuation is on a low income. Is anything done to improve this position? There certainly is not. A farmer with a PLV of £40 is in the £50-£60 per week bracket. This is another savage attack on those unfortunate people. The third objective was to protect the source of economic growth. Small farmers were excellent producers in the past. During the last war they stood between us and hunger and want. They worked long hours to increase production when the call went out. For many years they were hewers of wood and drawers of water. There is no denying that from 1973 to 1977 or 1978 their incomes increased but last year was a disaster for many small farmers. Anybody who knows anything about farming will remember that between May and November last year cattle prices dropped from £50 per hundredweight to as low as £34 per hundredweight. Prices increased recently but unfortunately the Englishman or the factories are benefiting while the small farmer is not. [1995] The last election was fought on the platform that we were trying to tax farmers out of existence. We introduced farmer taxation. I lost votes because I had to defend our action. We believe in a fairer and more equitable distribution of wealth. In 1973 when we came into office 5 per cent of the population controlled 75 per cent of the wealth of the country and the other 95 per cent of the population had to make do with what was left. Our Coalition Minister was a hard-working intelligent fighter who went to EEC meetings and brought home the bacon. What happened since 1977? Is it a coincidence that since he left office farmers' prices have remained static while their overheads are increasing and the Government are piling more and more taxation on them. Before the last election I saw Deputy Clinton on television discussion programmes with Fianna Fáil Shadow Ministers for Agriculture. I remember the performances of some of those gentlemen and the promises they made. They claimed that all the taxes the Coalition had showered on the small farmers would be removed as soon as they got back into power. Has that happened? It has not. We were told farmers would be given more subsidies to increase further production, more assistance and less taxation. Those were the words used on a television programme. What happened to those promises? The opposite happened. We have more and more taxation of small farmers. The large farmers are reasonably well able to look after themselves but the small farmers are not. Since the subsidy was taken off lime the price has doubled. Because the subsidy was taken off artificial manure the price has increased by 70 per cent to 80 per cent since 1977. Subsidies have been taken off food. The small farmer has to buy food the same as everybody else. That is another increase in indirect taxation. Last year the 2 per cent levy was introduced. Small farmers who did not pay income tax were obliged to pay £10 or £12 on each beast sold. If they sold 10 cattle they had to pay from £60 to [1996] £80 tax. That was unfair and unjust as the Government realised later. When the Coalition left office a farmer with a PLV of £75 had to pay income tax. In 1978 Fianna Fáil reduced that figure to £60. Last year they said that would be reduced to £50. Did they keep their word? Not at all. They were not satisfied because in two years they had squandered the peoples' money, the country was in a mess and they had to get the money somewhere. This new form of taxation was introduced. Will it be down to £30 next year and the following year down to £20? The Drover in the Saturday Independent and many others, even Fianna Fáil backbenchers, people one would expect to speak out on behalf of the small farmers are silent. Do they see any ray of hope for the small farmer? The farmer with a PLV of £40 will pay at least £6 extra in rates and taxation as I will explain in detail later. Take the counties I represented so far—I do not know what will happen today when we see the new constituency boundaries. This year a County Westmeath farmer with a PLV of £60 will pay £571. 80 rates. Had the subsidy remained his rates would be £304. 96. He is paying an extra £266. 84. A farmer with a PLV of £50 is paying £476 rates this year, losing a relief of £238. A farmer with a PLV of £40 is paying £381 this year. Had the subsidy been allowed his rates would be £171. 54. Because of the actions of the Government who promised to reduce farmer taxation and who always claimed that the small farmer who for many years supported Fianna Fáil, was the backbone of this country, this farmer's rates have been increased from £171. 54 to £381. 20. He is paying £209 more. Is that fair? Where is the equity, where is the justice? The number of holdings affected in Westmeath is 928 and the reduction in the agricultural grant this year is an average of £217,000. Would you call this a relief Bill for farmers? It is certainly a relief Bill for the Department because they are saving £217,000 in Westmeath alone. So much for the [1997] Fianna Fáil Government who have always claimed they represent the small farmers of Ireland. But could one expect anything else? We can remember a few years ago when the small farmers, from Cork to Donegal, marched to Dublin to protest against their low standard of living. They demonstrated peacefully outside Leinster House and they were arrested. When the present Taoiseach was Minister for Agriculture he left them sitting on the steps in Merrion Street, passed them by and refused to meet them. I admit he has changed since then. He seems to be all things to all men. He is trying to get all the votes to keep him there as leader of his party. In County Longford the rate this year is £12. 67 in the £. In 1979 it was £11. 52 and the gross rate of a farmer with a £41 PLV was £161. 68. With the cut in the subsidy that man's rates will amount to £418 this year, an increase of £256. 32 but we must add to that the 10 per cent increase in rates. This means that that farmer will be paying roughly £460 in rates this year, an increase of £299. Where is the equity there? A single farmer with a PLV of £39. 99 will pay about £170 in rates because he will enjoy the subsidy, but his brother or neighbour who lives next door, with ten children and 2p more PLV, bringing it up to £40. 1, will pay £460 in rates. Where is the equity in that? This is a Government who spoke about cherishing all the children of the nation equally, about representing the small farmers of Ireland. They are misrepresenting and crucifying them. Take a farmer with a £50 PLV in Longford. In 1979 his rates were £188. This year without the subsidy his rates would be £576, but we have to add the 10 per cent increase in rates which means that he will be paying £316 more in rates, roughly £6 per week extra taxation. According to the farm management survey, the income of that farmer would be £3,078 in 1979 figures, less than £60 per week, less than a road worker receives, less than a large farmer pays to his agricultural labourer. As a result of this Bill that man will be paying £316 a [1998] year more in 1980, reducing his income from £60 to £54 per week. We must add to that the drop in cattle prices and the projected reduction in the price of barley. We must also take into account the increased cost of living and the increase in the price of feeding stuffs. All this will bring his income down to less than £46 a week. Is that justice or equity or fair play? How do the Government expect any such farmer to survive let alone use initiative or have confidence? Many farmers in Longford are trying to get work. They will be competing with workless in the towns for any jobs there may be going in factories or on the road. The Government are piling up more and more trouble for themselves. In North Longford there is a lot of bad land and in south Longford farms are subject to flooding by the Shannon for many months. Take a farmer there with a PLV of £59. In 1979 his rates were £361. This year that rate will be £678, a difference of approximately £300, but we must add the 10 per cent increase in the rates and we find that such a farmer will be paying £350 more this year. In County Longford there are 223 farmers with a PLV of between £40 and £50 and 137 between £50 and £60—360 farmers who are being caught by this Bill. They did not expect this kind of treatment following the promises made in the manifesto. They were fooled in 1977 by announcements on radio and TV which told them that Fianna Fáil would reduce their taxation. Many of them voted for Fianna Fáil. The people are slowly but surely finding them out and are waiting for the day when they will wreak their vengeance on a Government which so deliberately misled them to get back to enjoy for themselves, not for the rest of the country, the fruits of office. Those 360 extra farmers are caught with this extra burden of increased prices. What the farmer has to sell is static. As I said earlier on, the price of cattle dropped from £50 a hundredweight down to £34 and the cost of living went up due to the higher prices than in 1977. The question must be posed as to how this treatment [1999] of the small to medium sized farmer—because that is what those who are now caught in the net are—fits in with the three objectives stated by the Minister for Finance in his budget. Does it introduce equity? Does it improve the position of those on lower income? Does it protect a source of economic progress? The answer must be no, no, no, to the three questions. The country today is certainly in a mess of the Government's own making because of their manifesto of 1977 to get into office, because of their promises to reduce, instead of increase, taxation. The Government at that time gave the impression that everything was up for grabs. They abolished wealth tax and rates on houses and castles. A millionaire could have a home on an island, a house in the city and another house in Cork, Donegal or other parts of the country. Those are all free of rates. The speculator in the city could have five, ten, 15, 20 houses let out to tenants and those are all free of rates. Where is the justice and where is the equity there, when a small farmer living at the end of a boreen with no amenities of any description with potholes that you could be lost in cannot get money from the county council even to make a road into his house? As somebody said, GNP now means gross national potholes and they are not too far out. Westmeath and Longford County Councils cannot make any improvements to the roads. The men they have have to be kept busy patching the roads and fixing up the potholes.",24/04/1980,21,1325,1326,30 next year and the following year down to 20 The Drover in the Saturday Independent and many others even,Fianna Fáil,backbenchers people one would expect to speak out on behalf of the small farmers are silent Do they see any,Fianna Fáil,1926877_14,,30 next year and the following year down to 20 The Drover in the Saturday Independent and many others even Fianna Fáil backbenchers people one would expect to speak out on behalf of the small farmers are silent Do they see any,30 next year and the following year down to 20 The Drover in the Saturday Independent and many others even backbenchers people one would expect to speak out on behalf of the small farmers are silent Do they see any,text109,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.22710999,0.00567775,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.798798799,0.740740741,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,0
1024525,778,8,145,"Committee on Finance. - Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1959—Committee Stage (Resumed).",23/03/1960,Mr. Michael Moran,Fianna Fáil,Mayo South,"I assure you, Sir, that I propose to make this very relevant to the hours set out in this Bill inasmuch as they are the hours, I believe, which are most likely to command general public support. On that proposition, unless we get a measure from this House which will command general public support the law will not be enforceable. It has been alleged by the protagonists of restricted hours that extended hours will lead to greater drunkenness. At page 3 the 1925 Commission reported:— The right to interfere with the drunkard is the right to interfere with a public nuisance, but this right does not entitle the law to prohibit or unduly restrict the satisfaction of a natural and legitimate appetite by reasonable and moderate men who do not abuse their rights. The ideal to be aimed at therefore seems to us to be a system of law which will secure good order and remove the abuses [1035] connected with the consumption of an article, the use of which may be voluntarily abandoned, but cannot be forceably suppressed. It is, moreover, abundantly clear from all human and legislative experience that there are limits to the compulsory suppression of drinking, and that when carried beyond those limits it defeats its own object by tending to promote more injurious forms of excess as well as evasion of the law by common consent. These are the principles which have guided us in our proceedings and underlie the recommendations of this Report. In short, we are satisfied that it is necessary to enforce reasonable restrictions on the trade in intoxicating liquor and that these restrictions must be based upon consideration for the necessities of public order, public health and public safety. I think, that we have proved what that Commission stated in its report. I was in this House when the former licensing legislation went through. On that occasion, too, there was much talk of a free vote of the House and there was a free vote allowed on many amendments to that legislation. The result was that instead of the Bill which was introduced and which would have been workable had it emerged as it was introduced, we had different views expressed by different Deputies and we ended up with legislation which was neither fish, flesh nor good red herring. That legislation has proved to be entirely unenforceable, and I think that is known to every Deputy who represents a rural area. I have said that in my view that on this occasion we should be very careful and that we should endeavour, in so far as we can, to put a workable Bill on the Statute Book. Deputy Palmer's amendment is not, to my mind, of very grave importance to rural Ireland. There is the view, I know, that we should strive to have summer time, as the country people call it, extended further in this Bill. There is a distinction in the existing laws between closing time during summer time and during the rest of [1036] the year. At the moment closing time is 10. 30 p. m. in summer time and 10 p. m. for the rest of the year. Summer time lasts from the third Sunday in April to the first Sunday in October although I am told that it begins earlier this year because the third Sunday in April is Easter Sunday. We came to the conclusion that the distinction between summer time and winter time was not the correct one to make. Deputy Palmer would like to have these hours in existence for the month of May and he made the case on behalf of rural Ireland on that issue. Taking one thing with the other, I think that there is not the same necessity for the extended time in the month of May that there is the following months. If we could get from the House as much agreement as possible on this matter and if we could get some kind of uniform hours I think we would make some progress. I think it is demonstrably true that the people who sat on this Commission representing the Total Abstinence Association accepted the Majority Report of the Commission for the reason that they felt that in our circumstances it was the most likely one to be enforceable and accepted by all our people. I am quite sure that they also had in mind that earlier closing hours would not be acceptable and that they would lead to other abuses, the abuses which we all know are taking place. It was for the purpose of getting a workable measure that these men subscribed to the majority view of the Commission. It was not because they liked it but because being reasonable men they felt it to be the most workable solution and the most reasonable one in all our circumstances. Some of the Deputies on the opposite benches have been extolling the view that it would be a good thing for the Government to have a free vote on this issue. I take the opposite view and I take it very seriously. I am sorry that the Opposition groups have decided not to take a majority decision representing the majority view of each Party. I think that our work as far as this Bill is concerned would be much easier if they had followed [1037] the usual practice. I would like to point out to Deputies how difficult it is for the Government and for anyone listening to the debate to get what might be described as a common denominator of the majority view of this House. If we take the amendments which have been tabled and which we are now discussing we have Deputy Cosgrave in his proposals asking that the closing hours in the country should be 11. 30 p. m. from June to September and 11 p. m. from October to May. For the city he asks that the hours should be 11 p. m. from June to September and 10. 30 p. m. from October to May. Deputy Ryan of the same Party tables an amendment expressing the view that in the country the hours should be 11. 30 p. m. from May to September and 11 p. m. from October to May but in the city he wants 11 o'clock from June to September and 10. 30 p. m. from October to May. Deputy Manley, again from the same Party, has an amendment that the closing hours should be 10. 30 p. m. all the year round. Deputy Rooney, also from Fine Gael, advocates 11. 30 p. m. in the country throughout the whole year and he wants 11. 30 p. m. in the city from June to September and 11 p. m. from October to May. If we take the other Parties, we have Deputy Norton of the Labour Party whose view is that closing hours should be 10. 30 p. m. all the year round while Deputy Larkin wants 10. 30 p. m. in rural areas from June to September and 10 o'clock from October to May.

2211149,822,8,132,Dooge Committee Report on European Union: Statements (Resumed).,26/06/1985,Mr. Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan,Fianna Fáil,Limerick West,"(Limerick West): If that is [2093] what greater European unity means, we must object to it. As the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Agriculture, I welcome the efforts of the adhoc committee to improve the decision making process in the Council. Year after year, Irish farmers have suffered great losses due to the failure of the Community's agricultural Ministers to reach decisions. Anything which speeds up the process of decision making would be welcome but I am doubtful if it is in our interests that the new general principle should be adopted whereby decisions would be made on a qualified or simple majority. For example, if this had been in operation when the milk super-levy was first threatened, the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, would have been powerless to prevent its immediate implementation. Equally, of course, Britain would have been unable to pursue its stubborn stance on Community finances which paralysed decision making in Europe for some time. Perhaps the qualifications in the report regarding a member state's very important interest would solve the problem, but to do so, those very important interests would have to be known and agreed to in advance. Otherwise, any member state could call a very important interest on any issue and slow up the decision making process once again. A workable method of agreement regarding what constitutes a very important interest would be essential if these proposals are to work. The proposal to speed up the decision making process is the only real and necessary one in the whole report. Pious aspirations remain just that but the problem of decision making will have to be tackled. It is ironic that it would probably take the Council a very long time to decide on new procedures in regard to decision making but that is the way of the European Community. Perhaps that is why there are 14 million people unemployed in an economic community which possesses all the means of eliminating unemployment. High minded Principles are all [2094] very well for the Eurocrats but unemployed people do not care about European unity if they cannot get a job.

992915,318,9,152,"An Bille um an Tr&iacute &uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1958—An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il). Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958—Committee Stage (Resumed).",20/01/1959,Mr. James M. Dillon,Fine Gael,Monaghan,"Fianna Fáil have a pathetic belief in the power of the falsehood oft repeated. They have sought to say that in 1947 I repudiated the whole principle of P. R. Usually, I do not bother to correct the false-holds of Fianna Fáil they are too numerous and noisome to trouble with but for the record it may be well to say in the context of this discussion that, in 1947, I pointed out that those who hoped to operate the system of P. R. in its fullest application were living in a Utopian world of illusion, founding their system on the assumption that something like Fianna Fáil could not happen, while those of us who know the imperfect world in which we live are only too conscious of the fact that in an imperfect system something like Fianna Fáil does sometimes happen. When they got the power in 1935 by [827] the Electoral Act of that year, they went as far as they dare to gut the whole principle of the multiple constituency upon which the ideal form of P. R. is founded and they reduced all the constituencies in Ireland from their seven and five seat status— and, in some cases, nine seat status—in which P. R. functions perfectly, to three seat constituencies, in order to ensure in so far as they could, that wherever they secured a bare majority of the votes in any area, their bare majority would secure to Fianna Fáil two seats, leaving for the rest of the voters one seat. In that imperfect form, P. R., in my judgment, had ceased to function and was merely a travesty of the original system. Therefore, those who had hoped to see P. R. function on the basis of the multi-seat constituency of nine, seven or five seats were Utopian, unfitted for the practical side of life and such persons trespassed on the dangerous field of public life at their peril and very often at the peril of their neighbours. I went on to say that in the imperfect world in which we live, it seemed to me that the single seat constituency with the transferable vote represented the nearest approach we could get to a fair record of the people's preference and a true choice of the individuals whom the people wanted to represent them in this, the sovereign Parliament of Ireland. Anyone who wishes to trouble himself to refer back to the text—and the full text—of what I said in the discussion of the Electoral Act of 1947 will find that that is a faithful representation of the contention I then made. Now, all this that is proceeding here to-day is undertaken by Fianna Fáil in the cause of stability. I think we are entitled to ask them what they mean by stability. In the past 35 years, we have had three Prime Ministers in Ireland. Is there any other democracy in the world which can claim a like measure of stability? Manifestly, there is not but 'stability' has ceased to mean in the ranks of Fianna Fáil what ordinary men mean by stability. [828] For Fianna Fáil stability is rapidly coming to mean that in this country anything which reveals the possibility of any Government other than a Fianna Fáil Government functioning here is self-evidently unstable and requiring amendment so that an alternative to Fianna Fáil never can emerge again. I warn that we are travelling the road which may well precipitate this country into disaster. The Fianna Fáil spokesmen in this debate have already declared quite openly that they want to see wiped out of this House, where they say there is no longer room for them, the Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and the Independents and the Minister for Local Government has declared that he is inspired by the pious hope that the principal Opposition Party will be wiped out, too. Despite his denials, he is convicted publicly of falsehood because although he protests that he never used certain words, every independent testimony is that he did use them and yet with unblushing effrontery, he comes into the House and faces us all, convicted publicly of falsehood and wholly unable to utter a word to discharge himself from an indictment that no honourable man should bear in silence. The burden of that falsehood is that he revealed before the world the secret hopes of his own colleagues and that his leader condemned him for letting the cat out of the bag. And so we are moving along this profligate road. We began in the first sub-section by reducing minorities to virtual impotence in the first sub-section, the purpose of the decision of this House was to render the votes of minorities ineffective. The purpose of this sub-section is to create a situation in which their votes will not be counted at all—and that is political dictatorship run mad. Some of us listened to the Minister for Defence to-day. I freely concede that he was floundering about in a brief that had been furnished to him and that he himself did not understand. Despite his repeated reference to the document with which he was furnished when he came in here, much of what he said was incoherent. In so far as [829] sense could be made out of what he was saying, he wanted to communicate to the House his belief that the idea that anyone should be allowed to choose between the worst and the second worst was an outrage on freedom and justice. I do not think he is an inexperienced politician: I think he was born and bred in the atmosphere of politics. I do not give him the excuse of saying that he is an unsophisticated entrant in this House. Much of his activities since he came in here demonstrate the fact that he is fully sophisticated in the worst practices of Fianna Fáil politics. The truth is that he does not realise the magnitude of the outrage that his contentions make on every standard of public decency. If he had learned as much as he ought to know about this troubled world in which we live, he would have learned long ere now that 'public life in any free society is not always a choice between the best and the second best, but all too often a choice between the worst and the second worst', in the immortal words of the late Tom Kettle. What is wrong in leaving a man free in this country to say: 'I like Fine Gael best and, if I could have it, I would have them but I will have anyone rather than Fianna Fáil'? Is there anything wrong in leaving the free voter in this country say: 'From the horrors of Fianna Fáil, good Lord deliver me', and using his vote to that end? Is there anything wrong in a free man in this society saying: 'I will vote Labour as my first preference, but if I cannot secure the election of a Labour candidate, then I prefer a Fine Gael candidate to a Fianna Fáil candidate'? Is that wrong? Does that shock the disinterested and lofty sentiments of Fianna Fáil? I know that Fianna Fáil find it hard to imagine that for any vacancy, Presidential, Bord na gCon, Parliament, or anywhere else there is a job to be got, they cannot find some Fianna Fáil nominee who would be glad to get it. I know it never occurs to Fianna Fáil that, so long as there is a Fianna Fáil hack available to push into any vacancy, anybody else should be considered.",20/01/1959,16,106,107,its fullest application were living in a Utopian world of illusion founding their system on the assumption that something like,Fianna Fáil,could not happen while those of us who know the imperfect world in which we live are only too conscious,Fianna Fáil,992915_3,,its fullest application were living in a Utopian world of illusion founding their system on the assumption that something like Fianna Fáil could not happen while those of us who know the imperfect world in which we live are only too conscious,its fullest application were living in a Utopian world of illusion founding their system on the assumption that something like could not happen while those of us who know the imperfect world in which we live are only too conscious,text842,3,1,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-0.84729786,-0.021182447,-0.071151247,-0.001778781,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.153153153,0.163163163,0.25025025,0.261261261,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

The Minister cannot introduce that proposal under EU law by January 2009. Time will tell but industry is important. Labour is the party for people’s jobs — traditionally we are not the party for industry but even we recognise all stakeholders should be consulted, including the industry. This proposal should have been examined by the taxation commission. If the Minister was serious about reducing carbon emissions in the budget, he would have ensured major public transport projects were fast-tracked. 7 o’clock The easiest project to undertake is investment in Dublin Bus. I attended a meeting as a councillor in 1999 or 2000 at which the DTO made a presentation on its Platform for Change. Its strategy was to invest in Dublin Bus as a short-term measure followed by investment in the existing rail infrastructure and then the Luas and metro. However, eight years later, none of this has been done. Dublin Bus is still being held back in the provision of appropriate bus services throughout the city. This comes down to ideology. The Government does not want to invest in Dublin Bus, provide additional buses and encourage people out of their cars. It has dithered about public transport. Transport 21, environmental impact assessments and so on are not needed to ensure something is done about Dublin Bus. The Minister should order the buses and commission them. The Labour Party has proposed the subsidising of fares and the introduction of a €1 bus fare. Such an initiative would have been given priority if the Green Party and its Government partners were serious about tackling transport emissions. This legislation will ensure a sustained increase in these emissions. According to the Irish Independent over Christmas, it is predicted such emissions will be 260% above 1990 levels by 2016 if something is not done about public transport. This is about ideology. The Minister does not need to introduce a Dublin transport authority Bill or to get Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and the RPA together to agree anything. He should begin with Dublin Bus and give the company the buses it was promised years ago.

2693320,1044,8,25,Private Members' Business. - Care of the Elderly: Motion (Resumed).,08/12/1993,Mr. Brendan Smith,Fianna Fáil,Cavan-Monaghan,"I thank previous speakers for sharing their time with me. At the outset I wish to compliment Deputy O'Hanlon on his initiative, while Minister for Health, in introducing the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. I know from speaking with people in the nursing homes association and health board officials, particularly in my own health board area, that he was most amenable to their proposals and suggestions. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion tabled by the Minister for Health. It is opportune as the European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations draws to a close. It is appropriate for this House to look back on the series of special initiatives which the Government has taken during the past 12 months, particularly in the area of social welfare. We in Ireland have gained a reputation throughout Europe for the imaginative and caring way in which we look after our old folk. Their position and status in our community stems directly from the respect which Irish people have always held for older and retired people. In particular, Fianna Fáil has always recognised their immeasurable contribution to the economic and social life of this country. In Government Fianna Fáil will continue to combine imagination with concern to ensure that our policies meet their needs. We have done so in the firm belief that after a lifetime of service to the nation, elderly people should be able to retire [2036] with the dignity they deserve. Fianna Fáil is firmly committed in the Programme for a Partnership Government to at least maintain the real value of social welfare payments and to protect the position of pensioners. I am confident that this Government will honour that commitment and improve the situation where possible. I would like to refer specifically to the carer's allowance. This is one of the most important initiatives taken and Deputy Dr. Woods, as Minister for Social Welfare, over a number of years is worthy of commendation for his work in introducing this scheme. There are thousands of people all over the country, many of whom are women, who are looking after elderly and incapacitated relatives at home. That scheme was introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare, to provide a secure income for those carers who have no independent income of their own. I know the Minister would like to see more flexibility with regard to the income criteria and the time conditions of the scheme. We all hope it will be possible during the coming years to improve that scheme. However, we must realise that some £10 million is being provided for the scheme and about 5,000 carers are in receipt of a regular weekly payment. I am disappointed that some politicians in this House and outside have tried continuously to undermine the carer's allowance since it was first launched. The reality is that £10 million per year is being provided where it was not provided previously. Almost 5,000 carers throughout the country are receiving a payment which they did not receive previously. We are giving tangible financial recognition to the work of carers on low incomes, who unselfishly, day in and day out, care for elderly and incapacitated social welfare pensioners. The reality is that the Government this year increased that allowance by almost 12 per cent, bringing the maximum payment to £59. 20 per week. Earlier in the year the Minister for Social Welare, introduced the respite care trust fund. I would hope that that [2037] fund can be increased and more scope given to it. Nobody can doubt the commitment of this Government and particularly the commitment of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, or their determination to improve housing conditions throughout the country. The improvements mentioned by the Minister of State last night are worthwhile, but much more is needed. I appeal to the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and to the Minister for the Environment to plan more effectively and to provide a better spread of housing units for the elderly. Those units should be provided in all our villages. There should be a mix of housing to ensure that all age groups are caterd for within the schemes. I appeal to the Minister for Health to ensure that more beds are made available in what may be termed district hospitals for people who no longer need an acute hospital bed but have no relative to return home to.

3462215,106,14,88,Adjournment Debate - School Closures.,06/05/2004,Mr. Tommy Broughan,The Labour Party,Dublin North-East,"A few weeks ago the parents of Foxfield St. John’s parish and St. Benedict’s parish, Kilbarrack, Dublin 5, were 'devastated and distraught' in the words of one of the sixth year pupils at the sudden announcement of the closure of Greendale community school by the trustees, the Holy Faith Order, the Jesuit Order and the City of Dublin Vocational Education [108]Committee. The closure announcement took place without consultation with the local community, Kilbarrack and District Residents Association, the Northside Partnership, Foxfield St. John’s parish, St. Benedict’s parish, west or east Kilbarrack, the parents of the 200 plus students or staff. A few years ago we tried to establish a regional educational council to look at numbers and needs of educational provision in the various districts around Ireland. Unfortunately when the then Minister for Education and Science, Niamh Bhreathnach, and our party went out of Government that proposal was abandoned. There was a clear need for some kind of regional educational planning structure. Greendale community college has been a wonderful community resource for the two Kilbarrack parishes and surrounding districts of Raheny, Kilbarrack and mid-Sutton. The school was founded in 1975 and with a peak enrolment of 950 students in the early 1980s made a powerful contribution towards the education of generations of children from the Kilbarrack area. When I meet many of my constituents in the public and private sector it is striking how many of them are proud of the wonderful education they received from the principal Antóin Carroll. The staff of Greendale community college created a strong learning atmosphere and included such famous people as the great Dublin writer, Roddy Doyle, the playwright, Paul Mercier, and one of the immortal members of Dublin GAA teams, the great Brian Mullins. That staff, lead by an tUasal Antóin Carroll, made a very significant contribution to a low-income area and one that was educationally deprived up to the mid-1970s. With the maturing of this area, second-level numbers in the college had fallen to the current 220 students with a staff of 34 teachers. As pointed out on the day of the announcement, over 1,000 adult students use the Greendale campus. Over the years, the school had an important link to Trinity College, Dublin, for adults going on to second chance and university education. This is the second body blow my constituency has received in recent months. A couple of months earlier we heard of the proposed closure by the Oblate Order of the famous Belcamp College in north Coolock from where the great Henry Grattan came, and which for over 100 years had turned out generations of distinguished Dublin men, and provided an important resource for areas which had been educationally deprived. It also has a large and happily settled Traveller community whose education was of particular interest to Belcamp College. Throughout its 30 year history, Greendale community school has been a readily available and pleasant facility for all community groups, sports clubs, Naomh Barróg GAA Club, Kilbarrack United, Kilbarrack and District Residents Association and all the other residents [109]associations, sports bodies and communities of Kilbarrack and district. It is regrettable there was no consultation with any of those bodies, committees, myself or any of the other public representatives, one of whom is the former Minister for Education and Science, my colleague, Deputy Woods. I call on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to re-examine all the reports on Greendale community school. I call on the VEC and the two religious orders concerned to review this decision urgently to ensure we do not lose a key community resource for the parish of Kilbarrack and have it replaced, as the district fears, with a high-rise monstrosity which would be to the advantage of developers and not the people of the area. 5 o’clock",06/05/2004,29,554,555,or any of the other public representatives one of whom is the former Minister for Education and Science my colleague,Deputy Woods,I call on the Minister for Education and Science Deputy Noel Dempsey to re-examine all the reports on Greendale community,Deputy Woods,3462215_1,,or any of the other public representatives one of whom is the former Minister for Education and Science my colleague Deputy Woods I call on the Minister for Education and Science Deputy Noel Dempsey to re-examine all the reports on Greendale community,or any of the other public representatives one of whom is the former Minister for Education and Science my colleague I call on the Minister for Education and Science Deputy Noel Dempsey to re-examine all the reports on Greendale community,text431,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.093704257,0.002342606,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.575575576,0.551551552,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

Davern,Fianna Fáil,Tipperary South,"They stated that it was not the duty of the Government to provide work for the unemployed, and that was a very few years ago, and men died of hunger and women died of hunger and men were driven into the asylums, the mental homes of this country, because of the policy of Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and the rest of the gang who were then Ministers with him. Things have changed since and with the Fianna Fáil Government coming into power our people appreciated and fully realised what the workers went through during that ten years of the Fine Gael Government. You did not have unemployment assistance at all and when a man was starving he had to go to the home assistance officer with his hat in his hand begging for a few shillings to try to keep body and soul together. The cap-lifting age is gone. We abolished that in 1932 and 1933.

I compliment Deputy Spring on having brought forward this Bill for the purposes of enabling this discussion to take place in a formal way during Private Members' time. Before dealing with the merits or the demerits of the Bill I should like to take up a couple of points raised by Deputy Rabbitte. He questioned the degree to which the Minister for Justice is committed to reform on the basis that he has not accepted this Bill as quickly as Deputy Rabbitte would have liked him to. I think the presumption being made is that this Bill which simply incorporates to a large extent the English precedent in section 17 of the relevant Criminal Justice Act into our legislation forgets that there is a very fundamental difference in our legal system, that is, the existence of a written Constitution. Set out in the Constitution is a separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary and the role [2290] of the courts, which is set out in the relevant Articles. This makes the issues which are to be dealt with more difficult and complex in that it has to be properly ensured that a negation of justice, which is synonymous with the Guildford Four case, will not occur in this jurisdiction. In other words, he is not comparing like with like when he refers to the English and Irish legal systems. Under our Constitution certain rights are guaranteed to the citizen and they are based on the constitutional case law of the High Court and the Supreme Court. To say that our refusal to accept the Bill is an indication of our lack of reforming zeal scantily brushes over the real difference that exists between the two systems.",29/11/1989,26,33,34,us an opportunity to deal with some of the questions which were raised by the Guildford Four case I compliment,Deputy Spring,on having brought forward this Bill for the purposes of enabling this discussion to take place in a formal way,Deputy Spring,2442321_1,,us an opportunity to deal with some of the questions which were raised by the Guildford Four case I compliment Deputy Spring on having brought forward this Bill for the purposes of enabling this discussion to take place in a formal way,us an opportunity to deal with some of the questions which were raised by the Guildford Four case I compliment on having brought forward this Bill for the purposes of enabling this discussion to take place in a formal way,text631,0,3,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.945910149,0.048647754,0.355756237,0.008893906,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.937937938,0.884884885,0.906906907,0.857857858,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0

1623933,608,8,123,"Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973: Committee Stage (Resumed).",20/03/1974,Mr. Patrick J. Lalor,Fianna Fáil,Laoighis-Offaly,"I find it extremely difficult to be satisfied that we are getting across to the Minister the point and the purpose of our amendment because of the closed door attitude the Minister is adopting to it. Previously I endeavoured to show quite clearly why it is so necessary to add the words in our amendment to the section. Deputy Andrews has clearly indicated that the section would be more comprehensive and more clear if the proposed words were added to it. It appears that the Minister is quite adamant in refusing to give specific reasons for not accepting it. He said he would be accused of repetition if he gave specific reasons. I read the Official Report of the debate on this amendment and at no stage did the Minister make any genuine effort to give specific reasons for not accepting the amendment. He said that section 7 is exactly the same as section 7 of the 1969 Act and that, if it was good enough then, it should be good enough now. According to the Press, the First Stage of a Bill will be introduced in this House tomorrow morning by the Government because it has been found by the Supreme Court that a Bill introduced and passed by the Fianna Fáil Government in the 1930s is defective. We never questioned that Bill before. Had the Minister or his colleagues been introducing a similar Bill and using a section from the 1936 or 1937 Act and endeavouring to sell it to the House on the basis that: 'It was good enough before you people introduced it at that time and now you are finding fault with it', we would not have known it was defective. The Minister's colleagues have said that certain Acts on the Statute Book need to be updated. We are endeavouring to update this section. So far no fault has been found with the operation of section 7 of the 1969 Act. Because of that the Minister says: 'It was good enough for you people before. It was good enough over the past four or five years and it is still good enough.' That type of argument is not sufficient, especially in view of the fact that the Minister has no genuine fault to find with the amendment. This afternoon Deputy Andrews [411] and Deputy Faulkner asked the Minister for an assurance that between now and Report Stage he would give serious and favourable consideration to an amendment of the section on the lines outlined by us. That is a very reasonable request and it makes it quite clear that we are satisfied that an occasion may arise— on the last occasion I endeavoured to give the House an idea of how that occasion might arise—when the wording of section 7 (1) (a) might be found to be defective. Deputy Molloy's amendment would prevent that situation arising in which we could have difficulty in regard to a polling district in one constituency in the Dublin city and county area, with a polling district being broken off and separated into three sections, with one section representative of 150 voters going into one of the Dublin constituencies, another with 100 voters going into another constituency, and the remaining 50 to 200 going into a third constituency. Through the media the Government seem to be very anxious to sound out public opinion with opinion polls. We are now developing towards Government by opinion poll. It was suggested that the Minister should present section 7 to the ordinary man in the street and section 7 with the amendment added. If he did so, there is no doubt that ten out of ten reasonable people would accept that the section as amended would make far more logical and objective reading and be far more understandable from the point of view of the man in the street. That recommendation, coming, as it did, from a legal expert should even sell far better than coming from me, not being a legal expert.

I recall in 1977 when Sylvester Barrett was the man appointed to be the first Minister for the Environment by Jack Lynch and the many actions he took in that job, which he relished, until 1979 when he was moved to another Department following a change of leadership in Fianna Fáil, a change he did not support. Nevertheless, he continued to serve his party with loyalty and distinction and, as has already been said, he went on to represent the province of Munster in the European Parliament in 1984. At all times he was a courteous and gentle but strong and tough individual. He was very conscious of his position and very courteous to young Deputies like myself and others and very true to the Fianna Fáil Party into which he had been born, both literally and spiritually. He will be missed by many of the people who knew him here. Many of us learned with sadness of the very severe stroke he suffered which took away the quality of his life for his remaining years.

4260999,837,22,25,Topical Issue Debate - Employment Support Services,01/12/2011,Mr. Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin,Sinn Féin,Cavan-Monaghan,"I outlined a previous reply by the Minister to my colleague, Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh. It was the Minister’s reply that made reference to the FÁS work placement programme in the first instance. Sadly, it has brought no benefit other than the experience itself in the particular case I cite. With respect, although the Minister gave a lengthy, nine paragraph reply, it is only in the last paragraph that any reference is made to the situation in regard to one-parent family payment, which is the focus of my question.

660469,674,22,154,"Social Welfare Bill, 1948—Second Stage (Resumed).",29/07/1948,Mr. Seán MacEntee,Sinn Féin,Monaghan South,"The Minister has charged me with uttering a gross untruth and I am told it is quite in order. That is all I want to be certain about. I was going on to describe this Bill, not in exactly the same phraseology as the Minister has applied to something which I have said, but at any rate in terms which would leave the people under no misapprehension as to the deception which it is proposed to impose on them by the Title of the Bill. This Bill has been put before the House and has been justified here as a social welfare Bill. I think the Minister responsible for attaching that title to this measure might very well be charged with attempting to sell goods under a false description. I say that because there are six Parts in this Bill. Of these six Parts, no less than three are concerned mainly with imposing increased direct taxation on the employed worker and upon industry. By reason of the fact that the taxation is imposed in one part on the worker and in the second part on the products of his industry, it will ultimately, of course, fall upon the whole community in their capacity as consumers. There might be some justification for that if, as a result of this increased taxation, those who are called upon to pay it were going to receive any additional benefit. But in no case are [1775] the workers who are thus taxed going to get 1d. piece by way of additional benefit, in consequence of the new impost placed upon them. Yet by using what is plainly a deceptive title he is hoping to induce them to believe otherwise. The adoption of the title 'Social Welfare Bill' for this measure is to my mind a callous piece of cold-blooded trickery. It would be much better it, instead of endeavouring to deceive people as to the full scope of this measure and the nature of many of its provisions, the Government were straight and honest about it and described the Bill as it really is. First of all, it is a measure which has two purposes. The first aim as Deputy Com-mons's speech has shown is an attempt to quieten those who voted for the coalition Parties in the belief that old age pensions would be increased to 26/- per week, that pensions would become payable at 65, and that the means test would be abolished. That is what I might describe as the soporific purpose of the measure. I think, however, that in that respect it will prove to be much less effective than the Government expects. The second object of this Bill is to relieve the Exchequer of the cost of providing the additional amounts required to pay sickness benefit, disablement benefit, unemployment benefit and widows' and orphans' contributory pensions at the rates at which they have been paid, either in cash or in kind, for many years past. Since the Fianna Fáil Government introduced and instituted the system of supplementary allowances in extension of the benefits given under the various social schemes, insured persons who have been enjoying these supplementary benefits have not been called upon to pay one penny piece more than the original contribution fixed by statute. They got these supplementary benefits for nothing. Even Deputy Commons must be aware of that fact but, then, of course Deputy Commons now is struggling in the tentacles of the Fine Gael octopus. The stoppers are on his eye and that [1776] clear vision, which used to characterise him when he sat on these benches, has now become bedimmed and he is no longer awake to the fact that we were last year providing widows' and orphans' contributory pensions at the rates provided for in this Bill, that we were providing unemployment insurance benefits at the rates provided for by this Bill, that we were providing national health insurance benefits and national health disablement benefits at the rates provided for in this Bill and that we did not increase the contributions which were exacted from the workers in respect of that. Now, however, all that is changed. The workers are going to have to pay for these supplementary benefits in full. In some cases they are going to have to pay more than they would be justified in paying and the Exchequer is going to be relieved accordingly. Fine Gael, at any rate, has fulfilled one of its promises to its followers, because it did promise that if it were returned to power it would cut down a lot of expenditure on social services which it described as extravagant and it would relieve taxation upon its supporters. This Bill might as truly be entitled as the 'Social Insurance (Increase of Contributions) Bill, 1948', or the 'Social Services (Relief of the Exchequer) Bill, 1948', as to describe it as the Social Welfare Bill, 1948. One of the main purposes of the Bill—more than half of the Bill is taken up with provisions which are going to give effect to that purpose— is to increase taxation. It might be instructive if those who have been speaking here on behalf of the workers and praising this Bill would give some attention to what it is supposed to do under it. I do not know how many of those who have spoken in support of the measure and who have been full of praise for the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government of which he is a member, because they have introduced it, have taken the trouble to read the explanatory memorandum. I shall say this for the Minister—and, of course, I do not often have occasion to praise either any deeds or words of his—he has been at [1777] least straightforward in regard to this and has not concealed from any one of his supporters what he is proposing to do under this measure. The explanatory memorandum which he has issued makes it very clear that the national health insurance contributions will be increased if the Bill goes through in its present form. I do not see any reason why this House should permit it to go through in its present form. After all, last year the Fianna Fáil Administration was able to provide these benefits for the workers without imposing any additional taxation, and the year, as the Minister for Finance told us, wound up with a surplus. Therefore, as I have said, there is no reason why the increases which I am going to describe to the House should become effective if Deputies like Deputy Hickey and Deputy O'Leary, who purport to speak for the workers, take their courage in their hands and stand with us in opposing these provisions of the measure.",29/07/1948,13,567,568,They got these supplementary benefits for nothing Even Deputy Commons must be aware of that fact but then of course,Deputy Commons,now is struggling in the tentacles of the Fine Gael octopus The stoppers are on his eye and that 1776,Deputy Commons,660469_3,,They got these supplementary benefits for nothing Even Deputy Commons must be aware of that fact but then of course Deputy Commons now is struggling in the tentacles of the Fine Gael octopus The stoppers are on his eye and that 1776,They got these supplementary benefits for nothing Even Deputy Commons must be aware of that fact but then of course now is struggling in the tentacles of the Fine Gael octopus The stoppers are on his eye and that 1776,text899,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.120096115,0.003002403,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.621621622,0.592592593,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
4102879,2165,14,43,Electoral Representation (Amendment) Bill 2010: Second Stage,25/05/2010,Mr. Ciarán Lynch,The Labour Party,Cork South-Central,"I want to begin by thanking Fine Gael for bringing this Bill before the House this evening and commending Deputy Hogan on a Bill which has a simple and measurable intent. Reform can be looked at in three different ways. We can follow the big bang theory where a specific Minister decides that he or she will reform a number of measures at once or we can have the incremental approach where we engage in a reform process piece by piece over a period of time. I believe that what is being presented before the House this evening is very much the latter. It is a simple measurable immediate measure that can ensure that by-elections take place within a specific period of time. The third reform option is where we follow what I call the 'big blank' theory. The 'big blank' is what we have been getting from the Minister, Deputy Gormley since he came to office. We will possibly see a White Paper later this year, but whether it will ever be implemented and whether it will take the format of previous White Papers remains to be seen. We are hearing much talk of reform, but before the Minister this evening is an opportunity to engage and accept one measure of reform. In his speech this evening, the Minister stated he had some concerns about the proposal and that the six-month derogation was a difficulty for him. I would challenge him this evening to state that the Government will accept the Bill in its intent and at a later stage amend it so that emergency situations, such as the foot and mouth disease crisis, could put a deferment on it but that this House, in principle, accepts that no seat in Dáil Éireann will be left vacant for more than six months. That remedies the difficulty the Minister brought before the House this evening. If he believes that it is a genuine difficulty, here is a response to it I have given him and he can now let the Bill proceed. The position to date has resulted in this issue being debated repeatedly. Since I came to the House in 2007, I think this is my third or fourth time speaking on the issue of by-elections. During that period I have heard Ministers of State and Ministers come in here with the most bizarre of excuses as to why a by-election should not be called. Two weeks ago Minister of State, Deputy Curran gave some excuse that we had to focus on the economy and that the elections would be a distraction. There was some other issue of nonsense from the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan, that the children’s referendum would be contaminated if there were concurrent elections on that day. In both cases, it was a direct insult to the intelligence of the electorate in this country. The reality of the situation is that by-elections are a matter of fact. To date, we have witnessed two by-elections in this House and we have the issue of three more before us at present. Regrettably, by-elections happen due to the death of a Member, but they also happen due to resignations. By-elections now almost always happen as a consequence of results of European elections, which are on a five-year cycle. We know when the next European election will occur. It will occur in four years time, some time in June. The likelihood is that at least one candidate will be a Member of this House and he or she will be elected to the European Parliament. If one looks back over the past European elections, one will see that such is the case. Why not [89]legislate proactively for something rather than allow the difficulties that arise from inaction come before the House, as they have this evening? In essence, this is a problem that has long been before this House to which a solution has long been overdue and a solution has been brought before this House this evening. It is a solution that is simple, immediate and measurable. Put simply, it ensures that the democratic deficit that it is created in this House through the result of a single seat being vacant gets address. At present, there are three seats unoccupied in this Chamber. Regardless of the constituencies in which these vacant seats are situated, it could be in my constituency of Cork South-Central besides Donegal South-West, Dublin South or Waterford, the principle of this is not geography it is that there is a democratic deficit in this House where a constituency is being denied its full representation. It beggars belief to hear the Minister come in and give alternative explanations that defy that single fact, that there are three empty seats in this House that should be filled within the lifetime of the Government. Sadly, I do not think that will happen. I have listened to the Taoiseach in recent days and weeks comment upon this. When being questioned on it, he states it is a matter for the Dáil. Unfortunately, the Taoiseach is telling a big fib in the media because it is a matter, not for the Dáil but for Government under the present structure. The Government has no appetite for a by-election. The Taoiseach should desist from stating that it is a matter for the Dáil because he is not being truthful with the public and he is certainly not being truthful with the electorate in each of those constituencies.",25/05/2010,30,450,451,would be a distraction There was some other issue of nonsense from the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills,Deputy Coughlan,that the children's referendum would be contaminated if there were concurrent elections on that day In both cases it was,Deputy Coughlan,4102879_5,,would be a distraction There was some other issue of nonsense from the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills Deputy Coughlan that the children's referendum would be contaminated if there were concurrent elections on that day In both cases it was,would be a distraction There was some other issue of nonsense from the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills that the children's referendum would be contaminated if there were concurrent elections on that day In both cases it was,text685,3,0,0,0,40,-0.075,-3,-1.945910149,-0.048647754,-0.796486186,-0.019912155,0.032032032,0.014014014,0.01001001,0.047047047,0.001001001,0.02002002,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,0
1375100,65,8,77,Adjournment Debate: Dublin City Commissioner.,30/04/1969,Mr. Kevin Boland,Fianna Fáil,Dublin County,"This is an attack on a man who has given a lifetime of loyal service to this State and not to any political Party, a man who has served with distinction under 12 Ministers for Local Government. Deputy Ryan, as the agent of the Fine Gael Party, comes in here with these niggling, petulant and scurrilous questions to try to get material which he thinks he can use to undermine the character of the man who has been appointed as Commissioner to administer the affairs of Dublin Corporation, which Deputy Ryan was so much instrumental in seeing could not be administered by the representatives whom the people elected to do that. This adjournment debate arises because of the attempt by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition in Dublin Corporation to continue here in this House the scandalous political play-acting that they have been indulging in in the Dublin Corporation over the past couple of months and, indeed, I may say over practically the whole period of office of this City Council. The time of Dublin City Council has been taken up almost entirely with matters that are no concern of the corporation and the work that the corporation should be doing has been going by default. At committee level, of course, these same people have, in fact, been controlling the affairs of the Dublin Corporation because they have a majority there and if there are any excess provisions made in regard to the services in Dublin it is Fine Gael's and Labour's responsibility. Throughout the year they have been taking the decisions that require the raising of a certain amount of revenue but when it [325] comes to the taking of the final step in their year's activities they run out, as Deputy Dowling said, on their responsibilities and, to quote the former Fine Gael Minister for Health, Deputy T.

4068030,133,14,96,Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Powers of Inquiry) Bill 2010: Second Stage (Resumed).,17/02/2010,Ms. Joan Burton,The Labour Party,Dublin West,"I wish to share time with Deputy Joanna Tuffy. The Ceann Comhairle might tell me when five minutes have elapsed. Anyone who is elected to this House as one of 166 representatives continually feels it is an honour and a privilege to be asked by citizens to be their representative in the Dáil. However, what has been lost on the Government, particularly the Fianna Fáil element of the Government which has now been in power for 12 years, is the fact that at this time of major economic crisis people in Ireland are not just watching coverage of the Dáil, but are also tuning in from time to time to coverage of other Parliaments, particularly the House of Commons and the Houses of Congress in the United States. Some people also watch coverage of the French Parliament. Most people who have television here have access to those channels. What is stunning in the context of Deputy Rabbitte’s Bill is that we are currently enveloped in the greatest economic crisis this country and many other countries have ever seen since the 1920s and people’s interest in politics and political accountability is at an extraordinarily level. As politicians, all of us should welcome that fact. In the United Kingdom, the bankers who have been deemed to be culpable to a degree in the collapse of banking institutions in the UK have already been before several committees of the House of Commons, individually and collectively. In the United States there have been umpteen committee hearings. We have also seen the system the United States operates under Professor Elizabeth Warren, which is basically oversight, which reports to the Houses of Congress on everything to do with the banks. It is up on the website. One can 'tweet' her and get information from her, yet this country appears to be locked in post-colonial aspic. It is as though we inherited our parliamentary system from the United Kingdom. They moved on but we did not to the same extent. I say that in a non-partisan way. People endlessly confess now to tuning in compulsively to 'Oireachtas Report', which Deputy Rabbitte once said was for insomniacs and people who slumped in front of the television exhausted after a long night out. People are now consciously watching coverage of the Dáil and what Deputy Rabbitte has put forward in the Bill, and I congratulate him on this, is an opportunity for us to reform our procedures and meet the demand from people who believe this is their Parliament, we represent them and we will bring people like the bankers to some degree of account in explaining the policy that has led to our economic ruination. [669]The Green Party Members are not present but I would have thought this particular philosophy would be a central belief of everything I have ever known about the Green Party, including those I served with on county councils when I was a councillor. The British playwright, David Hare, has a play running in the UK at the moment called 'The Power of Yes'. It deals with the issue Deputy Higgins raised earlier, which is that when we have a powerful Executive combined with a powerful establishment in banking and in the media, all of whom are telling us to say 'Yes' in one direction only, very little stands between that enormous surge of power. The Government came in here on 29 September 2008 and told us that we must sign up to the guarantee to Anglo Irish Bank. We were told last year that we must put €11 billion in the banks at a time when the Government was cutting old age pensioners’ Christmas bonuses and social welfare recipients’ entitlements. The power of 'Yes' in this country from the point of view of an establishment of professional people who were involved in banking — the bankers themselves, the developers and the Fianna Fáil Party — has combined to make it almost unquestionable.

4423776,2326,22,224,Promissory Notes: Motion (Resumed) (Continued),14/02/2013,Mr. Michael Colreavy,Sinn Féin,Sligo Leitrim North,"This is the crux of the argument. The people of Ireland should not have to pay a cent of the debts of Anglo Irish Bank. The Government should have entered negotiations with the ECB seeking a write down of that debt. When the Acting Chairman, Deputy Bernard Durkan, spoke on this motion he asked where people got the fanciful idea that there could possibly be a write down of the debt. People first heard this from the parties that are now in government, prior to the election. They were told that not one red cent more would go into it while the Labour Party spoke about 'Labour's way or Frankfurt's way'. However, that was a pre-election promise and, as we know from the comments of a senior Cabinet Minister, pre-election promises do not count. Members on the Government benches may laugh and roll their eyes at the proposition that it is worthy to seek a write down of this debt. Perhaps that laughter is due to the Government recognising its own failings. Both parties in government received a mandate from the public to form a government as a result of stating that they were against the banking debt that Fianna Fáil had loaded onto the people. That is why their Members were elected and put on the Government benches. People believed what the parties told them. I do not know whether it was mass hypnotism, but the Government has now converted what was a loose deal in the form of promissory notes into sovereign debt. It has practically doubled the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank and has saddled future generations with today's debt. It might be a stab in the dark, but I believe that is Frankfurt's way, not Labour's way. It was unfair when the last Government initially committed taxpayers to bailing out private debt and it is just as unfair when this Government asks them now to do so. The initiative won when other countries, especially Spain, pushed the Eurogroup to commit to separating banking and sovereign debt has been well and truly squandered. That pressure should have been maintained. Throughout Europe I expect to see an acceptance that there must be a separation of banking and sovereign debt, but it will be too late for the taxpayers of this country. Some speakers on the Government side have compared this deal to extending the term of a mortgage. If one extends one's mortgage repayments over a longer period of time, it can be a good option even if one will end up paying more for one's house. It depends on circumstances. However, there is a fundamental difference between a mortgage and the deal this Government made with the ECB. After the mortgage is repaid, one is left with a house, an asset one can keep. After this private banking debt has been paid by the people of Ireland, however, they will be left with nothing. It is a wonder this Government with its neoliberal ideology is so keen to pump money into a black hole, yet resists investing in State assets that could provide employment and wealth for the State. In short, the deal can be summed up as the winding down of a toxic bank but not a winding down of the toxic debt. It is akin to pulling up the floor boards of a house because there is a leak beneath but not fixing the leak after doing so. However, we have gone a step further. We have practically doubled the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank. In addition, by forcing the Central Bank to sell the bonds on the market, the interest payable will not make its way back to the State's coffers. This will generate additional costs, which must also be taken into account. Making the bonds marketable is the price of covering the ECB legally, but even now we cannot put a price on that. We must pay an incalculable total in interest and capital for the next 40 years, yet the Government celebrates this as a wonderful deal. The spinning is happening, but behind the public relations and spin I believe we have a Government that is very uncertain about what will happen. The Government kept the electorate and the Members of the Dáil and Seanad in the dark last Wednesday week as to what will happen, but perhaps that was not a deliberate strategy on its part. Perhaps it is because the Government does not know what is happening or what will happen. Last week was a little reminiscent of what happened to another ill-fated head of government. When Neville Chamberlain arrived back in Britain in September 1938 he waved the deal he had with Germany, saying he believed it meant 'peace in our time'. Within a year Britain was at war with Germany. I sincerely hope that the deal the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance brought to this House is not like Mr. Chamberlain's and that we do not find ourselves in a significantly worse situation in a very short time. However, when the spinning in done and reality bites, the people of Ireland will soon clearly see how ill-judged this deal was. I said last week was a bad one for democracy and I believe that to be true. However, one very good aspect of democracy is that people will ultimately have the opportunity to give their opinion on this deal, a deal I believe will damage this country for decades. The people will give their verdict, and the sooner that day comes the better for the people and for the country.",14/02/2013,31,200,201,from the public to form a government as a result of stating that they were against the banking debt that,Fianna Fáil,had loaded onto the people That is why their Members were elected and put on the Government benches People believed,Fianna Fáil,4423776_3,,from the public to form a government as a result of stating that they were against the banking debt that Fianna Fáil had loaded onto the people That is why their Members were elected and put on the Government benches People believed,from the public to form a government as a result of stating that they were against the banking debt that had loaded onto the people That is why their Members were elected and put on the Government benches People believed,text946,2,0,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-1.609437912,-0.040235948,-0.276699295,-0.006917482,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.024024024,0.067067067,0.071071071,0.103103103,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,0

2969925,821,9,131,"Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998: Committee and Remaining Stages.",14/05/1998,Mr. Michael Noonan,Fine Gael,Limerick East,"I move amendment No. 2: In page 4, subsection (1)(b), line 4, after 'writing' to insert 'or in pursuance of a deposit paid'. When I raised this matter on Second Stage the Minister said he would consider it, but this is not reflected in any of his proposed amendments. When he made his announcement on 23 April, transitional arrangements were made to cater for persons who are in the process of buying a property. Initially, the Minister announced these would fall into two categories. First, if a written binding contract was in place prior to 23 April such a property would not be caught by the new fiscal restrictions. Second, if the full purchase price had been paid by September, this property would not be caught by the restrictive provisions either. This has given rise to difficulties which I outlined on Second Stage. For example, if a bona fide buyer has made a booking deposit before 23 April, has obtained the agreement of a lending agency to provide the money, the mortgage is in writing, the solicitors for both vendor and purchaser are in the process of drawing up the contract but it is not completed, he or she is caught by the terms of the Bill and will be unable to avail of interest relief if purchasing an investment [225] property. That is unfair on those who can prove they were bona fide purchasers. The Minister has moved to meet the second problem, where people buy apartments or houses from the plans and sign the contract. This is especially prevalent in Dublin. However, the construction and conveyancing would not be completed and the money would not be paid by the proposed deadline of next September. I thank the Minister for moving the deadline to the end of the year. I am aware many people wanted it extended by a further 12 months but a limit must be put on these matters. The end of the year is a reasonable concession. However, a concession should be made to the genuine purchaser. It is too restrictive not to include a process which has reached the signing of the written contract and the payment of the normal 10 per cent deposit. I know the Minister is concerned that looser provisions could be abused. However, it is possible for him to introduce an arrangement where, perhaps, a requirement could be made to produce a receipt for a deposit and a letter from a lending agency and solicitor. It is not beyond the regulators in his Department to produce a series of provisions which would put the case beyond doubt. It is very unfair that transactions involving willing buyers and sellers, arranged prices which are not subject to gazumping and paid deposits should be caught by the provisions. That is unfair. The amendment attempts to solve the problem by inserting the words 'or in pursuance of a deposit paid'. If a deposit is paid along the lines I have suggested, that should be sufficient. I do not want to deal with the situation reflected in the court case, the outcome of which was debated by Deputy Rabbitte and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy on the Adjournment earlier this week, where the vendor decided to raise the asking price after a deposit had been paid. In this instance, I am talking about somebody who paid a deposit prior to 23 April and a situation where there is no difficulty between purchaser and vendor. Following the Minister's announcement, that person will lose interest relief on which they had based their calculations. It is a net point which I have raised with the Minister before. I ask him to look at it again.",14/05/1998,28,530,531,situation reflected in the court case the outcome of which was debated by Deputy Rabbitte and the Minister of State,Deputy Molloy,on the Adjournment earlier this week where the vendor decided to raise the asking price after a deposit had been,Deputy Molloy,2969925_2,,situation reflected in the court case the outcome of which was debated by Deputy Rabbitte and the Minister of State Deputy Molloy on the Adjournment earlier this week where the vendor decided to raise the asking price after a deposit had been,situation reflected in the court case the outcome of which was debated by Deputy Rabbitte and the Minister of State on the Adjournment earlier this week where the vendor decided to raise the asking price after a deposit had been,text140,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.039528471,-0.000988212,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.294294294,0.296296296,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
2490669,1310,14,172,Adjournment Debate. - Cashel (Tipperary) F&Aacute S Teamwork Scheme.,28/06/1990,Mr. Michael Ferris,The Labour Party,Tipperary South,"I should like to thank the Chair for allowing us to raise the issue on the Adjournment and I am grateful to Deputy Ahearn for giving me some of her time. I have been concerned about the schools in Cashel and in the south-east region. The difficulties in them came to my notice following representation I made three weeks ago to the Minister seeking approval for the continuation of the Killenaule community project. I received a letter from FÁS to the effect that they had been in contact with the FÁS south-east region and had been advised that they had received no Teamwork budget for 1990 and, accordingly, could not recruit for Teamwork schemes. That has been the position since 1 January last for all five counties. FÁS went on to suggest the social employment scheme as an alternative but, as Deputy Ahearn pointed out, it is not suitable because of the many regulations laid down by the Departments of Labour and Social Welfare for participants to qualify. I received confirmation today from the County Tipperary Association for Mentally Handicapped Children of the concerns of parents in Scoil Aonghusa, Scoil Chormaic, the day care centre, the Nagle Centre where three teams of five people and a supervisor work, St. Ann's in Roscrea, and other schools for the handicapped in Munster. Mr. John Murphy, chairman of the association for mentally handicapped people in Munster, gave me details of the problems being [1617] faced. The Cashel and Emly youth service depends on assistance from the ingenious Teamwork scheme. It is not possible to operate the social employment scheme when catering for mentally handicapped children. We are concerned at the announcement by the Department of Health that they do not intend to provide funds for the health services and so on for those children. It appears that they have abandoned their responsibility and left the matter to the Minister for Labour. On the last occasion Oireachtas Members for the area visited Cashel we were able to promise that we would sort out the problems of the local centres and expressed our determination that they would not recur. There is no doubt that damage was done to the procedures used for caring for the children. I appeal to the Minister to allocate sufficient funds to take account of the needs of the south-east region. We have been progressive in our work but we are being penalised while other areas are permitted to continue. I should like to ask the Minister to use his good offices to sort out this problem.

3425856,133,14,96,Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2003: Second Stage.,29/01/2004,Ms. Joan Burton,The Labour Party,Dublin West,"I welcome the publication of the Bill and its reading in the House. The appointment of a financial services ombudsman is long overdue and has been promised by the Government for six or seven years. Therefore, the proposal in the Bill to appoint one is welcome. Like most modern economies, the Irish economy is fuelled, to a considerable extent, by credit, especially consumer credit. I note the upbeat Economic and Social Research Institute report on the future performance and prospects of the economy, the importance of the development of the service sector and the impact on the domestic market of the growing population. The consequence of this credit boom is that we live in a world of high pressure advertising by banks and financial institutions which continuously promote their services, instruments and credit to consumers of all ages and classes. Many families are now counting the cost of pre-Christmas spending sprees and are waking up to horrendous costs being charged to them by various financial institutions. In a significant number of cases consumers continue to be ripped off by financial institutions and financial service [1106]providers. Recent examples, of which we are all aware, include credit cards and store cards with extraordinarily high rates of interest charged on them, despite the fact that interest rates in the eurozone are at a historic low. Another example is the practice of moneylending companies which operate door-to-door businesses providing credit and a collection service at the door. In a number of clearly indicated cases these companies' interest rates run into several hundred per cent. I draw the Minister's attention to a fine investigation recently carried out by journalists from the Sunday Independent into that phenomenon. Some organisations responded to those reports in the Sunday Independent by saying that, while these credit institutions peddling door-to-door credit charge several hundred per cent interest, illegal moneylenders charge even more. Consumers are between a rock and a hard place. The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the IFSRA have been involved in pointing out the difference between the costs of insurance premiums, especially for young male drivers, and the fees associated with the provision of insurance services by brokers and such like. I commend the work started by the IFSRA and the consumer-director based there, which understandably up to now has largely focused on trying to inform consumers about their rights and give them a strong message that shopping around may save them considerable amounts of money. However, it is very early days yet for the IFSRA, which is still very much under the wing and control of the Central Bank. We have yet to see the day when it will bite. While the work it has done so far, particularly on consumer information, is to be commended, judgment has to be deferred until we see a conflict involving financial institutions or financial service providers. The jury is out on whether it is hidebound by the traditional conflict between the guardian role of the Central Bank and the role of an aggressive pro-consumer pro-regulation IFSRA. The Bill provides for the appointment of a financial services ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints about financial institutions and for the establishment of two panels, the consultative consumer panel and the consultative industry panel. It is important that consumer interests are strongly represented on both panels and that both panels and the authority are not composed by rounding up and appointing the usual suspects. By that I mean representatives of the various commercial industries and the various organisations in the banking and financial services industries with the usual collection of, in many cases, party political hacks. Having established a regulatory framework, while within all parties there are people deserving of public appointment, when setting up a regulatory authority we need people on the panels and authority with experience and who are independent-minded. We need people who can [1107]act with a degree of judicial impartiality in carrying out their functions as important roles are given in this Bill, some of which break new constitutional ground to which I will return later. It is not sufficient for the Minister simply to consult the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Taoiseach or other members of the Cabinet as he has indicated. We need a clear public procedure covering the appointment of up to 50 persons to the new structures that will apply when this Bill is enacted. There should be a public appointments process, which may entail advertising or a process of consultation. It is essential that representatives of organisations such as the Consumers Association of Ireland, which has done much good work over the years, should be on these panels. They have shown a clear expertise and dedication. The Minister should also consider organisations such as credit unions, which have offered not-for-profit credit, particularly to some of the poorest people in society. I hope the Minister will look at the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which was the victim of probably the most stupid and cruel cut by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. The Minister for Finance pulled the wool over her eyes when he got her to cut back in a mean way the financial arrangements which MABS could put in place for families and individuals who had gone considerably over their heads in becoming indebted to various moneylenders, loan sharks and financial institutions charging extortionate rates of interest. That was a mistake and I hope the Minister will seek to remedy it by consulting widely on the people he chooses for appointment to these various boards and panels. Members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which has taken a detailed interest in the problems of improper use of credit by poor families, should qualify for the Minister's consideration. We know that the financial services industry will offer people by the dozen and while those people will be well qualified for appointment to those panels, they will represent the sector from which they come. While in some cases their appointments will be appropriate, we also want strong independent voices who are champions of consumer interest. It is only in that way that the new authority will get courage to take on malpractice by financial institutions. I am aware that most banks and financial institutions provide decent services to and have good relations with their customers. However there are corner boys whose sole intention is to rip off consumers. Like many other Deputies I have occasionally dealt with families purchasing a house who find that they are in the grip of a mortgage provider whereby if they hit hard times and fall behind in their payments at any stage they are subject to unbelievable fines. Such areas of doubtful [1108]practice need to be clearly addressed by the new authority. Section 8 of the Bill deals with administrative sanctions, which can be applied by the regulatory authority where there are transgressions. It provides for fines of up to €5 million, orders to pay costs and, for directors and managers of financial institutions, disqualification from being involved in the management of a financial service provider. These are significant and onerous civil penalties. Has the Minister taken the advice of the Attorney General on the constitutional status of this new mechanism of imposing sanctions? Article 34. 1 of the Constitution, one of the cornerstones of the separation of powers, makes it clear that it is for the courts and judges to administer justice and to impose penalties on those who have transgressed the law. While this model comes through the European Union and under European law it is possible to provide such a structure, there are a number of cases where this law comes very close to carrying out the operations of a judicial function in a non-judicial environment. That has happened previously. I refer here to the judgment of Justice Kingsmill Moore in the case re solicitors in 1954 when he clearly stated that judgments can be exercised which are punitive. Fines of £5 million, disqualification from practising a profession or in a particular area of activity are strong and appropriate sanctions where there are transgressions of financial service regulations. I will be interested to hear the Minister indicate in his reply and on Committee Stage whether he is satisfied that these provisions are constitutional. There are several examples in the lifetime of the Government where legal advice has been found wanting. Many of these proposals were put forward by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, when he chaired the committee. He subsequently served as Attorney General and is now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Despite possessing one of the most eminent legal brains in this country, his record in second-guessing the courts and producing legislation that is acceptable to them is not brilliant. Has the Minister for Finance consulted the current Attorney General in respect of the constitutionality of section 8? I wish to deal with the section that provides for new reporting and auditing obligations for financial institutions. I was not directly concerned with the debate on the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act before it became law. As a fellow accountant, will the Minister for Finance offer a point of view on a specific matter? The Bill provides for the new reporting obligations for financial institutions. Would the Minister be prepared to accept an amendment from the Labour Party to include in the Bill some statutory protection, especially in the case of financial institutions, in respect of internal auditors, independent non-executive directors and the independent audit committee? As the Minister is aware, where companies have a listing on the Stock Exchange, as do most [1109]large banks and financial institutions, regulatory requirements arise from those bodies and they seek to attend to those functions. However, it emerged from the DIRT inquiry carried out by the House that the role of internal audit systems was critical in alerting the bank to what was happening and in obliging the banks and financial institutions to face up to their responsibilities in terms of their participation in widespread tax evasion in respect of customer accounts. Shareholders in Allied Irish Banks lost significant amounts of money in the scandal involving Allfirst Maryland, one of its subsidiaries. If there had been a stronger internal reporting function, a stronger internal audit committee and stronger independent executive directors operating in that bank, AIB might have been saved the grief and the loss caused by the actions of one of its traders. Will the Minister, in addition to applying to banks and financial institutions the requirements of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act, give specific consideration to the role of internal auditors in the banks? In my experience as an accountant — I am sure that of the Minister is similar — the continuing internal audit function in banks and financial institutions is the major protection and safeguard against fraud and malfeasance on the part of either staff or directors. Frauds are often perpetrated by the management, owners and directors of a company. We saw this in the cases of Parmalat and Enron where overweening and powerful founding families, directors or owners held sway. It takes a brave individual to threaten any of these entities or imply that their financial stewardship and management is less than perfect. The Bill provides an opportunity to provide further legislative protection in respect of the traditionally strong role played by internal audit systems in banks and financial institutions. The same goes for audit committees and independent non-executive directors. I attended a function last week at which a report was published by business women regarding the small number of women on the boards of Irish companies. It is interesting that the report was launched by Mr. Buckley from Allied Irish Banks who made an interesting and thoughtful contribution. Women are the main purchasers and consumers in our economy. I salute Deputy Richard Bruton for doing the family shopping. I live in an equal household, so I do some shopping and my husband does the rest. I invite the Minister for Finance to visit the shops from time to time to see what is happening in terms of prices. Will the Minister give a commitment that, of the authority and two panels to be established, at least one if not two will be chaired by a woman? There is no reason that the overall composition of the three bodies, of which there will be approximately 50 members, should not be on the basis of a 50-50 split between men and women. As the Minister stated previously, there are more [1110]than enough qualified women available and interested in doing those jobs. I wish to take up a point made by Deputy Richard Bruton in respect of the panels which will have an important regulatory function. I would like the members of the panels to be recruited through an open process. I accept that the Minister will have the final call on who will be appointed. However, the members of the panels and the regulatory authority should be obliged to make statements of their financial interests similar to those made by Members of the Oireachtas and local authority representatives in order that, especially in the case of people who come from the financial services industry, it can be clearly seen whether there might be potential conflicts of interest. The job of the panels will be important. Deputy Richard Bruton correctly referred to the ridiculous level of resources available to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. Mr. Jonathan Westrup, in his lecture to the ACCA, remarked that the capacity of the Oireachtas committees to oversee regulators is limited and that there is not a high level of interest among Members in this regard. In my experience there is a high level of interest and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which has a mixture of economists, accountants, former bankers and people with significant experience in business and other walks of life among its members, is an example of this. The members of the committee are well qualified for the job expected of them. However, the committee is entirely without resources to carry out the job of overseeing regulatory agencies. 12 o'clock What resources will the Minister allocate to the panels so they can properly carry out their functions? If their members will simply get a monthly lunch in the Central Bank headquarters at which, just before lunch is served, they will be given a three page statement outlining what is being done, that is not regulation. The panels should be empowered to bring to the attention of the regulator, for example, the fact that people are paying 300% interest rates to loan sharks and to ask what will be done to prevent consumers being ripped off. We want regulatory panels with teeth in terms of the power to raise issues as they affect consumers, big and small, in the operation of financial services and industries. One issue I invite them to address is how mortgage lenders act when people get into difficulty with their mortgage repayments. Some mortgage providers charge extortionate fines when mortgage payers fail to keep to the schedule of their agreement. There is a great deal of work to be done in detailing and building up a picture for the Oireachtas of how the new structure will work. The new structure is welcome. In principle, much of its operation should go well, although I have grave doubts about the constitutionality of section 8. I welcome the establishment of the panels provided they are independent, [1111]appointment is on merit, there is an appropriate gender balance and they do not simply become the province of party political or industry hacks. That is important. The people on the panels must be independent. If we achieve that and if the panels are properly resourced to target those areas that are regularly identified as areas in which consumers and small business may be abused, we will create a financial services regulatory authority ombudsman that will have real teeth. Following representations from the Director of Consumer Affairs, there is an attempt in the miscellaneous sections of the Bill to regulate the practices of mortgage intermediaries. These are people who find mortgages for clients. In my constituency, and probably in the Minister's, there are many people who provide mortgage intermediary services. Some of them are providing those services as a consequence of leaving banks and building societies. They are providing a good service. Others, however, are charging high fees and I welcome the proposal to regulate the way fees for such services are provided. I am concerned that some of these mortgage intermediaries are too close to the big builders who are building the estates. It is a closed circle and the young couples buying houses, being so anxious to get into the property market and to get a mortgage, end up with insufficient knowledge of how much they will actually pay in terms of the capital cost, which they are borrowing, and the service charges that surround obtaining the eagerly sought mortgage. I welcome that provision in the Bill but perhaps the Minister will explain in further detail how it is proposed to deal with it. The consumer-director has also been at pains in recent months to give more information about certain financial services products, in particular, products such as tracker bonds. Many people have little financial expertise. The general rule is caveat emptor and, ultimately, consumers must take responsibility for their actions. Nonetheless, there are financial service products available, such as tracker bonds, which are new and are strongly marketed as almost guaranteeing financial returns. Consumers do not have the capacity to read the small print and significant numbers of people have sustained significant losses from these products as a result of the fluctuating stock markets in the past couple of years. The IFSRA is empowered to give information to consumers about the pros and cons of different types of financial products. I hope that when the panels are established they will go a step further and examine and inquire into some of these products.",29/01/2004,29,292,292,carried out by journalists from the Sunday Independent into that phenomenon Some organisations responded to those reports in the Sunday,Independent,by saying that while these credit institutions peddling door-to-door credit charge several hundred per cent interest illegal moneylenders charge even,Independent,3425856_2,,carried out by journalists from the Sunday Independent into that phenomenon Some organisations responded to those reports in the Sunday Independent by saying that while these credit institutions peddling door-to-door credit charge several hundred per cent interest illegal moneylenders charge even,carried out by journalists from the Sunday Independent into that phenomenon Some organisations responded to those reports in the Sunday by saying that while these credit institutions peddling door-to-door credit charge several hundred per cent interest illegal moneylenders charge even,text546,3,2,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-0.336472237,-0.008411806,0.046291005,0.001157275,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.232232232,0.232232232,0.487487487,0.475475475,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
1415760,1082,8,86,Committee on Finance. - Vote 27: Office of the Minister for Education (Resumed).,21/04/1970,Mr. Jim Tunney,Fianna Fáil,Dublin North-West,"Therefore, the results, if we take examination results, will be better in school A than in school B and ultimately we may reach the point at which anybody really interested in education for his children will not have any option but to move them to school A as against school B. I compliment the Department on what they have done to date in this respect and I compliment the Minister. The Department must be adamant in this. In some areas there were what we call post-primary schools—to me they are secondary schools—where vacancies existed, and in any case where [1598] vacancies exist in any kind of post-primary school, where it can be shown that the student entering is at liberty to pursue any course leading to the leaving certificate, in no circumstances should the Department in the name of the people be prepared to spend money on the building of another type school to satisfy the vanity and the unChristian attitude of people. There are two points to which I should like to refer by way of reference to contributions already made. I have referred to the contribution of Deputy FitzGerald and presently I shall return to another point made by him on which I should like to take issue. To keep a balance, however, I should like to refer to a point made by Deputy Desmond. I have been with Deputy Desmond at one or two functions at which he, I and other people spoke to teachers on education. I listened to him here and I have said before that I am mindful of the worthwhile contributions he makes in this House. Indeed, there are times when I envy him his knowledge and his ability to get his points across. There is one matter in the course of his contribution which is topical and which I should, perhaps, mention. It has had, perhaps, too much publicity and from Deputy Desmond's contribution a false notion might get abroad. The point to which I refer is in relation to corporal punishment. At column 1529 of the Official Report he is reported: There has been a considerable change in the educational system. The abandonment of the results system whereby you could almost have said the pay of the teacher depended on the answers given by the children has certainly meant getting rid of any understandable physical violence against children in school. Here we have a very serious charge against our national teachers, a suggestion that national teachers beat children for the sake of getting results in examinations. This point is extended further on. Later in the same column the Deputy spoke about 'this behaviour' inevitably bringing down the good name of the teachers.",21/04/1970,19,232,233,keep a balance however I should like to refer to a point made by Deputy Desmond I have been with,Deputy Desmond,at one or two functions at which he I and other people spoke to teachers on education I listened to,Deputy Desmond,1415760_3,,keep a balance however I should like to refer to a point made by Deputy Desmond I have been with Deputy Desmond at one or two functions at which he I and other people spoke to teachers on education I listened to,keep a balance however I should like to refer to a point made by Deputy Desmond I have been with at one or two functions at which he I and other people spoke to teachers on education I listened to,text401,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.177972987,0.004449325,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.725725726,0.682682683,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
2445977,986,26,93,"Supplementary Estimates, 1989 (Resumed). - Vote 44: Forestry.",12/12/1989,Mr. Pat Rabbitte,The Workers' Party,Dublin South-West,"There is a lot in the Estimate and in the Minister's contribution which I welcome, including the Minister's pronunciation of Coillte Teoranta. I thought I was alone in my pronunciation of it. I accept that this Estimate relates to additional money for private forestry. I am in favour of the development of private afforestation expecially having regard to the failure of successive [1144] Governments to exploit the natural advantage we have for forestry development. As Deputy Kavanagh said, there is detectable in the Minister's address the suggestion that notwithstanding the purpose of Coillte Teoranta and the debate that surrounded its establishment, private afforestation is gradually getting into the ascendancy. It is natural to expect a considerable improvement in performance when one looks at the very generous grants available for private afforestation. That is not to suggest that this should not be done because we are still at a figure of 5 per cent afforestation as compared to an EC average of about 24 per cent. We have a long way to go but, as Deputy Kavanagh said, we would not like Coillte Teoranta and public afforestation to become the poor relation of the forestry programme. It is remarkable that in 1948 a White Paper was published on this question which proposed a target of 10,000 hectares of new plantations per annum and now approaching 1990 we have still only achieved about half that rate. Since Coillte Teoranta was only established at the beginning of this year it is too early to make an assessment but there is a suggestion that the greater emphasis in Government policy is now on private forestry rather than on State forestry. The question raised by the progress to which the Minister referred relates to the development of an integrated wood industry here as a result of the improvement in the figures. I am aware from Question Time recently that the Minister is about to announce that a pulp mill will be located somewhere in the country and that negotiations are at an advanced stage with the IDA. I am directly interested in that, and not only because of the opportunity it provides us to avail of the increased significance of forestry. A sum of £298 million was the 1987 figure that we spent on imported paper, therefore the establishment of a pulp mill gives us an opportunity for import substitution. If the Minister is about to announce the establishment of a pulp mill, hopefully downstream development from that would be the establishment of a paper [1145] mill. I certainly have a very direct concern about that because of the closure of the last paper-making facility at Clondalkin where the mill, the equipment and the plant is in perfect working order, where the workforce have been idle since its closure, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is due on Thursday to meet with the works committee from that plant. I hope that what we are viewing here is the possibility of the revival of the paper-making industry in this country and that that will include in the Minister's grand design the reopening of Clondalkin paper mills. The Minister referred to the development of private forestry which he says is also greatly assisted by the services of private forestry contracting and investing companies. Indeed, several such companies have emerged in recent years, raising serious questions about the monitoring of the generous grants that are available for private afforestation and about the abuse of the taxation measures that apply to all other workers. There is and always has been a serious black economy problem in the forestry industry and because of the nature of the operations it is very difficult at any given time to quantify this. In the early days of the industry, for example, this major scope for evasion operated in the timber harvesting area. The system was that the Department of Forestry, as they then were, sold their timber standing and the purchaser hired a contractor. The contractor and his casual labour operated mostly in the black economy. The amount of timer being sold by the forest service is increasing rapidly and this system of purchaser harvesting is increasing on a pro rata basis, hence the black economy operators are an expanding category. Deputy Kavanagh referred to another source of black economy labour that began to emerge in forestry in the early eighties when the Department began to put their work out to contract and reduce their own permanent workforce. This trend is continuing, on my information, at an accelerating pace and with it a new [1146] category of black economy contractors who are paid by the State. We can now identify a third category who have emerged. These are contractors who are engaged in a heavily subsidised sector of private afforestation and this trend by all appearances is set to continue. Studies have been done which I recommend to the Minister on this aspect of evasion and availing of the black economy. For example, the trade unions involved have produced such a study and have drawn attention to a number of points. They have drawn attention to the fact that the workforce do not work in their home areas but are absent on specific days of the week. They use names and aliases such as 'John Smith', which abound there is a big turnover of staff: they are anxious to work on Saturdays and, as Deputy Kavanagh said, they work for a pay rate which is normally not viable. The Minister for Social Welfare himself instanced this industry as an area where these practices are rife. The Committee of Public Accounts have recently drawn attention to the matter. The Programme for National Recovery includes a clause committing the partners to ensure the eradication of the black economy from the growing forestry industry, and a number of reports have been prepared on it. By way of positive recommendation I suggest to the Minister that the withholding tax system be introduced for all contractors and subcontractors in the absence of a tax clearance certificate. The level at which the withholding tax should be set is a matter for debate. Secondly, a certified statement including the names, home addresses, RSI numbers and amounts paid should be obtained for contractors, subcontractors and employees in all cases, and finally the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners should be notified by the forestry service of all available information as a matter of routine.",12/12/1989,26,175,176,as compared to an EC average of about 24 per cent We have a long way to go but as,Deputy Kavanagh,said we would not like Coillte Teoranta and public afforestation to become the poor relation of the forestry programme It,Deputy Kavanagh,2445977_2,,as compared to an EC average of about 24 per cent We have a long way to go but as Deputy Kavanagh said we would not like Coillte Teoranta and public afforestation to become the poor relation of the forestry programme It,as compared to an EC average of about 24 per cent We have a long way to go but as said we would not like Coillte Teoranta and public afforestation to become the poor relation of the forestry programme It,text138,1,1,1,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.144115338,-0.003602883,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.172172172,0.197197197,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
985408,674,22,154,"Committee on Finance. - Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill, 1958—Second Stage.",25/11/1958,Mr. Seán MacEntee,Sinn Féin,Monaghan South,"No, I understand that. What we are talking about here is not the personal income of any one individual: what we are discussing is the income of a family treated as a unit. For that purpose the operative limit of income under the legislation is £800 but it is quite correct to say that in certain circumstances it may be £1,100—the £800 plus £100 for each of the three children. There is no use in trying to ring the changes on this. For all practical purposes we take the £100 as the norm and we say that if by any chance a child earns £100 or under, even though the aggregate family income may be in fact £900, it is still treated as £800. I must say I am sorry I cannot have very much sympathy with the point which Deputy Larkin made. After all, the Constitution provides and I think the canons of Christianity also regard the family as a unit. Children are bound as a matter of natural duty to care for and assist their parents. That is a fundamental principle. If those children are to get married or something like that and the parents decide they will not ask them to contribute to the support of the household, I do not think those parents have any right to pass portion of the burden of maintaining the household on to other persons quite outside the family. That is my answer to Deputy Larkin. I did cite the case of children saving up to get married as a justification of what I was proposing to do. As an example, I said it might happen that there would be circumstances in which it was not equitable, having regard by and large to general considerations, to regard the whole of a child's earning as inuring to the benefit of the family as a unit. Deputy Larkin said they would probably spend quite an amount upon themselves, but if they do that they do so with the permission of their [949] parents and if parents permit their children to spend every penny they earn and to disregard their responsibility to the family as a whole, as I say, that is the look out of the parents. They cannot expect that other people will bear the burden the children of the household are not prepared to accept. Deputy Carty wanted to know how this Bill would affect the position of doctors. The position of doctors will remain unchanged under this Bill, the only thing being that if any of those 80,000 persons require the services concerned they will be entitled to them. Otherwise the position so far as the medical profession is concerned will be quite unchanged. Deputy O'Donnell cited the case of persons in Donegal who were earning their livelihood abroad. He did not make a very good case because he mentioned that these people only returned home perhaps for a month during the summer and perhaps a week at Christmas, making five weeks in all but they were regarded as being 'normally resident' and therefore their income was aggregated with that of the members of the family who remained at home. Of course, I cannot be responsible for the way which the term 'normally resident' is interpreted but it would seem to me that that certainly was not a case of normally resident, even if they did happen to appear on the electoral register. There is another way of dealing with that which I will not suggest to Deputy O'Donnell because he probably knows it. I am sure if he were to adopt the remedy he has in mind it would be found to cut both ways.",25/11/1958,16,141,142,still treated as 800 I must say I am sorry I cannot have very much sympathy with the point which,Deputy Larkin,made After all the Constitution provides and I think the canons of Christianity also regard the family as a unit,Deputy Larkin,985408_1,,still treated as 800 I must say I am sorry I cannot have very much sympathy with the point which Deputy Larkin made After all the Constitution provides and I think the canons of Christianity also regard the family as a unit,still treated as 800 I must say I am sorry I cannot have very much sympathy with the point which made After all the Constitution provides and I think the canons of Christianity also regard the family as a unit,text408,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.240152199,0.006003805,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.80980981,0.756756757,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
880900,353,14,77,Audience for Six County Representatives—Motion.,28/10/1954,Mr. Sean Dunne,The Labour Party,Dublin County,"I have listened to quite a number of debates in this House which touched upon the question of Partition, and I do not think that any debate at which I have been present at any rate has occasioned so much interest, even among the Deputies of this House, as this particular discussion. I venture to say that that reflects the mind of the country generally. I am prompted to inquire why this is so, and I come to the conclusion which I think most people in the House will agree with, that there has been within the last couple of months a livening of nationalist and republican opinion, and the conclusion cannot be [220] escaped that the reason for that livening and that stirring of the old feeling of nationhood has been due not to speeches made at Manfield's Corner, not to speeches made at election or other public meetings, but to the actions of young men at Omagh and Armagh. Whether these actions be deemed by Parties or members of this House as wise or unwise that remains the fact. An interest has been stirred for the first time in many years in this problem of Partition by the daring and bravery of young Irishmen. Listening to the speeches made against this motion, I was struck by one thing— that no constructive argument was adduced, despite what the Taoiseach has said, to invalidate the very excellent reasons put forward so ably by the mover of the motion in support of his proposal. I was also struck particularly by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. Deputy McQuillan referred to the cautiousness associated with the advance of years. It is something which is natural, unavoidable and understandable, but I would like to ask this: is something right because it is done by one individual and does it become wrong when it is done by another individual simply because the first individual has changed his mind about it? I do not accept that point of view. Reference was made by all the speakers to certain historic happenings in this country. Reference was made to the First Dáil and to the fact that that Dáil was regarded as being representative of the whole nation. Have we then reduced the status of this Assembly to a sectional one by our actions over the years? It would seem so. It would seem that we, to a very great extent, relinquished our claim to sovereignty and independence for the 32 Counties of this country. It is high time we did something about reestablishing that claim. I am one of those who believe that speechifying whether in this country or outside it, talking at rallies in England or America has little effect upon the essential problem of Partition. I have often been struck by the utter futility of walking down O'Connell Street and [221] listening to speakers in our principal thoroughfare talking about Partition to the converted, talking about the evils of Partition to those of us who know all about it and are anxious to see it ended. Talking in this House about Partition and condemning it in the fashion in which it has been condemned is of little avail either, in my opinion. We of the Labour Party feel that this is a constructive move towards the solution of this problem. It could be the beginning of a movement which will end this evil of Partition for all time. Deputy McQuillan posed the question: What is the alternative if this is not accepted by the Dáil? Neither Deputy de Valera nor the Taoiseach had any alternative to offer beyond that which has been bruited about for the past 30 years —patience, wait and see, and goodwill. How long does it take to establish goodwill between complete opposites? How long would it have taken to bring about the unification of the great American nation had they depended upon the development of patience and goodwill? Was it wrong that Lincoln should have united the American nation in the fashion in which he did? I think that we as the elected Parliament of this country are accepting a very false position in accepting the right of a minority in part of our country to say to us that they will never under any circumstances join in a 32-County Republic. We are shirking our responsibilities in that respect. Deputy McQuillan referred also to the position that exists in relation to the election of Senator Kelly to the Seanad. That is an extraordinary position. Senator Kelly was elected by the people of his area on the understanding that he would accept allegiance only to a Republican Parliament. As far as I am aware that position also applies in relation to Mr. McGleenan. Senator Kelly has been elected to the Seanad of the Twenty-Six Counties by the votes of those who represent the people on county councils. Is that not in itself an indication, to a very great extent, of the feeling of the people of this part of the country in so far as a motion of this kind [222] is concerned? Have we not departed in this debate, to a very great extent, from an appreciation of the true feelings of the mass of the people of Ireland? Have we the right to set ourselves up here to take an entirely different view of a motion on this kind, and on the general question of Partition, from that taken by the ordinary people throughout the country? I do not think we have. I think some of the speeches have been no more than a device to escape unpleasant facts. It has been repeated that this is a very difficult problem, that it is difficult to see what the solution is. Someone said that there is no solution visible in the foreseeable future. Was it right, I wonder, for young men to have taken arms in 1916 against what was then established authority? If we asked any of those young men whether they considered that to be right or wrong, we know what their answer would be. Is it not a fact that in those years you had a majority of the Irish people antagonistic towards the idea of the use of arms, that you had a majority of the Irish people supporting a constitutional Party which accepted the status quo of that day, and which condemned any action, if not by word, at least by inference, of the kind undertaken by the brave men who went out and fought in that year? How different is the situation to-day? Is it not an extraordinary thing that we have counselling moderation and caution and patience the men who actually rejected such advice 30 years ago? It is a tragic thing, and it is due, I believe, to what has been referred to by Deputy McQuillan as the inevitability of advancing years. Is it reasonable to expect the young men of this generation to accept that dictum? I do not think it is. I think it is very unreal and it should be recalled that a completely new generation has grown up in this country since those days, a generation which has no recollection, good, bad or indifferent, other than what they have heard from their parents, of the events of those years, a generation which is perhaps more intensely educated in the nationalist and the republican tradition [223] than was the generation of 30 years ago, and consequently a generation greater in numbers, who are more interested in the securing of full independence for this country. In that situation should their feelings be ignored? I am not concerned with whether or not it is politically dangerous to ignore them I am concerned with the justice of ignoring them. I feel that the least this Dáil might do is to adopt this motion. Obviously it is not going to, because both large Parties are committed to opposition to the motion, and that, to my mind, is short-sighted. I referred to the fact that it has been a debate in which great interest has been taken. I have stated my belief that that is due to the action of young men in Armagh and Omagh. I wonder what action would have been taken 30 years ago in relation to such men by those who are now condemning the actions of these men. Would I be wrong if I suggested that if the mind and the will and the idealism and the bravery and the courage which is exemplified by these boys and which was present 30 years ago in the men who condemn this motion to-day, were acted on, it is far more likely that we would see the British Ambassador placed under arrest? We have dealt in a welter of words and when this debate is over we will be back where we started. We will have achieved nothing towards the solution of Partition and we may rest assured that for another year or two years the Dáil will take little interest in that problem, unless something happens to inspire such interest. I am struck by the possibilities of the motion. Supposing it were to be adopted and an invitation extended to all elected representatives of the people to come here from the North of Ireland and have a right of audience in the Seanad, is it not possible that that might have the unifying effect, which the Taoiseach desires, upon the various warring Nationalist sections in the North? We all know that the situation exists, that there is disunity among them—an exasperating thing to those in the South—whereas, upon this [224] question there is no disunity among Parties generally. But supposing the representatives were received here from the North is it not possible that that might have the effect such as I described, a unifying effect? Is it not further possible that it might bring about a civil disobedience campaign in the North where there would be no question of bloodshed whatsoever. Civil disobedience as a political weapon has, as we know, secured far greater political results in the world than the solution of the problem we are discussing to-day. The great nation of India achieved its freedom by the use of that particular political weapon. Could this motion not be the beginning of such a development? How do we know if we do not try? We are not going to try, and it is obvious that no more than a handful will vote in this House to-night for this motion. I will gladly vote for it, and I am sure other members will too, and I want to say that I consider that Deputy McQuillan, in bringing it forward here, has done a service to those who are interested in seeing the end of Partition and, regardless of what has been said in criticism of him, we shall see the day when the Irish nation generally will regard the motion and the sentiments expressed by him, as farsighted, prophetic and beneficial to the nation as a whole.",28/10/1954,15,268,269,motion in support of his proposal I was also struck particularly by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition,Deputy McQuillan,referred to the cautiousness associated with the advance of years It is something which is natural unavoidable and understandable but,Deputy McQuillan,880900_1,,motion in support of his proposal I was also struck particularly by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition Deputy McQuillan referred to the cautiousness associated with the advance of years It is something which is natural unavoidable and understandable but,motion in support of his proposal I was also struck particularly by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition referred to the cautiousness associated with the advance of years It is something which is natural unavoidable and understandable but,text217,2,4,0,0,40,0.05,2,0.587786665,0.014694667,0.110806209,0.002770155,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.646646647,0.627627628,0.605605606,0.574574575,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
3996779,1829,22,91,Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008: Report and Final Stages.,25/06/2009,Mr. Aengus Ó Snodaigh,Sinn Féin,Dublin South-Central,"I compliment Deputy Ciarán Lynch on this well-crafted amendment which allows the Minister of State the opportunity to address properly an issue that has over the years caused many people who live in local authority flat complexes to question the tenant purchase scheme. The area I represent includes the south-west inner city, which has the highest concentration of local authority flats of anywhere in Europe. Many of the people in those flats are proud of their origins and of where they live, and have spent a good deal of money doing up their homes. Some of their homes resemble palaces a similar pride in one’s home might not be evident in many of the most expensive houses in the country. These people want to continue to live in their homes, but they would like to own them. I have always had a problem with regard to the sale of local authority housing stock. The reason for my concern is that the moneys from such sales have not been properly reinvested in other local authority housing. That said, there is a way to deal with this at local authority level. Councils could take a decision that moneys returned should be reinvested or they should purchase or build 1. 5 homes for every home sold. There should be a mechanism in place. That should not prevent us from looking at all of the problems, anomalies and challenges of allowing people to purchase flats. Quite a bit of work has been done on this Bill which addresses some of those issues. There are still significant challenges out there, in terms of shared balcon[102]ies, charges and the like, and I wish those who will be dealing with them at local authority level the best in trying to deal with the intricacies of the challenges. This is a fair mechanism within the restrictions often put in amendments to allow the Minister to examine the issue again and reward these people for their patience in trying to deal with the discrimination that has occurred. Everybody else in local authority housing was able to benefit from the Millennium scheme. I have been dealing with some who did not benefit from it and are still looking for homes to be sold to them at the price they were offered some time ago. People have waited and have asked local authorities time and again for permission to buy. I do not know how many questions I have asked about this since I was elected in 2002, but once or twice a year I have asked what the delay was in addressing the tenant purchase scheme for flats. It is appropriate that some recognition is given to the people who went to the trouble of recording their desire to purchase the flats. Everybody else can be dealt with in the normal scheme of things set out here and that is important. It is important we are moving to that stage because it will create a better environment in many flat complexes, where there will be a mix of those who own their own flats and those who are living in local authority housing. That mix of people has worked well in the housing schemes, such as Part V and others,across the city. It creates challenges for everyone but it is the way forward and that has been accepted by everyone. The only alternative I can see to the discount suggested is that the Minister of State agree that the sale price be set at the market value at the time these people expressed an interest. That would create a significant burden, namely, trying to figure out what the price was on a certain date ten or 15 years ago. That is why I am inclined towards setting a discount based on the time at which the people expressed an interest. Hopefully the Minister of State will be able take to it on board, even at this late stage, because it does not force him to do anything today. Rather, he can produce a directive or a regulation to the local authorities in line with what is proposed in this amendment.",25/06/2009,30,4,5,I compliment Deputy,Ciarán Lynch,on this well-crafted amendment which allows the Minister of State the opportunity to address properly an issue that has over,Ciarán Lynch,3996779_2,,I compliment Deputy Ciarán Lynch on this well-crafted amendment which allows the Minister of State the opportunity to address properly an issue that has over,I compliment Deputy on this well-crafted amendment which allows the Minister of State the opportunity to address properly an issue that has over,text812,0,3,0,0,23,0.130434783,3,1.945910149,0.084604789,0.367423461,0.015974933,0.97997998,0.908908909,0.937937938,0.97997998,0.911911912,0.955955956,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0
890057,461,9,151,"Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance and Amendment) Bill, 1954—Second Stage. (Resumed.)",24/02/1955,Capt. Patrick Giles,Fine Gael,Meath-Westmeath,"And there is nothing wrong with it. Major de Valera: No. I am merely dealing with the statement that was impressed with some vehemence on me by Deputy Dillon who, incidentally, is advertised in that very same advertisement as addressing meetings — presumably in support of that policy — at Trim at 8. 30 and at Navan at 9. 30 on Saturday, 15th May. I think that is legitimate. I could multiply these instances, but the point is that here we have official Fine Gael propaganda over the Fine Gael name and couched in terms of specific promises. The word 'will' is used and if I were to find only one of these, I think it would have been sufficient. Here is a selected file of Fine Gael advertising material. I would ask any impartial set of people did not the impression created by that propaganda [936] from start to finish contain an implied promise that there was a positive policy to reduce the cost of living? In the previous by-election they were even more explicit still. These remarks are addressed in reply to Deputy Dillon. Was that not the Fine Gael policy? We are quite clear on the Labour policy, what it was and what it still is. If success can be achieved along those lines, as someone else said, objectively it is a very good thing to see. Far from an attitude of disappointment on anybody's part that that should be so, there should be an attitude of congratulation. This particular approach is not one I would have taken by choice, but so much has it come into this debate that it calls for an answer. There was the manifesto that the Fine Gael Party issued after the election and before they formed the Government. It ran:— 'Recognising that the main issue in the general election was the question of prices, the Parties forming the Government are determined to reduce the cost of living in relation to people's incomes and in particular to effect a reduction in the prices of essential foodstuffs. As an earnest of their intention in this respect, it is proposed to reduce the price of butter in the near future. A detailed announcement of the Government's proposals will be made in the course of a fortnight.' There is no doubt about it: in regard to butter, they did. That statement said: 'Recognising that the main issue in the general election.' There is an admission in the official document of the Fine Gael Party — which incidentally purports to speak for the other Parties in the Coalition as well. It says: 'The main issue was the question of prices,' and it voices its determination to reduce the cost of living. These are quite laudable aims. My purpose is to answer some of these points. We are entitled to approach this on the fact that the main issue in the last election was the issue of prices. The propaganda of the Fine Gael Party in particular and also of the Labour Party — I do not think they will [937] deny it — was that under the Fianna Fáil Government, because of what that Government had done, the cost of living had risen intolerably on the people's backs, specifically that the subsidies should not have been removed. 'Removed' is not quite the word, because a considerable volume of subsidy was left and is still there. The propaganda was that the subsidy should have been maintained and that there was an explicit and implied promise to reduce the cost of living. I do not think I am being either unobjective or unfair when I say that. At least the Labour Party said something definite and unequivocal. The Fine Gael Party — with the facility for succumbing to the political expediency of the moment which I regret to say appears to have been the weakness of that Party from its inception — had some of its members saying: 'We will make no promises,' while others were making promises as fast as they could and trying to have it both ways. Whatever the result was, I think I am not exaggerating or painting an untrue picture when I say that particularly the housewife element, as Deputy Mrs. Lynch said, that voted for the Coalition Government thought they were voting for a reduction in the cost of living. To complete the record and, as a corrective to some things said in the debate, I want to make a couple of small points. There is the Labour attitude, in case I am challenged as to the Labour Party programme. It was printed on the back of a number of its candidates' election literature, always headed: 'The Labour Party's Programme.' It contains a paragraph 'Reduction in Prices', and this or a very similar phrase in practically every case—I am not accusing them of inconsistency there was nothing inconsistent in their attitude:— 'A reduction of food prices and the provision of subsidies on essential articles of food to achieve this object.' The present Tánaiste, as a candidate, emphasised that amongst other things. There is a circular letter which he sent out in the course of the election [938] to certain people, signed 'W. Norton, T. D.':— 'A Chara, As you are an elector in the County Kildare Constituency, I take the liberty of enclosing herewith a copy of my election address and would kindly invite your attention in particular to the portion of the programme set out in page 3 under the heading 'Reduction in Prices.' In view of the serious effect of increasing taxation on cigarettes, beer and spirits — which no doubt has had an injurious effect on your trade — I trust that you will find it possible to give me your Number One Vote in the forthcoming election and kindly ask your relatives and friends to do likewise, so that with the aid of the Labour Party I may advocate in the new Dáil a reduction of the taxes which so adversely affect your business and the consumers generally. Mise, le meas, W. Norton, T. D.' All that picture means one thing, that it is futile for us to say the main issue in the general election was not prices. It is natural that the main issue in this debate here is a matter of prices. It is a very difficult question. I am not for one moment going to attack the present Minister or the Government to which he belongs for not working miracles. No Government can do it. You cannot work miracles, but I have, I think, a legitimate cause for complaint and the cause of the complaint is precisely the cause of complaint that I and other Deputies had in 1950. We have, I think, more justly cause for complaint now in that I think I can say to Deputy Norton, the Minister and the Tánaiste — I think I can say legitimately to him — you had experience of this kind of thing when in Government before and was it the best thing and the wisest thing in the country's interest for you to adopt the same tactics? When I say 'you' I am speaking generally of the whole Coalition, because I think as regards what I have said to describe the preelection picture that it was all of one picture in regard to the main issue. I am asking, was it good tactics from [939] the point of view of the country as a whole, to have taken this approach, particularly in the experience of 1948 to 1951, and if you like in the experiences of 1951 to 1954? Deputy Larkin, in the course of what was, as usual, an interesting speech, said that the people were 'cynical'. I do not think I am misquoting him, because what he said was: 'They have had, during those years, a very bitter experience, and it is not unreasonable that they are somewhat cynical, that they have become somewhat tired trying to hold the tide out, as it were, between prices and their incomes, and they have become impatient with whatever Government is in power.' That quotation is taken from column 595 of the Dáil Debates of the 17th instant. I am afraid I have to agree with Deputy Larkin and, what is more, I am afraid that that is not a good situation for the country to be in. I would further like to see if we can get clear of that situation as fast as we can. I do not want to go back into past history, but there are Deputies in this House who even went back to the slaughtering of calves in 1932. Let us come a little closer up. I want to refer just slightly, with the permission of the Chair, to the period from 1948 to 1951, and I do so for two purposes: one is that I have been challenged to answer certain things on more than one front during this debate. I want to reply to these. The other is because it will help to show up to us certain factors that are at work in the situation in regard to prices that should prompt all of us to try and see what this problem is: to debate or try to analyse the actual steps that have to be taken like one step which was taken recently with which, I hope, before I finish, to deal as reasonably as I can with the Minister. What was the position? I, personally, came in for some criticism because it happened to fall to my lot in 1950 in this House — I have the actual records here — to point out where the [940] previous Coalition had fallen down on their promises. We have to-day the same Coalition in office as we had previously, if I may put it that way, because with the exception of one Party, which has virtually vanished from the political scene, it is the same Coalition as that which found itself in difficulty over prices at the end of 1950. They had, as a major plank of their programme in 1948, an urgent reduction in the cost of living. I have no doubt that there was a sincere desire to reduce the cost of living. Leaving sincerity out of the matter, I cannot conceive of any Government which could do as useful or as popular a thing as to reduce the cost of living neglecting to do it if it was in their power. They got into difficulty. We criticised them at the time. Incidentally, I take this opportunity of putting in what was then my defence and is now my defence. At that time, I was careful to point out — I have my own election literature here where the phrase occurs and it occurred in practically everything I said—that:— 'They are indicted now not for failing to do the impossible but for false promises, pretence and drift.' That is a quotation from the actual literature that was issued at the time by myself personally, and that particular approach will be found in all our pre-1951 literature. We pointed that out as fairly as we could. I grant you that we are not going to try to pretend that, in the heat of an election, any political Party is, shall I say, judicial, but we were careful in 1951. I challenge anyone to produce a statement of mine where I undertook to reduce the cost of living. I was talking for this Party at that time and so were others, and you will find constantly a reiteration of that statement that 'they are not indicted now for failing to do the impossible, but for false promises, pretence and drift.' We did say that there were false promises, particularly by Fine Gael, because they should have known that in regard to the undertakings which they were so freely making at that time. [941] Lest there should be any doubt about those undertakings, and seeing that, presumably, they have changed their policy since and their talk about the cost of living, let me recall what Deputy Mulcahy, as the Fine Gael Leader, said in January, 1948. His statement is reported in a newspaper friendly to the Fine Gael Party. He spoke as follows:— 'But Fine Gael is prepared to make one promise on a matter quite central in all our affairs. The high cost of living is the pressing problem of the day. Fine Gael proclaims that the problem can in a great degree be solved. Fine Gael promises to increase the purchasing power of the people's money.' Deputy Costello, the present Taoiseach, at approximately the same time, is reported in a newspaper as saying: 'Fine Gael had a policy which could deal with the urgent problem of the cost of living,' and so on. Now, it so happened that during that term of office, for a variety of reasons, the cost of a number of commodities went up and the cost of a number of articles — I still have the list here — went up. The point that I want to make on that is that there was a lesson. There was something that should make any prudent or thinking person hesitate before he gave undertakings. At that time, we realised that it would be quite unreasonable to attack the present Minister, who was then Minister for Social Welfare, and his colleagues, for not doing the impossible. I have a vivid recollection that when Deputy Cosgrave, who was then Parliamentary Secretary and is now Minister for External Affairs, made certain statements in this House and that when some of us answered him with a detailed list of prices, the present Tánaiste, although he was then Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare, rushed in and made a declaration about price control and the setting up of a body which was to control prices. I have no doubt that stimulated by the apparent urgency of the situation then — I think some of us called it panic at the time — there was a sincere intention to get a grip on this thing. [942] The record shows it was completely nugatory and that the factors at work were out of control. I have the whole record here, that is, if it is necessary to put it on record because much of it is on record already. The nugatory effect, the cancelling out of one factor against another, made the whole effort at that time futile. As I said, I am emphasising these things not by way of futilely going back into history, as that is no use, but by way of saying to the Minister that he should have known better when he was facing this problem this time. Secondly, I emphasise these things in answer to some of the things that were said in criticism of us. It has, completely and consistently for you might say three years now, been represented that we promised to keep down the cost of living before the election. We did not. Let me be equally frank and honest. After the election, there was a statement about subsidies which, if you like, you can very well criticise. You are entitled to do so. If we were aware of all the implications at that time, as we were not, perhaps some blame could have come this way. In the last election this same Government was formed very much on the basis as before — promises to reduce the cost of living. Frankly, I think they were very unwise. I do not think there is any use telling the ordinary people and the housewives now: 'Oh! we will hold it as it is', or: 'We have to deal with the situation as it is'. That, unfortunately, is the position in which you find yourself and the position in which the whole country finds itself. Much of that is without any fault of theirs any more than it is your fault or anybody else's fault in the country. There is a large body of people and housewives outside who thought that they had got such a promise. Deputy Dillon may be right. It all depends on one's interpretation of the facts. After all, the Labour Party are not the majority in the Government. They committed themselves but they are not the majority. Fine Gael disclaimed having made promises as I pointed out but whether they disclaimed or not [943] these people at the time they cast their votes were very much under the impression that they had got such a promise or were expecting to get a reduction in these commodities. Instead they find the situation going on in another way. I might, perhaps, be pardoned if I again refer to the quotation I have already taken from Deputy Larkin's speech and make the further remark that that is the reason they are cynical. But it will not help anybody to take that line in regard to it. Was it for a policy of keeping things as they were that this Government was elected? That is the next question. Was that why they were elected? Did the housewife vote to keep things as they were and show her disapproval by putting us out? There is a certain Deputy who is in the House at the moment who is fond of saying that they voted to put us out. That may be his view. Did the electorate who gave the votes that made the difference — 10 per cent. it has been reckoned by some — merely use their irritation over the 1952 Budget or did they do it in the expectation that they would put in some people who would go back to 1951? Whatever promises were made in the general election, the by-election campaign was all worked out in the city of Cork on the cry of: Back to 1951. Therefore, the question arises, can we get back to 1951? If we can and if the present Minister and Tánaiste can get back to 1951 prices without doing serious damage in any other vital direction, then I think we would be very discourteous to say the least of it not to congratulate him. It would be a petty attitude not to congratulate him. That is the question we should be discussing here. After all, in theory he can. He has the power. He says in his own election literature that he will reduce the price of food commodities by subsidies. All right. That is easy. He could go back to 1951 prices in the morning. Take that fundamental commodity, bread. By simply putting on the required subsidy he and his Department could calculate how much money he would require to put on that particular subsidy. Then, [944] of course, another problem arises and that is where the whole crux is. There is nothing to stop this Minister or any other Minister taking the millions of pounds required out of the Central Fund and allocating them to food subsidies and reduce the cost of bread and any other commodity you like right back to 1951 as far as that part of the operation is concerned. It is a perfectly simple budgetary operation. There is money there. I do not make any suggestion for a moment that the money is there when everything is taken into account. Generally speaking, there is plenty of money available to the Minister and the Government compared with the requirement under any single heading. They have only to give the appropriate sum for wheat or anything else and you are back to 1951. Naturally, any thinking person will say that this is elementary and the Minister may feel rather bored with my elementary approach to it if you like but a lot of clear, elementary thinking is no harm sometimes. Why does not this Minister or any other Minister do it? This Minister and this Government do not do it only because of one reason. The money has to be found and the money available to a Government can only come from the people's pockets in some form or another. If you are going to give more subsidies you will have to collect that money in some other form. Is not that the simple answer? Is not that the difficulty and the problem of this Minister and of any other Minister and Government that is there? Is not that the problem? Is not that the difficulty? At this stage, let me hasten to say that I am not criticising this Minister and Government for not working miracles. They cannot do it but I think I am in order if I say that after your experiences before, you should have known better and it was somewhat irresponsible of you, to put it mildly, whether by implication or explicitly, to promise the impossible. It is on that basis that I would put the indictment on that point. However, apart from indictments, let us just come to the specific problem of going back to 1951. [945] What can be done this year in regard to bread? After all, that is what matters and a realistic approach to such problems may help to get away from the cynicism which tends to bedevil the minds of the people — the cynicism to which Deputy Larkin refers. What can be done about this? We have a situation where the Minister for Agriculture reduced the price of wheat. Wheat was reduced in price and the farmer is getting less for his wheat. I think that the foreign price in regard to wheat would be favourable from the point of view of purchasers. Is is possible — those of us outside the Government and its advisers will not know the answer to the question until Budget time—is it possible that the Minister will be able to find the subsidy he promised from that source? In other words it is possible to increase the subsidy on bread to the towns and cities, say to Dublin City, by reducing the price to the farmers or by having the advantage of a reduced external price? As I say, I can only pose that as a question. It may be that intermediate costs will rise but we must assume that having Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce and in view of the statements of Deputy Larkin and another Deputy who emphasised that Deputy Larkin spoke authoritatively on behalf of the Labour Party, we can assume that profit-margins or anything of that nature do not enter into the picture, that there is going to be no absorption of differences in profits but there may be absorptions in costs of another nature, but taking everything into account, by and large, the question of the moment in regard to bread is this: If the foreign price of wheat is down, if our farmers are to get less, will it be possible to give the consumer in the towns the benefit? No doubt, if Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll were to have her way — I do not know whether she spoke authoritatively for the Labour Party or not — that would be an approach, but I do recognise that the Minister has stated in answer to questions that were relevant to this matter, that the matter does not clarify itself until harvest time of this year and that it is premature to make any [946] statement on it now. I have just gone over that ground to emphasise that I think it is in terms of such approaches we should be talking about things here. Quite obviously when it would come to that time we would be perfectly entitled to join issue on this again and some of us might legitimately, have differing views on it, and the ultimate answer might depend on a question of judgment, but a problem of this nature would pose itself then: Where is the just balance as between the price to the farmer of the wheat and the price to the consumer of the bread? People who would be purely concerned with the farmers would, no doubt complain — and no doubt have already complained — very bitterly about what the Minister for Agriculture and the Government have done about wheat. Senator McGee in County Louth — and he is no friend of this side of the House — has made no bones about that part of the issue, but on the other hand, if there was a benefit, if the reduced price to the farmers were to show itself in benefit to the consumers what would be the amount of the subsidy and therefore the effective reduction in the price of bread? Then it is a nice arguable point if you want to strike a balance. But again I think it is on such a level and on such matters we should be debating in this House and not sliding, as we so often do, into the subjective approaches of 'you said that' or 'I said this.' If there is a subjective approach here, again I say it is, to a certain extent, in self-defence. There are Deputies, and I could name a row of them, who start off their argument and try to turn it into a completely subjective type of attack on this Party. Very good. I think I am in order if I retaliate. If the level of things has sunk to that and if people outside are cynical, they have sunk to it because of the tactics — and I use responsibly the word 'irresponsible' approaches of the Parties which form the present Government while they were in Opposition. Getting away from the question of bread, we come to the question of butter. The way in which some Deputies talked here would suggest [947] that we were sorry that this Government had reduced the price of butter. You would think if you were to listen to them that we had some desire to keep prices up. I am afraid it was the desire of the Fianna Fáil Government to do the right thing by the country that earned them the unpopularity that undoubtedly they did earn. Deputies: Hear, hear! Major de Valera: I am glad to hear Deputies say 'hear, hear,' because when our Government did what it thought it should do, it came in for a measure of unpopularity. There is no doubt about it, and the propaganda which led up to the election largely hinged on that. But that was done because the Government at the time believed it was its duty to do it, because the Government found there was a financial position there which was becoming increasingly dangerous. I know the way in which we were attacked at that time. I was sitting over on those benches and I saw the glee, you might say, the joyful rubbing-of-hands, as they heard one burden after another coming out on the people in that Budget. Do you think we enjoyed it? I think I was one of the first speakers to get up and support that Budget. I think I was one of the very early speakers to follow the Minister and support him. Do you think I enjoyed it? Do you think I or any other member of the Government that framed that Budget enjoyed it? There were suggestions from the present Taoiseach and others here at that time that we were sadistic in rubbing it in, and I think the present Minister now listening to me rather indulged in that approach too, that we were enjoying it. There was also talk about a surplus of £10,000,000 unnecessarily put on, all of which proved to be so much hot air in the end, and so much so that if all the things that had been said at that time were correct, if everything that Deputy Costello and Deputy Norton at that time said were correct, there would be absolutely no excuse for them now that they are [948] Taoiseach and Tánaiste respectively for not having prices back to the 1951 level already. The trouble is that what they said was not correct and now they find themselves facing reality and their predecessors had to face reality. And the reality their predecessors had to face was the reality which arose from the drift in co-ordinating — the drift in the same Government that is there now — when in office before. I will excuse them inasmuch as it was their first experiment in inter-Party Government, and we know the stresses and strains that are there, but I do not think a repetition of such a situation would be so easily condoned now. I was talking about butter. That is what led me to say: Do you think that any responsible people are going to deplore the advantage that is given? I will give the Minister and his Government full credit for that in one sense. In another, I am wondering is it wise for a Government to do the type of thing they did? They simply hit on butter as one item before they got into office. It was taken in isolation without reference to the fiscal and other problems involved. It would be a very good thing if it could be done and if it could achieve the results it was designed to achieve. Nevertheless, I question whether it would not have been better to have co-ordinated that move in a general programme. The same remark goes for Deputy McGilligan's promise to give the back pay to the civil servants. I am not quarrelling with that in itself but, again, it was a thing done in a disjointed way — and we should have had some definite policy if definite policy there can be. Could there be a definite policy to deal with this question of prices, this question of the cost of commodities, the balance in regard to the consumer, which reminds me of a most significant and important part of Deputy Larkin's speech, the problem of the balance of incomes and living costs? Is there any policy by which we could approach this? Has the Government any positive policy to offer on this or is it going to be a question of dealing with problems as best we can as they arise? Has the Government got a definite policy for dealing with this question of [949] price control and the question of costs? For instance, the checking of the rise in the price of tea, the decrease in the price of butter, the giving to the civil servants of the back money, the reduction in the price of wheat to the farmers — are all these actions co-ordinated in pursuance of any particular policy? When I say definite policy, it is not enough to say: 'Our policy is to reduce prices.' I could demolish that statement very quickly. Is there a definite programme, a well-thought-out line of approach? If there is such a policy, could it be clearly defined so that we could grapple with the problems as they arise? That is a very relevant question. Fine Gael said they had a policy which could deal with the urgent problem of the cost of living. Just before the formation of the present Government, the Fine Gael Party issued a manifesto in which they purported to speak of a policy. Where is this policy? Is it going to be a repetition of 1950 all over again? I am beginning to wonder. On the policy in regard to prices, Deputy Larkin talks about the Prices Advisory Body and price control. What is our experience of price control? I know the Deputy is present and will correct me if I am wrong in the impression I got from his speech. I got the impression from Deputy Larkin's approach that he has come to the conclusion that the way to deal with this problem, as far as the actual level of prices is concerned, is to have some machinery such as a Prices Advisory Body or some quasi-judicial tribunal which will investigate the cost to the consumer and ensure that the consumer or public interest is adequately represented and in that way, strike the fairest balance that can be achieved between the consumer, the producer and whatever middle element there may necessarily be in the chain. I further got the impression — and again, if I am in any way misrepresenting the Deputy I would be only too eager that he should correct me — that the Deputy has come to the conclusion and that it is his approach that that would have to be a State body, a body governmentally controlled. If I am right in that, is it not fair [950] to ask just what has our experience been in regard to such controls in the past? We know that during the years of the emergency there was price control, that that, coupled with price control, there was wages control, but neither of these two controls proved very popular to say the least of it, that neither of these controls was altogether effective in their ultimate object and that by the end of emergency and particularly in the immediate 1946-47 transition period, we were all as anxious as we could be to get away from those controls. The co-operation of the organised trade unions had enabled the wages control end to be worked fairly smoothly and it was taken off smoothly with their co-operation. But the controls having been taken off, the prices problem became even more aggravated and the whole cry was for decontrol. Fine Gael were most vociferous in that regard. The Minister for Agriculture, then Deputy Dillon, intervened in debates on that question to say that he did not want Government interference or control. I confess that perhaps I am one of those who would be bracketed amongst those who are anxious to avoid central and governmental control as far as possible. The whole outcry was against it. The system did not work satisfactorily. There was a torrent of complaints that certain people were being penalised and only certain people were being caught. There was the abuse of smuggling. I think some Minister objected to a reference to that in connection with tea. Unfortunately, that is a problem that has to be taken very much into account and is one of the abuses that can occur. One of the big problems about control is: How can you make that control justly effective and ensure at the same time that it is not tyrannical and that it is generally fair? It will never be popular nor am I am going to put popularity up as an argument to Deputy Larkin. However, I will say this to Deputy Larkin — I am addressing my remarks rather to him than to others because I think he takes a more responsible approach than many [951] others. I would ask him, what system can you devise? How can you devise a workable system here that will be free from the abuses and the objections that attached to the efforts at that time? There was a policy of decontrol for which Deputy Lemass up to 1948 was severely attacked. My records show here very clearly that although there was talk about better price control in the 1947-48 General Election and as the policy of this Government when in office before, the whole trend of the policy of the Tánaiste and his colleagues in that Government was away from control. I think commodities were taken out of control by Deputy Norton's Government — it was Deputy Morrissey who was Minister at that time — just as fast as ever they were taken out. I asked a question at that time and in the answers that were given, I think, to other Deputies, there was a kind of suggestion that the Minister had no function now because during the past three years Deputy Lemass had decontrolled","","","","","","","","","",,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1
2949310,464,26,99,Aviation Policy: Statements (Resumed).,12/02/1998,Mr. Eamon Gilmore,The Workers' Party,Dún Laoghaire,"For the passenger, the biggest change in aviation over the past decade or so has been the dramatic fall in air fares. Credit for this is given to an active policy of deregulation in air travel, a policy pursued by the Government, Governments abroad and the EU. In Ireland, Ryanair was believed to represent the new, deregulated, highly competitive low fares air policy. The company's many fans, especially in politics and the media, argue that Ryanair's arrival in Irish aviation acted as a catalyst to the competition which, in turn, cut air fares. For example, the former leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, once pointed to Ryanair as a successful product of his party's policy on deregulation. In the fairytale version of the Ryanair story, the hero is a small new company in an unequal struggle against the giant State monopoly. The happy ending is a glorious success by a company which worked itself up the beanstalk by its own energy and with no State aid. Like all fairy tales, the truth is less heroic. The reality is that it has been Government policy for a long time to promote competition in aviation, which in practical terms has meant giving Ryanair repeated doses of favouritism. When Aer Lingus started its Dublin-Stansted service the then Government ordered the State owned airline off the route and gave Ryanair exclusive rights to the airport. The company was also give the exclusive rights to the Dublin-Liverpool and Dublin-Munich routes. It was the only airline allowed to fly between provincial airports and the UK. Money was made available to regional airports for route development to the UK from which Ryanair was the main beneficiary. It is widely believed that prior to 1994, Aer Rianta gave rebates on charges to the company which were not available to other airlines. A new business rebate scheme has meant that on routes such as Dublin-Birmingham, Ryanair is effectively paid a subsidy for every customer it takes from a competitor. Ryanair has done very well from the State and could not have succeeded without the assistance and favoured treatment which it received from successive Governments. I welcome the company's success and I hope it will continue to contribute to Irish aviation and our economy for a long time. However, Ryanair's unacceptable stand on the industrial dispute with its unionised baggage handlers will result in serious trouble for the company, for our aviation industry as a whole and the economy in general. Just as the arrival of Ryanair has marked the real beginning of deregulation, the company's dispute with its baggage handlers [292] is announcing the imminent departure of social partnership on the economy. Ryanair's success was facilitated by an economic and social climate over the past decade which is enshrined in an understanding between business, trade unions and Government and which is known as social partnership. The deal basically means that workers moderate their wage demands, avoid going on strike except as a last resort, that the industrial relations machinery such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission are used to settle disputes and that the Government and individual employers treat their workers fairly and with respect. Ryanair has broken the deal on every count. While low paid workers in Ryanair and elsewhere were making do with tiny increases in pay, the directors were stuffing themselves with bonuses plundered from their own company prior to flotation. The chief executive, Mr. Michael O'Leary, helped himself to £17 million over three years and the directors together took almost £24 million between 1995 and flotation. These bonuses alone would pay the wages of all the baggage handlers together for the remainder of their working lives. When the baggage handlers decided to seek the professional help of a trade union in having their pay examined what was the response of the company? It has refused to have the matters at issue put before the Labour Court and it has been responsible for a dispute which the baggage handlers tried to avoid and which is now becoming more bitter by the day. As for showing respect and fairness towards the workers concerned, the actions of the company have been deplorable. I have been told of abusive tirades from the chief executive directed towards striking workers, of demeaning comments towards union officials involved, of the use of private investigators to spy on individual workers and of old fashioned threats and inducements to get the workers back on the bags. If the baggage handlers were a group of workers in a key utility which had refused to go to the Labour Court and who had gone on strike for even a fraction of Mr. O'Leary's bonus there would have been a crescendo of outraged calls for a return to work and for respect for industrial relations procedures. However, where in this case are the evening paper headlines demanding that this greedy employer go to the Labour Court? The issues are serious and may get worse. If this dispute is escalated, as it may have to be, we will see a bigger disruption or even the closure of Dublin Airport. Must the travelling public and business suffer because Mr. O'Leary will not go to the Labour Court? What will be the implications for Irish aviation if the intermittent dispute in Ryanair becomes more generalised? Will somebody please cause this company to see sense before there is a major disruption to air transport on and off this island? The president of SIPTU, Mr. Jimmy Somers, has already warned that this dispute could result [293] in the end of social partnership. IBEC appears to think that he is bluffing. I do not believe so. Nobody should underestimate how easily and quickly social partnership could unravel for the trade unions. Already, many workers are frustrated that while they have kept their wages down in the national interest, the Michael O'Learys of the business world have helped themselves to the cream of economic success in their own self interest. Already there are signs of unofficial industrial actions and of a fractiousness among workers which will be difficult to manage if social partnership cannot even guarantee the constitutional right of workers to join a trade union. If the chief executive of Ryanair will not do business with a reasonable trade union official like Paul O'Sullivan of SIPTU how can social partnership be seen to be working? Ryanair's failure to honour social partnership will also pose difficulties for the company itself. Investors in the company would be well advised to give the company's performance on this dispute a closer examination. Resistance to trade union organisation may be business friendly in an environment where the relationship between trade unions and business is characterised by conflict. However, in our economy and industrial relations climate it ultimately results in loss and isolation for the company concerned. Even the use of senior management's time and energies in attempting to browbeat the unionised workers is misspent. Are the investors in Ryanair aware that the chief executive of their company is now spending his time in the baggage hall lugging bags and behaving like a champagne lout to his workers instead of addressing the new competitive challenges which are on the way in the Irish and European aviation industry? For example, the new no frills service recently launched by British Airways and which will no doubt be followed by other airlines is the real challenge facing Ryanair. Competition does not stand still and it has no sentiment for the Ryanair fairytale. Ryanair's success is not solely because of its low fares policy. The increase in air traffic, to which the Minister referred, has virtually trebled on Ireland UK and Ireland continental routes and has also contributed to its success. That is a function of increased economic activity in the country which has also been a product of social partnership. Ryanair is seriously misjudging the travelling public. In this country price is not the only determinant of consumer choice. Consumers have values and if a company is seen to be infringing fundamental rights and to be unfair consumers will turn away from it, no matter how many friends it says can travel free. Irish consumers will never sell their sense of fair play for low fares. In this dispute, Ryanair has refused to talk to the workers' chosen representatives, to go to the Labour Court and to listen to the Government's advice. We have a voluntary code of industrial relations so the company cannot be forced to [294] attend. In these circumstances, the travelling public, the Ryanair customers should take a stand. The company's workers need our support. The time has come for the public to boycott the company. People should refuse to travel with Ryanair until it goes to the Labour Court to settle the dispute. State bodies, companies and community, social and sporting organisations as well as individuals should place their travel business elsewhere as long as Ryanair insists on being an unfair airline. According to opinion polls, 91 per cent of the public supports the Ryanair workers' right to professional representation. The public should translate that support into the only language Ryanair management understands, a threat to its profits. People should boycott Ryanair until it treats its workers fairly. 'No rights, no flights, boycott Ryanair' should be the message until the company goes to the Labour Court and settles its dispute with the baggage handlers. By boycotting Ryanair, the public will ultimately help to settle the dispute. Another issue relates to the proposed open skies policy. I am surprised the Minister did not refer to this but perhaps she will do so later. I understand the European Union, in pursuit of its policy of liberalisation, has been in discussion with the United States authorities with regard to an open skies policy. If implemented, this will enable other airlines to operate transatlantic flights from Ireland. This obviously poses difficulties for Shannon Airport and Aer Lingus in terms of the competition they may face.",12/02/1998,28,103,104,a catalyst to the competition which in turn cut air fares For example the former leader of the Progressive Democrats,Deputy O'Malley,once pointed to Ryanair as a successful product of his party's policy on deregulation In the fairytale version of the,Deputy O'Malley,2949310_2,,a catalyst to the competition which in turn cut air fares For example the former leader of the Progressive Democrats Deputy O'Malley once pointed to Ryanair as a successful product of his party's policy on deregulation In the fairytale version of the,a catalyst to the competition which in turn cut air fares For example the former leader of the Progressive Democrats once pointed to Ryanair as a successful product of his party's policy on deregulation In the fairytale version of the,text639,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.118585412,0.002964635,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.614614615,0.585585586,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

2947244,1053,9,34,"Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997: Second Stage.",05/02/1998,Mr. David Stanton,Fine Gael,Cork East,"The Minister has recognised many things in the Bill so why can he not recognise that scheme? The home-school community liaison programme has been extremely successful and it should be expanded to include all schools as soon as possible. I agree with Deputy Kelleher that disadvantage is not confined to certain schools or areas. There are disadvantaged students in every school and there are different types of disadvantage. The home-school community liaison programme would also provide the link between primary and secondary schools to which Deputy Hanafin referred. There are areas where students leave primary school and do not enrol in secondary school but there is no mechanism to track them. Perhaps the Minister will take note of that point. The Bill states that boards of management will be established where practicable. That leaves an opt out clause for patrons and others who, if they do not agree with boards of management, may place obstacles in the way of their establishment. [1337] I suggest that the Minister strengthen the provision. I agree there may be isolated cases where boards of management cannot be established but I cannot recall one. In a democracy, it is important that boards of management be established in all schools. As it stands, the provision leaves an opt out clause which could benefit idiosyncratic people who do not like boards of management. The Bill makes no reference to gender balance in respect of boards of management. Perhaps the boards will be made up of all-male or all-female personnel. If nothing else, it would be useful to include a provision on gender balance as an aspiration which has been omitted since the publication of the previous Education Bill. I commend the Bill. The great changes in education came about as a result of my party's publication of the Just Society document in the 1960s which proved to be a major catalyst for change. One Minister for Education in the 1950s referred to himself as a 'dungaree man'. Deputy Hanafin reminded us that he stated 'You have your teachers and you have your schools but I am just the dungaree man hitting the knocks out of the pipes'. The Minister's colleague today christened him the 'silicon man'. I hope that was intended as a compliment.",05/02/1998,28,86,87,types of disadvantage The home-school community liaison programme would also provide the link between primary and secondary schools to which,Deputy Hanafin,referred There are areas where students leave primary school and do not enrol in secondary school but there is no,Deputy Hanafin,2947244_2,,types of disadvantage The home-school community liaison programme would also provide the link between primary and secondary schools to which Deputy Hanafin referred There are areas where students leave primary school and do not enrol in secondary school but there is no,types of disadvantage The home-school community liaison programme would also provide the link between primary and secondary schools to which referred There are areas where students leave primary school and do not enrol in secondary school but there is no,text90,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.288921459,0.007223036,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.863863864,0.810810811,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
3123190,515,9,142,Private Members' Business. - Ministerial Appointment: Motion.,23/05/2000,Mr. Jim Higgins,Fine Gael,Mayo East,"(Mayo): What hold has Mr. O'Flaherty on Fianna Fáil and on whom in Fianna Fáil that he has had to be rewarded with a European job with a salary of over three and a half times his generous £40,000 judicial pension? On numerous occasions, Fianna Fáil has shown utter contempt for the intelligence of the Irish people. It would be difficult, however, to find a more contemptuous or arrogant act than the appointment of Mr. O'Flaherty as vice-president of the European Investment Bank. Mr. O'Flaherty took an oath on taking office as Supreme Court judge in which he said: In the presence of Almighty God I, do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my [1038] knowledge and power execute the office of Judge without fear or favour, affection or ill-will towards any man, and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws. May God direct and sustain me. In the Sheedy affair, Mr. O'Flaherty drove a coach and four through his judicial oath of office. In spite of the oath, he showed quite extraordinary favour and affection towards Philip Sheedy. Not alone did he allow himself as a senior judicial figure to be approached on Mr. Sheedy's behalf – something a judge must never do and which flouts his very oath of office – he was responsible for setting in train a conspiracy and a scheme that was illegal and unconstitutional to have Mr. Sheedy illegally released from jail and, in so doing, he deliberately subverted the Constitution. According to Mr. O'Flaherty, he recalled a similar case over which he presided in the Court of Criminal Appeal and which he felt might assist the early release of Mr. Sheedy. The case in question was the DPP v McDonald. This is a totally misleading and fallacious argument and is nothing other than a transparent fig leaf which holds no water. The DPP v McDonald had nothing to do with reviewing sentences or relisting cases. It was not a reviewed sentence but an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and had no relevance to the Sheedy case. Mr. O'Flaherty subsequently summoned the county registrar to his judicial chambers. He mentioned the Sheedy case to him and suggested to Mr. Quinlan that it might be possible to have the case relisted in the Circuit Court. Mr. Quinlan, secure in the knowledge that he had the support and encouragement of one of the top judges on the bench, undertook to make the arrangements to have the Sheedy case returned to the Circuit Court. Small wonder that his reply to a query from Mr. Sheedy's solicitor as to what was going on elicited the comment, 'You don't want to know'. The rest is history. The case was wrongly listed. It was heard by Judge Cyril Kelly who should not have heard it. It was heard in the wrong court and should have been referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal or have gone for judicial review to the High Court. The case was called out of sequence – No. 1 instead of No. 19. Neither the DPP nor the Garda was notified. The case was called while the solicitor representing the Chief State Solicitor was out of court taking a telephone call. Judge Kelly pretended to the court that he had an up-to-date psychological report when this was patently not the case. The entire management of the case was illegal and unconstitutional from start to finish and Philip Sheedy was wrongly and illegally released from jail. Judge Kelly and Mr. Quinlan were forced to resign but the person who triggered the entire scandal was Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty. Had Mr. O'Flaherty not launched himself with so much enthusiasm into the Sheedy affair, had he not displayed such manifest judicial indiscretion, then [1039] Mr. Sheedy would not have been released and the probability is that the most unprecedented judicial scandal in the history of the State would have been avoided. Despite these facts, this is the man the Government has rewarded with one of the top and most lucrative positions in Europe. The courts are the cornerstone of democracy. By his actions and those of his colleague, Mr. Cyril Kelly, Mr. O'Flaherty has done irreparable damage to public confidence in the courts yet the Government is about to reward him with an annual salary of £147,000 and all the attendant perks. Mr. O'Flaherty wrote to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and offered to tell all but subsequently refused to come before the committee on the pretext that he was constitutionally prohibited. This is the man the Government is now going to reward with a £588,000 salary over a four year period on top of his judicial pension. On Friday, 16 April 1999, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the instruction of the Government, wrote to Hugh O'Flaherty and stated that the Government had decided at its meeting of that morning to forward the report of the Chief Justice to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The Minister went on to state that he had been asked to advise Mr. O'Flaherty that the Government would consider at its meeting of the following Tuesday, proposing resolutions for the consideration of the two Houses of the Oireachtas pursuant to Article 35. 4.1 for Mr. O'Flaherty's removal on the grounds that the facts admitted to the Chief Justice or established by him in his report amounted to misbehaviour within the meaning of the said provision of the Constitution. This was a situation in which Mr. O'Flaherty, a Supreme Court judge and a leading contender for the position of Chief Justice which was shortly to become vacant, was given a clear ultimatum by the Government to resign within four days for abusing his position and for stated misbehaviour or else the Government was going to have him unceremoniously booted from office. However, 13 months later the man deemed by the Government to be unfit and unworthy to be allowed to continue as a judge of the law courts is elevated to a top banking position where, presumably, a certain amount of judicial discretion will be involved. The report of the Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, made Mr. O'Flaherty's position as Supreme Court judge totally untenable. Mr. Hamilton, a senior judicial colleague who sat and served with Mr. O'Flaherty for many years, stated in the coldest possible terms that his colleague's intervention in the Sheedy affair was inappropriate and unwise. He could have gone further and stated that it was illegal and unconstitutional. However, his remarks were tantamount to saying so when he concluded that Mr. O'Flaherty's [1040] action was damaging to the administration of justice. Can one imagine a situation in which a judge who is solemnly and constitutionally obliged to administer justice is denounced by a colleague because his actions damaged the administration of the justice system he is supposed to uphold and maintain? In the 80 year history of the State a Supreme Court judge had never been forced to resign, yet this is the man the Government wants this House and the people to regard as competent and fit to hold an office with a much higher rate of pay than the position from which he was forced to resign. What is the real reason the Government stuck its neck out on this issue? Philip Sheedy was obviously somebody very special. Anyone whose early release from prison could have created the kind of constitutional convulsion which led to the fall of two well connected Fianna Fáil judges and a well connected Fianna Fáil county registrar is no ordinary individual. There is, of course, the Fianna Fáil agenda which runs through the case: Deputy Brian Lenihan's initial representations on behalf of Mr. Sheedy Senator Don Lydon's stale psychological report the Taoiseach's forever friend, builder Joe Burke, who visited Mr. Sheedy in Shelton Abbey prison, who had a business relationship with Mr. Sheedy and who was to be a witness in a court case in which Mr. Burke was involved and the Taoiseach's representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform looking for day release for Mr. Sheedy. The whole saga is riddled with politics and questions which must now be answered. This is not a case of unwarranted curiosity but of the public interest and the integrity of the judicial system. It is totally wrong to reinstate Mr. O'Flaherty to public office without insisting that he explain the full circumstances that led to his exit in disgrace from his previous public office. On 16 April, Mr. O'Flaherty was prepared to make a statement to the joint Oireachtas committee and to answer any and all questions surrounding the case. However, on 5 May he argued that the Constitution did not permit him to do so. Mr. O'Flaherty must think the people are fools. If there was no constitutional impediment on 16 April there was none on 5 May. Whatever about Mr. Kelly's position and the constitutional separation of powers, because he was, after all, sitting on the Bench and had heard the case, all the legal advice is to the effect that there was no constitutional problem with Mr. O'Flaherty coming before the committee. When he met Mr. Ken Anderson and Philip Sheedy's sister regarding the Sheedy case he was not exercising a judicial function but was exercising his dog in Herbert Park. The manner in which Deputy Harney and the Progressive Democrats are prepared to buy into this project has shocked ordinary decent people and elected members of that party. As Deputy Noonan said, this time last year the Progressive Democrats engaged in a Mexican stand-off [1041] because the Taoiseach had deceived the Tánaiste about his involvement and actions in the Sheedy affair. For several hours she and her party colleagues barricaded themselves behind closed doors in their Molesworth Street offices and continued to sulk until such time as the Taoiseach apologised to them. Now with Sheedy revisited she is prepared to back possibly the most scandalous act of political patronage and nepotism, which it is, because one must realise that Mr. O'Flaherty was very much part of the Fianna Fáil family.",23/05/2000,28,809,810,period on top of his judicial pension On Friday 16 April 1999 the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform,Deputy O'Donoghue,on the instruction of the Government wrote to Hugh O'Flaherty and stated that the Government had decided at its meeting,Deputy O'Donoghue,3123190_4,,period on top of his judicial pension On Friday 16 April 1999 the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform Deputy O'Donoghue on the instruction of the Government wrote to Hugh O'Flaherty and stated that the Government had decided at its meeting,period on top of his judicial pension On Friday 16 April 1999 the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform on the instruction of the Government wrote to Hugh O'Flaherty and stated that the Government had decided at its meeting,text557,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.356887126,0.008922178,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.910910911,0.861861862,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

800227,1075,8,88,Vote 57—Army Pensions (Resumed).,26/06/1952,Mr. Oscar Traynor,Fianna Fáil,Dublin North-East,"I find it rather difficult to reply to the various very sincere statements made in regard to appeals to further the interests of the Old I. R.A. I find it difficult for this reason, that, so far as I am concerned, practically all the questions discussed in this debate can be regarded as being sub judice, for the simple reason that there is on the agenda of the Government a memorandum dealing with the claims of the Old I. R.A. A circular has been widely circulated, not alone to members of the House but to practically every public man in the country. Not only am I aware, but every Deputy is aware, of the claims made [1725] in that pamphlet, which is entitled 'The Claims of the Old I. R.A.'. I met a deputation of the Old I. R.A. on this particular question and I was supplied with the necessary data which they circulated. When Deputies are talking in terms of generous treatment they should know that the cost of the claims would be very great. The first task which I felt was imposed upon me by the reception of this circular was to have it costed. That was my first duty. When it was costed by experts it was found to be somewhere in the region of £1,500,000. That is a very considerable sum of money and I think that Deputies would hardly expect the State to expend that vast sum in present circumstances. It would be necessary to find that money through taxes and I doubt if the House expects me or the Government to do that. Before dealing with what I might describe as the positive statements made in the House I think the best thing I could do would be to deal with statements which I might suggest were based on misconceptions. For instance, Deputy MacEoin stated that the pensions of serving personnel were held up for months on end pending the furnishing of clearance certificates. Now that statement is not correct. It is true that a certain amount of examination must be undertaken and that a period of perhaps a month is necessary for that examination, but I do not think that the period to which the Deputy referred has ever been reached. The longest period in that respect would be two months I do not think that two months has ever been exceeded. The Deputy also referred to a special allowances case in which a son's earnings as an apprentice plasterer were estimated at £234 a year. I think that Deputy Davin intervened then to say that he could not be a plasterer but must only be an apprentice plasterer. The sum referred to by Deputy MacEoin, £234, would be approximately £4 a week. I suggest that that is not an excessive sum at the present time for a young man who may have served a considerable portion of his apprenticeship. The Deputy described [1726] the assessment as incredible. Certainly if the social welfare officer examining that case found that that sum of money was going into the house I think he would be in duty bound to take notice of that fact. If the Deputy will establish to my satisfaction, however, that the report of the social welfare officer's examination dated the 15th May, 1952, was wrong in fact, I will have the refusal of the allowance reconsidered. Deputy MacEoin should know that in the case of a wound or disability pension a widow is entitled to an allowance or pension under the Acts provided, of course, that the pensioner during life had a married pension and that he died as a result of the wound or disease for which the pension was payable. Deputy Cosgrave was under a misapprehension regarding the pensions of serving personnel. They have been in existence since 1937, and every rank can ascertain his pension by consulting the relevant Order. What they do not know is the increased pension due to the increased pay. I can only say that I hope that Order will be published in due course. Deputy McGrath and later Deputy O'Higgins referred to the old age pension in relation to special allowances. The old age pension is not taken into account at all and anyone who argues on that ground is arguing on a misconception of the whole position. Under the Social Welfare Act, 1951, the old age pension of the applicant is not taken into account.",26/06/1952,14,682,683,due to the increased pay I can only say that I hope that Order will be published in due course,Deputy McGrath,and later Deputy O'Higgins referred to the old age pension in relation to special allowances The old age pension is,Deputy McGrath,800227_3,,due to the increased pay I can only say that I hope that Order will be published in due course Deputy McGrath and later Deputy O'Higgins referred to the old age pension in relation to special allowances The old age pension is,due to the increased pay I can only say that I hope that Order will be published in due course and later Deputy O'Higgins referred to the old age pension in relation to special allowances The old age pension is,text155,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.221359436,0.005533986,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.783783784,0.72972973,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

4045193,240,14,73,Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2009: Committee and Remaining Stages.,11/12/2009,Mr. Joe Costello,The Labour Party,Dublin Central,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in opposition to this section. It is at the heart of this budget. It is a shameless budget that directly attacks the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. The Green Party is beyond redemption in this matter. It does not seem to appreciate what is being done in its name. This will ring the death knell for Fianna Fáil, which at least traded in the past on being supportive of the less well off, the vulnerable, the poor and the sick. Now, it seems it has sold out everything to its high-flying financier, speculator, developer friends. It is people with disabilities, one-parent families, widows, carers, blind people and guardians who are affected by this section — the most vulnerable, the weakest, the poorest in our society. They have all been targeted with at least a €8. 30 cut. For young people aged 18 to 21, the jobseeker’s allowance has been halved and it has been reduced substantially for those aged 22 to 25. The intention is that these young people are unwanted. These are the future of Irish society. Does anyone think this Government wants to cherish them, to keep them here? No, it wants to get rid of them as quickly as possible. It wants them out of the country, it wants them to emigrate. That is exactly what is in this budget — target the weakest and get rid of those who might be some sort of a burden at present because there is no employment, and make sure they are got rid of as quickly as possible. When one combines this with the cut to the Christmas bonus, it will be a very bleak Christmas for those people who were hoping to have that little extra cheer that made Christmas decent for the many who spend the rest of the year in very difficult circumstances trying to make ends meet. It is still not too late to reconsider this. There are alternatives, such as in regard to the excise duty that has been reduced for alcohol, and in regard to the well off, who have not been targeted at all, and those identified by IBEC and The Sunday Business Post who had no reduction in their income in 2007 and 2008. All of the semi-State commercial sector, most of which has received increases, has not been targeted. Whole sectors of Irish society have not been targeted by this budget in any way. The most vulnerable sector and the public sector have been exclusively targeted. Fianna Fáil has sold its soul to those developers who were part and parcel of the Celtic tiger, and who Fianna Fáil cozied up to in the Galway tent and elsewhere. Now, we see it. When times get rough, they choose the simplest and easiest target that is available, and it is from this they are extracting all of the money to make the budget balance. There are Members on both sides of the House, including on the Government backbenches and among the Greens and Independents, who are not happy with this budget, which they find hard to stomach. Deputy Paul Gogarty at least has the decency to listen to the debate, although others do not. However, they are not happy with this budget. The point is that there is an alternative. These people did not realise, not being part and parcel of the dealings that went on, how the trade union movement was drawn down the garden path by Fianna Fáil and how the rug was then pulled from under it at the last moment, or how this budget is being rushed through before Christmas. All of this has put a lot of pressure on them and they did not realise and tease out the implications of it. It is being teased out in the best way possible at present. It is clear that this Bill attacks the most vulnerable sectors in society. From that point of view, it is impossible for any democrat to stand over and the fact there are alternatives makes it doubly impossible. If we do not hit these sectors at the bottom of the pile, there are other sectors at the top that can equally pay the amount of money and we can balance the budget in [349]that fashion. I appeal to these Members to realise that it is not too late. Deputy Gogarty and Deputy McDaid did not vote on the first vote, but a second vote is coming up in a short while. I would hope they will either abstain or vote against this. Others are questioning their consciences at this point. They should continue to do so until such time as the vote, and they should listen to the arguments that have been put across the floor of this House. They must see how threadbare is the Government’s argument on this issue. This section is at the heart of what the Government is doing, namely, pulling the rug from the poorest in our society and making life miserable for them. The Christmas bonus is gone and a reduction of approximately 6% will bring people on the poverty line below it, when we should be doing our best to ensure they are pulled up above the poverty line and assisted in whatever way possible. I make one final appeal. I do not believe there is any hope of getting the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs to redress his position. We heard him here this morning and he does not seem to care one way or the other. Certainly, there are good people on the backbenches, Independents and those who are semi-detached — the strays, as the leader of the Labour Party described them this morning — and some among the Green Party who are deeply worried about this measure. This is the opportunity for them to take a stand on this section, whatever about the other sections. I appeal to them to do so when the vote arises.",11/12/2009,30,446,447,Fianna Fáil has sold its soul to those developers who were part and parcel of the Celtic tiger and who,Fianna Fáil,cozied up to in the Galway tent and elsewhere Now we see it When times get rough they choose the,Fianna Fáil,4045193_4,,Fianna Fáil has sold its soul to those developers who were part and parcel of the Celtic tiger and who Fianna Fáil cozied up to in the Galway tent and elsewhere Now we see it When times get rough they choose the,Fianna Fáil has sold its soul to those developers who were part and parcel of the Celtic tiger and who cozied up to in the Galway tent and elsewhere Now we see it When times get rough they choose the,text242,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,0.085895569,0.002147389,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.555555556,0.534534535,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,0
4400270,693,8,43,Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements (Continued),12/12/2012,Mr. Micheál Martin,Fianna Fáil,Cork South-Central,"The case for a lifting of the burden of much of Ireland's bank related debt is rarely aired in public by the Taoiseach beyond generalities. An exception to this rule was made by him in October, when he said: 'Ireland was the first and only country which had a European position imposed upon it in the sense that there wasn't the opportunity, if the government so wished, to do it their way by burning bondholders.' That is a powerful argument, because it is true. However, the Government has used it very rarely. It has preferred to keep up with empty political talking points. It prefers to keep up the claim of a bad deal, because saying it was the acceptance of an imposed position with no alternative available does not get the backbenchers excited. The main tactic the Taoiseach has adopted at Council meetings so far has been to hope that something turns up. The ongoing Greek crisis has meant that on two occasions, significant interest rate cuts have been made available to all countries. In June, pressures applied by Spain won agreement to the principle of European financing of bank-related debt and a resolution regime which allows the burning of bondholders. The fact Ireland was not expecting or pushing for anything then was shown by the fact that the Tánaiste flew home early and had to do his interviews claiming credit for the deal in Dublin. As matters stand today, the public has no idea of what is being sought by the Government. The goalposts have been moved so often that there is now no doubt that the priority is to ensure the Government can claim whatever emerges as a victory. This is probably the major reason behind the failure to set out a definition of debt sustainability. We have just had a budget announced, but not one Member of Government has been willing to say what he or she believes is a sustainable level for our debt. The promissory notes were structured in such a way that the interest returns to the State through our Central Bank. At the moment, it is the principle that matters and this is a burden too heavy for us to bear. Due to the way the notes were structured, a subsequent negotiation was always required. However that appears to have started seriously only in recent months. Last year's proposed technical paper - does the Taoiseach remember that, I think he got a year out of it? - never appeared and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, moved on to talking about selling bank shares to the ESM before he abandoned that as well. Without a major deal, which we believe is justifiable, next year a further €3. 1 billion will be converted from promissory notes into normal interest-bearing Government bonds. This will continue for ten years, by which time there will be nothing left but the full incorporation of all bank related debt into our sovereign debt at market rates. This matters more today than it did a week ago, because we now have evidence that the Government is missing its budgetary targets. Its decisions have pushed down confidence, growth, revenue and employment. Its Ministers have failed to deliver on spending commitments, with the Department controlling the largest discretionary budget in chaos and controlled by a man whose colleagues brief against him daily. Without a significant deal on the promissory notes, the suppressed revenue and overspending revealed last week will require increased adjustments. Given how these issues have been handled so far, they will further depress the economy and increase unfairness. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, is a man who has a career-long commitment to trying to shake foundations with his words, irrespective of the facts lying behind these words. He was at this again on Sunday, with his claims that the Government 'has no intention of paying the promissory note', saying 'we didn't pay it this year'. Extraordinarily, the Tánaiste repeated most of these words yesterday in Brussels, although I am aware the Taoiseach took a different tack. Not only did the Government pay the promissory note this year, but the ECB issued a press release praising it for paying it in full and on time. What the Government did was convert the note into a 12-month bond, bought by the Bank of Ireland, with the Government paying the Bank of Ireland millions in profits. Because of the subterfuge used by the Government in trying to manipulate media coverage, it took a while for this to be spotted. If this is what Labour Party Ministers define as not paying it, they are fooling no one. Given how Labour's way was abandoned even before the Government was formed, the idea that the Tánaiste and his predecessor as leader are getting tough has been dismissed. At best, it is believed they are trying to talk up their role in a deal they feel may be on the way. Because the Government has refused to publish any technical papers about what it is seeking, finance experts have been left to patch together ideas. Professor Karl Whelan of Trinity College, who has been consistently ahead of Ministers in understanding the operation of the promissory notes, has estimated that over half of the burden of redeeming the notes and converting them into standard sovereign debt could be lifted in certain circumstances. Given the role that Ireland played in being willing to act in the interests of the wider eurozone, we deserve a concrete lessening of the burden of the debts we took at a critical moment. Without this, our fiscal consolidation may be deeply undermined. I believe there will be a deal on the promissory note and that if it is based on principles which have been agreed by Europe's leaders under pressure from other countries, it will make a significant difference to our budget. It is time for the Taoiseach and the Government to put aside the public relations posturing and to be open with the people. They should publish the documentation they have submitted to the ECB and tell us what they believe is a sustainable level of debt and what they believe Ireland is entitled to out of fairness. If the policy continues to be to say as little as possible and to claim everything as a victory, there will be very negative reactions, and not just from the Irish people. The Presidents of both the Commission and the Council have produced documents concerning the reform of economic and monetary union, and President Van Rompuy's more limited vision is the one which is now on the table. It is not good enough and the timetable is ridiculous. Even the man who first proposed EMU, Jacques Delors, has talked about the fundamental flaws in the euro which helped cause this crisis. Most of these flaws require changes to the European treaties. Yet, according to the draft conclusions for this week's summit, no such changes will be prepared for at least two years. The communique states that a 'common stabilisation function', which is new jargon for actions capable of helping countries in economic difficulties, will not be discussed until after the next European Commission takes office in late 2014. How can this be a credible response to a crisis which has seen unemployment grow to nearly 19 million people? How can it give confidence to investors who fear that governments do not have the commitment to get Europe back to real growth? It is long past time for the Taoiseach to set out the reforms Ireland wants to see implemented. The policy of supporting anything, as long as there is no referendum must end. The summit will also issue conclusions relating to the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP. The draft states that the pooling and sharing of military capabilities should be pushed forward and it is quite assertive in developing this dimension of the Union's work. While there is nothing to indicate this, I assume the Taoiseach has already said that we do not want to pool or share many of the defence capabilities of other states. I hope the Taoiseach will clarify this in his response. Nothing will be decided until next December, but we should set out now that we do not thing that the development of the CSDP is a priority and that the case for significant development has not been made. Recent changes to the treaties should be given time to bed down. Let us see how the European Union works in this area and, in particular, let us see if it can develop itself successfully as a support to the United Nations. With regard to foreign policy, the summit should set out a strong and united EU position in opposition to the outrageous behaviour of the Netanyahu government in pushing ahead with escalated settlement building. This is a highly provocative move, without any regard to UN resolutions, the European Union, the US position or international law, which sets back any prospect for meaningful talks towards a durable peace process and settlement.",12/12/2012,31,604,605,handled so far they will further depress the economy and increase unfairness The Minister for Communications Energy and Natural Resources,Deputy Rabbitte,is a man who has a career-long commitment to trying to shake foundations with his words irrespective of the facts,Deputy Rabbitte,4400270_2,,handled so far they will further depress the economy and increase unfairness The Minister for Communications Energy and Natural Resources Deputy Rabbitte is a man who has a career-long commitment to trying to shake foundations with his words irrespective of the facts,handled so far they will further depress the economy and increase unfairness The Minister for Communications Energy and Natural Resources is a man who has a career-long commitment to trying to shake foundations with his words irrespective of the facts,text916,3,2,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-0.336472237,-0.008411806,0.03904344,0.000976086,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.232232232,0.232232232,0.468468468,0.461461461,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,0

Following the recent tragic events in London I and my officials have maintained regular contact with Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry in an ongoing assessment of the situation. Specifically, I addressed a joint Bord Fáilte-Northern Ireland Tourist Board workshop in London on 15 February 1996 and met many of the 100 Irish and 300 British trade representatives in attendance. I also spoke at the Irish Hotels Federation annual conference on 20 February 1996 at which I met many hoteliers from all parts of Ireland. We cannot deny that the London bombings have come at an important time of the year for generating visitors for the coming season and that these events will impact to some extent on our capacity to attract overseas visitors this year. It is important, however, that we do not talk ourselves into believing that Irish tourism is facing a crisis as a result of these incidents. Before the very welcome ceasefires of late 1994, Irish tourism was growing at a fast rate. There are underlying strengths in the Irish tourism industry which have been built up over many years through investment in our product, increased marketing resources, improved air and sea access and the general climate of competitiveness which can be found in the economy. I am confident that these underlying strengths will continue to serve us well in 1996. The monitoring of overseas markets which Bord Fáilte has been carrying out [242] since 9 February 1996 indicates that to date there has been a very limited reaction among customers in key markets. The general trend, and I would stress that this is an evolving situation, is that in continental European markets there has been no noticeable drop in inquiry levels in the United States inquiries are still running at very good levels and in Britain, the picture is more mixed with some operators reporting some falling off in inquiries while others have experienced no downturn. It is clear, therefore, that in the immediate aftermath of the horrific incidents such as we have seen in London there is evidence of a small number of cancellations, but I am advised that within the context of the overall numbers of bookings for holidays in Ireland, the numbers are insignificant. I strongly caution Deputies that the interests of Irish tourism will not be served by having the subject of cancellations, limited as they are, highlighted to an undue degree. I have no doubt but that some of Ireland's competitors for international tourism business could only benefit if a perception was to be fostered in the international media that we were suffering large scale cancellations. Those who would be tempted to prophesise such a scenario could find that their prophesy becomes self-fulfilling. The main consumer marketing campaigns in our overseas markets are carried out under the aegis of the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative which is a partnership between the tourism industry and the State sector, North and South. I understand that in the immediate aftermath of the bombings in London, some television advertising in Britain and the US was rescheduled in the interests of reacting sensitively to the situation. Press advertising is continuing in these markets and no changes have been made to the media and promotional campaigns in other markets. The question of resuming TV advertising is entirely a matter for the OTMI board. The board is monitoring the situation closely with a view to resuming at the earliest possible and appropriate [243] time. I understand they will be resumed tomorrow, 28 February. At this stage the question of devising appropriate strategies to deal with the new situation is being considered by the OTMI board and Bord Fáilte. I am satisfied that the substantial resources which I have made available in 1996 for marketing activities are sufficient. I am happy to leave the tactical application of those resources to those with the knowledge of the markets and the expertise in the most appropriate mechanisms for marketing our tourism product. In her question, Deputy Coughlan asked about the potential for marketing Ulster as a region. Consumer research carried out for Bord Fáilte and the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative has shown that potential visitors to Ireland from overseas think of Ireland as a complete entity in tourism terms and do not readily respond to messages which are specific to any one geographical region. In line with this research, the thrust of the OTMI's marketing campaigns is to market and advertise Ireland as an overall destination product. There is already a good working relationship between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and this will have its most practical marketing manifestation in the 1996 OTMI, in which the NITB is an active participant. The peace process has encouraged North-South co-operation in the area of tourism to develop at a significant pace and as new areas of common interest are identified, I will ensure that there will be no lack of willingness on our part to participate in further joint marketing activities. I hope that in this lengthy reply I have assured Deputies that the tourism industry is a strong and resilient sector and that it is responding to recent events in a calm and considered manner.",27/02/1996,27,679,680,knowledge of the markets and the expertise in the most appropriate mechanisms for marketing our tourism product In her question,Deputy Coughlan,asked about the potential for marketing Ulster as a region Consumer research carried out for Bord Fáilte and the Overseas,Deputy Coughlan,2818881_1,,knowledge of the markets and the expertise in the most appropriate mechanisms for marketing our tourism product In her question Deputy Coughlan asked about the potential for marketing Ulster as a region Consumer research carried out for Bord Fáilte and the Overseas,knowledge of the markets and the expertise in the most appropriate mechanisms for marketing our tourism product In her question asked about the potential for marketing Ulster as a region Consumer research carried out for Bord Fáilte and the Overseas,text555,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.468521286,0.011713032,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.951951952,0.908908909,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

4065860,986,26,93,Adjournment Debate - School Staffing.,16/02/2010,Mr. Pat Rabbitte,The Workers' Party,Dublin South-West,"I understand that, in the current climate, it is necessary to make both savings and cuts. However, it is indefensible to suggest that those savings and cuts should be made on the backs of the most vulnerable in society. I intend no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, when I agree with the assertion on the part of Deputy Brian Hayes that the Minister for Education and Science should be present. I sincerely hope the Minister of State will not read out a script supplied by the Department of Education and Science which mirrors the contents of a letter I received earlier today from the Minister for Education and Science. The relevant sentence in that letter reads, 'There is absolutely no question of SNA posts being removed from schools where they continue to meet the scheme’s criteria'. It is the latter phrase which undermines any value the letter might have. The NCSE is going to find that St. Joseph’s does not meet the scheme’s criteria. As the principal in the school has made plain, it is not possible to measure mild learning disability merely by [307]ticking one box. There are many factors that constitute learning disability in these circumstances. This school has an outstanding record. The parents fought over the years to make it the type of school it is today. It is unthinkable that the Minister should intervene in the middle of the school year and impose cuts like this. I join with Deputy Brian Hayes in pleading with the Minister to defer consideration of these cuts until there is an opportunity to sit down with the Minister, because it is the Minister and not some quango who has the power — by making one telephone call — to stop this from happening to St. Joseph’s Special School at Balrothery in Tallaght.",16/02/2010,30,49,50,be made on the backs of the most vulnerable in society I intend no disrespect to the Minister of State,Deputy Moloney,when I agree with the assertion on the part of Deputy Brian Hayes that the Minister for Education and Science,Deputy Moloney,4065860_1,,be made on the backs of the most vulnerable in society I intend no disrespect to the Minister of State Deputy Moloney when I agree with the assertion on the part of Deputy Brian Hayes that the Minister for Education and Science,be made on the backs of the most vulnerable in society I intend no disrespect to the Minister of State when I agree with the assertion on the part of Deputy Brian Hayes that the Minister for Education and Science,text793,2,2,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.055339859,0.001383496,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.500500501,0.488488488,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
1524602,777,8,92,"Garda S&iacute och&aacute na Bill, 1971—Second Stage (Resumed).",08/02/1972,Mr. Séan Moore,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South-East,"This Bill gives us an opportunity of paying a tribute to the Garda and also of helping to remove any grievances they have. We shall never have the perfect force any more than the perfect society but we must deal with any legitimate grievances the Garda may have if we are to be easy in our own consciences. Before proceeding I should like to question whether ban-ghardaí are included in the Bill. I do not see any mention of them, but if they are, then I suppose that in the foreseeable future we can look forward to seeing a female Commissioner of the Garda. I do not say that in support of women's lib. but in consideration of the fact that it is only in the past ten or 12 years we [1267] have had a force of women police, and I take this opportunity of complimenting them on the work they have done since they were recruited. However, I have always been very critical of certain work they were given to do which was never envisaged by those of us who advocated the recruitment of banghardaí. In the early days, for instance, I saw a ban-gharda directing traffic which to my mind was inappropriate Deputy O'Connell mentioned that we should have more traffic lights, which I suppose is a very good idea. Nevertheless, I do not think you can replace, by artificial means, the garda in the city, the dedicated man who joins the force because he feels that this is his calling. Gone is the old conception of the six-footer plodding his way along the street and representing law in the area. There were many good points about having the man on the beat and possibly we would be better off if we still had this type of patrol. However, in Dublin city alone there are approximately 700 miles of streets and this would require an inordinate number of gardaí. We should be able to have the happy medium where we would see gardaí on the beat in O'Connell Street and Grafton Street, something which one sees very seldom now. Itinerant children are sent to sit on O'Connell Bridge in fierce weather and one feels that by having them removed one is doing them an injustice. The gardaí should get after the people who put those children there in all weathers. About two years ago I crossed the bridge at about one o'clock in the morning and saw a couple, I presume the father and mother of the children who were going to sit on the bridge at that hour.",08/02/1972,19,206,207,of banghardaí In the early days for instance I saw a ban-gharda directing traffic which to my mind was inappropriate,Deputy O'Connell,mentioned that we should have more traffic lights which I suppose is a very good idea Nevertheless I do not,Deputy O'Connell,1524602_1,,of banghardaí In the early days for instance I saw a ban-gharda directing traffic which to my mind was inappropriate Deputy O'Connell mentioned that we should have more traffic lights which I suppose is a very good idea Nevertheless I do not,of banghardaí In the early days for instance I saw a ban-gharda directing traffic which to my mind was inappropriate mentioned that we should have more traffic lights which I suppose is a very good idea Nevertheless I do not,text764,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.240507593,-0.00601269,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.095095095,0.123123123,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0

4117604,2180,9,84,Patient Safety: Motion,29/06/2010,Dr. James Reilly,Fine Gael,Dublin North,"The wording of the motion I have moved deserves to be emphasised, particularly the section in which we call on the Government to establish a patient safety authority to ensure 'investigations take place when and where' necessary. As things stand, such an authority is not being established, unfortunately. We are having this debate on foot of another serious scandal — the misdiagnosis of miscarriage in pregnant women, which is mentioned in the motion. This problem has emanated from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which has been beset by difficulties and scandals over the years. In recent times, the serious pressure on the hospital has become even more horrendous as a result of the Government’s deliberate policy of stripping essential services from hospitals in the surrounding counties and moving them to Drogheda. This approach is making it more difficult for the staff of the hospital, who have an increased workload, to carry out their duties with any degree of safety. I wish to give an example of the problems encountered during foetal assessments. A lady told me that the person who performed the ultrasound on her was bleeped on three separate occasions during the course of the short examination. Anybody who knows anything about learning knows that concentration is important. We all know that anxiety interferes with concentration. If a bleep goes off in one’s pocket, it is not just distracting — it creates anxiety too. One will be distracted while one performs this important examination if one is aware that somebody is in great trouble and needs one’s services. It is important to remind the House what happened to Melissa Redmond. Eight weeks into her pregnancy, on 22 July 2009, Melissa Redmond went for a scan in the early pregnancy unit [818]of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. It should have been an occasion of joy and hope, but instead it was a devastating experience. She was advised that her unborn baby was dead, eight weeks into her pregnancy. A dilation and curettage procedure was arranged for two days later, on 24 July 2009, and she was given an abortive drug to take on the morning of the operation. The drug in question is designed to open the neck of the womb to make the procedure easier. We must bear in mind that a dilation and curettage procedure involves the evacuation of the contents of the womb. If there is a live foetus in the womb, its life will be terminated as part of the procedure. A report on TV3 last night referred to an extraordinary case in which a probable twin survived a dilation and curettage procedure. That is highly unusual. Fortunately, Melissa Redmond had sufficient strength of character to seek a second opinion. In that context, I will speak later about the gross unfairness in our system. As she had already had two children and suffered four miscarriages, she was not prepared to allow matters to rest there. She went to her general practitioner in Donabate, who gave her another scan, which found that the baby was alive. The baby was born healthy, thankfully, and is now alive and well. I am sure the Redmonds would have nothing but good to say about the staff who looked after Melissa for the rest of her pregnancy, subsequent to events at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. After the story broke, the HSE said the wrong diagnosis of miscarriage, such as that in this case at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, was 'extremely rare'. This was contradicted by women who came forward with similar experiences over the following days. To date, approximately a dozen women have told stories of wrongly being informed by maternity hospitals that their babies had been miscarried, only to give birth to healthy infants at a later stage. The HSE has received almost 300 telephone calls from concerned women and their families about the treatment they received in maternity hospitals throughout the country. It is important to remind the House that when different people make the same mistake in different locations, there is a problem with the system. If the same person makes the same mistake, clearly there is a problem with the person. Nobody should doubt not only that we have a problem with our system, but also that we have a problem with who runs the system. This problem was not addressed immediately to ascertain its prevalence. We had to depend on brave and strong people like Melissa and Michael Redmond, who were prepared to forego their privacy and to let the country know, through the media, what happened to them. This resulted in other women coming forward with their stories. Although we realise we have a problem that requires investigation, the Minister for Health and Children will not order an independent investigation. The Minister, Deputy Harney, wants the HSE to investigate the HSE. She has been a stalwart proponent of not allowing the medical profession to investigate the medical profession, or the dental profession to investigate the dental profession. I agree with her that the days when any profession or group — the Garda or other body — was allowed to investigate itself are over. We need third party verification. We need to be assured that those conducting investigations do not have any conflict of interest. There have been other cases of misdiagnosis. Martha O’Neill Brennan from Galway told her story. In both these cases, the women trusted their instincts, stood up to the system and insisted on a second scan. Both are right and both have since given birth to healthy babies. Michael and Melissa Redmond have since said they were disgusted by the HSE’s reaction to the misdiagnosis. [819]An internal review showed that the equipment was faulty and the facilities inadequate. The inquiry found that the image resolution on the ultrasound machine in the early pregnancy assessment unit was not adequate to accurately assess early pregnancies and their complications and that the machine displayed evidence of fatigue. The internal review recommended that the equipment be updated to ensure it was fit for purpose. Despite this, the scanner continued to be used until January 2010, six months after the incident. The review also suggested that a dedicated ultrasonographer be recruited to the unit. One year on, that position has still not been filled. What is the recommendation from this, so called, independent HSE report? It is that we get a sonographer for four hours a day. This maternity unit delivered more than 4,000 babies last year. By any international standard, having spoken to professionals in this area, there should be at least two, if not four, whole-time equivalent sonographers available and not the proposed half-time equivalent, who still is not present. This puts me in mind of the self serving system the HSE has become. It looks to itself and its own convenience before it looks to patient care. I congratulate the Redmond family of Donabate and others who have come forward with their experiences. It is not fair to expect devastated couples, who have just been told they have lost their unborn child, to have the composure, confidence and courage to demand a second opinion. It should happen as a right. A patient centred service would listen and ask. Our service thinks only of the inconvenience to itself, as encapsulated by another woman who told of asking, when she was on her way to have a D and C, for a second scan. She was told that was not possible. When she continued to insist she was further informed that not alone was it not possible but that if she did not stop insisting she would miss her slot in the queue and would not have her D and C for another week. Is this a demonstration of compassion, of caring or of a patient centred service? The ethos of the HSE has become something horrible and not something of which anyone in this Chamber can be proud. I can give example after example of that. Meanwhile, the HSE has announced it is developing national guidelines for clinical practice in obstetrics care. It has announced the establishment of a miscarriage diagnosis review to examine the cases known or identified in the past five years. The review has subsequently expanded to cases beyond five years. While we recognise and welcome the decision of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland to develop its own guidelines in conjunction with the HSE so that it will standardise practices at a high level and welcome the announcement of the HSE review, this is not enough. The Minister for Health and Children and the HSE must call on HIQA to conduct an urgent audit of ante-natal and maternity services, including the standard and safety of equipment, staff workloads and the workload on equipment, care protocols and training of personnel. This is critical. I am given to understand there are not many more than 120 ultrasound machines involved in foetal assessment. How long could it take to assess those? A year after this matter arose privately between the hospital and Melissa Redmond — the HSE was aware of it — this has not happened. The lethargic, lazy approach of the HSE to these issues, which are so important to patient care, is not acceptable. Matters are put on the long finger and patients are left at risk, instead of urgent action being taken as would happen in a proper patient centred service rather than the self service system we have. We call on the Government to establish a dedicated independent patient safety authority that would incorporate HIQA, reassure patients that they have a safe place to go with their complaint, act as an advocate for them and ensure that investigations take place when and where necessary. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has had an unfortunate history. It has been mired in a series of scandals and controversies, many of which centred on the standard of care given to pregnant [820]women. Given the number of scandals, one would expect the hospital to be extra vigilant when dealing with patient safety and care. Instead of this, patients attending Drogheda and other hospitals around the country often feel let down and ignored by the system. Do I need to remind Members of what has happened in this hospital and how people in the north east of the country have been let down? I know I do not have to remind my colleague, Deputy Fergus O’Dowd. The disgraced obstetrician Dr. Michael Neary was struck off the medical register in 2003 after an investigation found he had needlessly removed the wombs and ovaries of dozens of expectant mothers. Garda Sergeant Tania Corcoran-McCabe died, along with one of her twins. An inquest returned a verdict of death by medical misadventure in relation to the young mother. I sympathise with her family. Symphysiotomy procedures were carried out there long after the practice had ceased elsewhere. Mother Kathleen Naughton, who is still living with the consequences of the symphysiotomy she underwent there 35 years ago, said doctors at the time considered themselves to be 'gods'. There was also the terrible case of abuse by Michael Shine. We now know the great work done by Dignity for Patients. Would these groups need to exist if a patient safety authority had been in place? Would medical people have been allowed to continue with their practices had a patient safety authority existed, which would have been an advocate for complainants and would have been independent and not employed by the hospital? Complaints officers in the hospitals are employees of the hospital. Where does their loyalty lie? Thousands of X-rays had to be reviewed after a locum radiologist mistakenly gave the all-clear to nine lung cancer patients, eight of whom subsequently died. The radiologist worked at Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda and Our Lady’s Hospital in Navan between August 2006 and August 2007. How did the HSE react? It knew about it. My colleague, Deputy Fergus O’Dowd, through a freedom of information request, established that the HSE knew about this real danger to patients in September 2007 and took no action until May 2008. This lazy, lethargic approach screamed at patients, 'We’ll deal with you when we are ready. In the meantime, you take your chances.' I will now refer to Portlaoise and the disgraceful situation where a consultant surgeon, having reviewed the files in fives and sixes, gave them to an official who put them in a room and left them there until a 'cohort' was reached. What was the cohort to be? Was it 100 or 200? It did not matter that these women might have had breast cancer — some did. That was not the issue. The system would deal with these people when it was good and ready. That is not the system in which I grew up or was trained. It is not the system that pertained prior to the installation of the HSE. In Tallaght, a local general practitioner highlighted the X-ray issue in April. The HIQA became involved in June. It interviewed people in August and in December the Minister was informed. She was not told the extent of the problem and she did not ask because she did not want to know. Months went by before the issue was properly addressed. Once a problem was acknowledged and recognised, all the X-rays — which were digital — could have been e-mailed to radiologists throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom and the matter could have been resolved within weeks. Instead, it was left on the long finger because, once again, the system served itself, and the patient was left to wait. I wish to mention, in particular, the tragedy in Ennis Hospital, where Ann Moriarty twice attended and was given the all-clear. She also went to St. James’s Hospital and was again given the all-clear. The Minister stated last week that HIQA could be the patients’ safety authority. HIQA has told me it cannot be a patient safety advocacy. However, it could be subsumed into a patient safety authority. I would like to talk about all the other matters on which it could advise and [821]over which it could preside. Will we find ourselves here again talking about the plight of our young people with cystic fibrosis who still have no isolation unit? They were promised one would be built this year but it has not yet even been tendered for properly. All the issues I spoke of would have come to light earlier if a patient safety authority were in place. Consider the situation people must go through in seeking redress for their hurt young, having to mortgage their homes to get justice for their children. I urge the Minister not to miss this opportunity to instruct HIQA to undertake an investigation and give people back faith in their health service. They do not trust the HSE and a HSE investigation will not do it for them. I would like to see an audit of our maternity and ante-natal hospital services performed by HIQA but, most of all, I plead with the Minister to take this opportunity to set up a patient safety authority and restore some faith in our health service.",29/06/2010,30,2005,2007,Hospital in Navan between August 2006 and August 2007 How did the HSE react It knew about it My colleague,Deputy Fergus O'Dowd,through a freedom of information request established that the HSE knew about this real danger to patients in September 2007,Deputy Fergus O'Dowd,4117604_4,,Hospital in Navan between August 2006 and August 2007 How did the HSE react It knew about it My colleague Deputy Fergus O'Dowd through a freedom of information request established that the HSE knew about this real danger to patients in September 2007,Hospital in Navan between August 2006 and August 2007 How did the HSE react It knew about it My colleague through a freedom of information request established that the HSE knew about this real danger to patients in September 2007,text936,1,2,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.510825624,0.012770641,0.032879797,0.000821995,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.592592593,0.465465465,0.457457457,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
2448229,1076,8,104,"Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, 1989 [ Seanad ]: Second Stage (Resumed).",14/12/1989,Mr. Noel Treacy,Fianna Fáil,Galway East,"I would like to thank all Deputies who have contributed to the debate. The general reaction of Members on all sides has been to welcome the Bill. Some of the points that have been raised can be more usefully teased out on Committee Stage. However, I will endeavour to reply now to some of the more general points made. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised a number of points. First, he said that the definition of stun gun in the Bill is too narrow, and he gave some example of items, which might be used like a stun gun, and which might not be covered by the present definition. I recognise that there may be validity in that argument. The Minister for Justice will have the matter further examined before Committee Stage. Second, the Deputy, as well as Deputy O'Dea, asked whether imitation firearms could be dealt with in the Bill? The difficulty with this suggestion — and Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned it himself — is that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between an imitation firearm and a toy gun for the purposes of legal definition. Third, Deputy O'Keeffe felt that there should be a definition of 'lawful authority' and 'reasonable excuse' in the Bill. It simply would not be possible to specify all the situations in which these defences could be raised legitimately, and ultimately it must be a matter for the courts to determine on the basis of the particular circumstances of the case whether such a defence has been established. Any attempt to confine these terms in the Bill would cause confusion. [1781] In the circumstances it is best left to the courts. Deputy O'Keeffe questioned whether the search power in section 15 is adequate? I think it is, given that there is a power of arrest and given that searches for knives and other weapons will generally consist of simply frisking people, which is something that can be done on the spot. Deputy Liam Kavanagh asked why crossbows with a draw weight of less than 1. 4 kilogrammes are not being brought within the scope of the Firearms Acts. This point was also raised by Deputy McCartan and other speakers. The answer to these questions is that a crossbow with a draw weight of less than 1. 4 kilogrammes would be a toy, which would not present any danger to the public. I understand that the draw weight of a serious crossbow would range from 20 kilogrammes upward. Deputy McCartan commented that in many cases it would be appropriate that the courts should make community service orders where a person has been convicted under the Bill. I agree with him that such orders could be made in appropriate cases. However, I do not believe it is wise to be seen to water down the penalties, which are provided in the Bill. I think it best that the courts be left to decide whether the circumstances of a case merit the imposition of non-custodial penalty. The Deputy also raised the question of control on martial arts clubs. I have noted his comments on this matter but, as he will appreciate, it is outside the scope of this Bill. I agree with Deputy McCartan when he says the Vagrancy Act, 1824, should be repealed in its entirety. However, this will have to wait until other more urgent legislative priorities have been disposed of. As the Deputy is not doubt aware, the most undesirable provision of that Act, a provision which punished homelessness, was repealed by the Housing Act, 1988. Deputies McCartan, Flanagan and others proposed that longbows should be controlled under the Bill. There have been no reports of serious problems [1782] regarding longbows. They do not share the characteristics which make the crossbow particularly dangerous, that is, they cannot be cocked and kept ready to fire they require skill to use and they are more cumbersome. However, should a problem arise with them the matter can then be considered again. Deputy McCartan and Deputy O'Dea asked why pocket knives are being exempted from the general prohibition on the carrying of knives etc. in places of public entertainment or resort. The reason for this exemption is that a pocket knife is something a person — for example, a pipe smoker — could carry habitually. It is reasonable therefore that it should be exempted from the general prohibition. Deputy McCartan mentioned that he found section 8 unnecessarily confusing. I appreciate his quest for simplicity of expression. Unfortunately, in the context of drafting legislation this is not always possible. I am satisfied that the format of the section is sufficiently clear and is what is needed to deal with the carrying of knives and other dangerous articles. However, we can look at this point in greater detail on Committee Stage. Both Deputies McCartan and Deenihan questioned whether it is appropriate that peace commissioners should be permitted to issue search warrants under the Bill. The position is that in a case which was decided in July 1987 the High Court held that the issuing of search warrants by peace commissioners is not contrary to the Constitution. Deputy McCartan referred to the need to cover 'repair' in section 11. The Deputy will find that this has been done by way of amendment in the Seanad and is covered in the latest text of the Bill. Deputy Deenihan expressed concern that the Bill could create difficulties for cutlery manufacturers. The Deputy can be assured that neither the Bill nor the regulations will adversely affect them. Deputy O'Dea referred to the need to review the question of an appeal procedure where a Garda superintendent refuses a firearms certificate and I have noted this point for future reference. [1783] Deputy O'Dea also referred to the definition of firearm in section 4 (1) (a) and asked for clarification as to whether it might be interpreted to include longbows, catapults etc. Section 4 (1) (a) is merely a repetition of the definition contained in the 1975 Act. The interpretation he suggests has not been taken by our courts down through the years. Deputy O'Dea also mentioned an English case, where a firearm without a firing pin was held to be an imitation firearm. I will certainly look into this case. Deputy O'Dea queried the use of the term 'unlawfully' in section 8 (3). This term is intended to cover members of the security forces — for example, a garda who might carry a baton. Deputy O'Dea also suggested some amendments to section 8 to deal with articles not covered, such as a hammer or an iron bar. I will look at this but I think we may get into difficulties with definitions. Towards the end of this contribution the Deputy also raised questions on the wording used in certain sections, but these are matters we can examine in more detail on Committee Stage. Deputy Flanagan asked about the necessary arrangements to be made for the issue of firearm certificates for stun guns and crossbows. As the only use to which a stun gun can be put is to incapacitate another person, it is not envisaged that any firearm certificates would be issued for these weapons. Crossbows will be permitted for legitimate sporting and recreational use only. Deputy Flanagan suggested that crossbows should not be permitted for hunting. As the Deputy knows the killing of a wild bird or animal with a crossbow is an offence under the Wildlife Acts for which I had some responsibility during the period of the last Government. Deputy Flanagan and Deputy O'Sullivan, among others suggested there should be some controls on Army surplus shops selling dangerous weapons. This will be covered by the regulations to be made under section 12. Deputy Flanagan also queried the position where a person brings a length of pipe or other dangerous article to a [1784] football match or other sporting occasion. This is the type of situation that will be covered by amendments which the Minister for Justice will bring forward on Committee Stage to implement the recommendations of the committee on public safety and crowd control. Deputy Joe Jacob asked what will happen to stun guns already in the country when the Bill is enacted. I want to assure the House that these stun guns will then be treated as firearms and it will be an offence for a person to have one of them in his or her possession or control. Deputy Jacob appealed that something should be done about replica guns. It should be mentioned that our law already provides severe penalties for the use of imitation firearms in the commission of crimes, including up to 14 years imprisonment for possession of an imitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence. This is the way to deal with persons who misuse imitation firearms. Deputy Dermot Fitzpatrick asked that dangerous offensive weapons be prohibited. This will be done under section 11 of the Bill, which gives the Minister for Justice power to make regulations banning such weapons. The Deputy also asked that the Minister should take account of possible future developments in the definition of firearms. I wish to assure my colleagues that this will be examined before Committee Stage. Deputy Fitzpatrick also requested that controls should be introduced on dangerous dogs. I can well understand that a person who represents the Phoenix Park area is interested in this problem. I know that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has an interest in this area and will also share his concern. I share the Deputy's concern in this matter but he will appreciate that it is outside the scope of the Bill which we are presently debating. Deputy Fitzpatrick and others queried the position about aerosol weapons. There is no need to deal separately with spray weapons because any weapon which is designed for the discharge of noxious liquid or gas is already covered by the Firearms Acts. Excellent contributions were also [1785] made by Deputies Durkan, Wallace and Flood. Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan asked whether catapults and other dangerous articles should be controlled or banned altogether. This will be looked at, but the Deputy will appreciate that catapults have legitimate uses. Deputy Flood, in an excellent contribution, asked if pistol crossbows were covered by the Bill. I assure the House that they are most definitely included. I thank all the Deputies who have made positive and sincere contributions to this Second Stage debate. The Minister for Justice looks forward to the Committee Stage debate and I am confident that, with the broad consensus in the House on the Bill, a very worthwhile Act will emerge thereafter. Question put and agreed to.

1184083,415,34,127,"Private Members' Business. - Land Bill, 1963—Committee Stage (Resumed).",04/11/1964,Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan,Monetary Reform,Leix-Offaly,"That is the man to whom we want to give more land and the man we want to help. The only way the Deputy's Party could help him was to force him to emigrate. We want to bring him back, settle him on the land and keep him there by making his life attractive and paying him for what he produces. That is the great difference between Fianna Fáil and this side of the House. Fianna Fáil are quite satisfied to see people flying from the land, to see the smallholders who will be affected by this section, going and endeavouring to set their holdings because they cannot live on them. We want to make life better for them and give them additions to their holdings enabling them to live in decency on the land. That is our policy and that is what we propose to do. The Minister's explanation as to why he is bringing in this section to give him these extraordinary powers is not acceptable to me. I do not believe for one moment that the Minister is introducing this section for the purpose of expediting land division. He is bringing in the section because of his greed for power, because of the greed for power in his Party and because of their desire to hang on by any means, fair, foul or dishonest. They have seen that by depriving a landowner of one of the three F's, fixity of tenure, they may be able to bring him within their power by the fear that if he does not join their ranks he will be dispossessed. Deputy MacEoin told a story here last night about the man who voted in Longford in bygone days. He recorded his vote according to his conscience but, because he did so, he was [377] dispossessed of his property.

3829052,257,9,25,Killing of Paul Quinn: Statements.,07/02/2008,Mr. Seymour Crawford,Fine Gael,Cavan-Monaghan,"I thank my party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, for meeting Briege and Stephen Quinn in Castleblayney and for following through on his commitment to facilitate these statements in Dáil Éireann. I also thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all concerned for agreeing to them. It constitutes an opportunity to put on record Members’ anger and repulsion at the murder of the Quinns’ son and brother, Paul. His murder was premeditated and was carried out in the most cruel way in my constituency in Oram, County Monaghan. I welcome to the Gallery Mr. Stephen Quinn, his son and daughter, Paul’s aunt and other relations. [618]It is not acceptable for any politician or individual to try to justify such a judge, jury and execution system in any country, let alone in respect of the peace process. These statements give all Members a chance to clear the record, which is important for the future. I note the Quinn family seeks a future without any other deaths or retaliation. People from all political backgrounds and none must co-operate with both the Garda and the PSNI so that those responsible can be put behind bars. My constituency colleague, Deputy Margaret Conlon, already stated that more young people are under threat in this region. In recent years, many others have been badly beaten but are afraid even to make statements because they fear for their lives in south County Armagh. Those who murdered Paul Quinn must be brought to justice, otherwise this would be an unacceptable result of all the efforts for peace. Yesterday witnessed the return of the PSNI on to the roads and streets. People have been found buying guns in eastern Europe and districts still lie under fear and are controlled without PSNI involvement. South Armagh is not the only problem area, as two PSNI officers have been shot in other areas. I know from first-hand experience that loyalist districts also are causing serious problems and this issue is not limited to south Armagh or republican areas. Such districts also must be brought under police control. There must and can be only one army and police force in a democratic country. The PSNI, the Garda and the Customs and Excise have had some success in Border areas on other issues in the recent past. The two Governments must provide whatever resources are necessary to bring the murderers of Paul Quinn to justice and give other young people the right to live. Twelve or 14 people could not be involved in such a brutal murder without someone being aware of what happened or who organised it. It is not a secret that the people involved were wearing balaclavas, special uniforms and other items that all had hoped to forget. I plead to their consciences, whoever they are, to break this cycle as they may be the next victims otherwise. While I welcome the statement made today by my constituency colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, I hope that all his colleagues in south Armagh will be as clear. I assure Members that Fine Gael has not raised this issue in the House for political reasons. It brought the issue into the House to provide justice to the Quinn family. Paul Quinn died in the most heinous and tragic circumstances and were his death to go unsolved, it would raise major questions regarding the reason people are unable to speak out. Undoubtedly, many people know exactly who was responsible for this deed. I congratulate all those who attended public meetings in Cullyhanna, Crossmaglen and Castleblayney. My colleague, Deputy Fergus O’Dowd, accompanied me to the meeting in Crossmaglen while others accompanied me to the meeting in Castleblayney. Those meetings provided a clear indication of the high levels of support for the Quinn family, as well as the opportunity for people to speak in public on the problems and to clear Paul Quinn’s name. Young people in south Armagh have as much a right to freedom and opportunity as anyone else on our island home. Let the word go out loud and clear that democracy and justice, based on the rule of law, is the only way forward now and in future. The meetings in Castleblayney and Crossmaglen that I attended were illuminating as for the first time in the history of the Troubles, people were prepared to speak openly and show their support. I appreciate that Deputy Liz McManus travelled all the way from Wicklow to attend that meeting and that my other colleagues from all parties in County Monaghan attended the meeting in Castleblayney. Tremendous openness and a great commitment to law and order was displayed. Such commitment can only be proven to be real if it can be seen that people are prepared to come forward [619]without fear and without the awareness that they face death in order that the Quinn murder can be solved. I have spoken to many people privately since Paul Quinn’s murder. People have come forward and have asked to meet me privately. It has been a revelation to hear of the level of threats and the pressures that exist in that locality. Having worked with all parties in the peace process, I have no doubt that all parties represented in this House are committed to it. However, the only manner in which this can be proved in the long term is to effect the restoration of law and order in all parts of the country and to see real progress in this case. I again sympathise with the Quinn family, their relations and many supporters. I sympathise and pray they will be granted the strength to carry on. Unfortunately, Mrs. Briege Quinn is not present today. She was under great pressure in terms of her health when Deputy Enda Kenny and I met her in Castleblayney and I realise she did not wish to go through the experience of this debate. The manner in which Paul was murdered and his body was abandoned is inexpressible and unbelievable. When Stephen told the details to Deputy Kenny, Briege simply could not take it any longer. I thank her for coming that day to Castleblayney in order that Members witnessed the reality and pressures experienced by the family at first hand. I hope and pray that God will give them the strength to carry on and that they will be seen to receive the justice they deserve through the incarceration of the perpetrators.",07/02/2008,30,736,737,in the history of the Troubles people were prepared to speak openly and show their support I appreciate that Deputy,Liz McManus,travelled all the way from Wicklow to attend that meeting and that my other colleagues from all parties in County,Liz McManus,3829052_11,,in the history of the Troubles people were prepared to speak openly and show their support I appreciate that Deputy Liz McManus travelled all the way from Wicklow to attend that meeting and that my other colleagues from all parties in County,in the history of the Troubles people were prepared to speak openly and show their support I appreciate that Deputy travelled all the way from Wicklow to attend that meeting and that my other colleagues from all parties in County,text17,1,4,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.213453742,0.005336344,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.772772773,0.718718719,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0
1357564,65,8,77,"Committee on Finance. - Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1968: Second Stage (Resumed).",11/12/1968,Mr. Kevin Boland,Fianna Fáil,Dublin County,"If Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde ever reads the Dáil Reports he will see that every Deputy on his side of the House referred to the commission. It is true that the Chair tried to bring the Deputies on the opposite side of the House to order but, in their usual manner, they refused to come to order. However, I do not expect to have time to deal with the arguments with regard to a commission tonight because the Opposition have already made plans to deny me the right of adequate reply. Despite the laboured efforts of the Opposition to make it appear otherwise, it is very obvious from this debate that the volume of genuine dissatisfaction with the proposals in the Bill [2631] is small. The dissatisfaction is not related to any general principle but it is related merely to minor details and the personal prospects of individual Deputies in securing re-election to the Dáil rather than to any fundamental principles of the scheme of the constituencies as proposed. In fact, I relieved the tedium of listening to the same type of allegations being made by one Deputy after another by watching the efforts of the Whips in the Opposition Parties to search out their Deputies from every nook and cranny in the House to persuade them to come in here and make a speech. They were all handed the exact same brief. There was an obvious effort to make it appear that there was in fact some widespread dissatisfaction with the proposals. In so far as it is possible to identify the actual criticism of the Bill from the mass of personal attack in which it was enshrined, I think it emerges quite clearly that the Opposition criticism is directed, not so much at what is being done in the Bill but against the Constitutional provisions that require this to be done. The debate provided, as was to be expected, many examples of the double thinking that has become so natural to Deputies on the opposite side of the House. We have contradictory statements being made in the same sentence. We have had arguments that the new constituencies have been devised with consummate skill so as to benefit Fianna Fáil and to eliminate individual Opposition Deputies. These arguments were combined with boastful claims that the result of the Bill would be to wipe Fianna Fáil off the face of the earth. The volume of real complaint, as distinct from personal abuse, is about equal from both sides of the House and this fact is an indication that the task imposed on the Government, as a result of the Fine Gael action in the courts in 1961 and the decision of the people on 16th October this year, has been approached in as fair and objective a manner as possible. A number of Opposition speakers could not refrain from expressing their own [2632] personal satisfaction with the new constituencies in which they apparently expect to find themselves. My assessment of the position as disclosed by the debate, in so far as it has been allowed to proceed, is that the Opposition are at least as well satisfied with the proposals as are the Fianna Fáil Deputies. I do not say, of course, that they have committed the unpardonable crime of expressing publicly their agreement. I have accused the Opposition of many things but I have never accused them of agreeing publicly with any Fianna Fáil proposal. Of course, I must admit that it is difficult to see how a Bill proposed in the present circumstances could fail to arouse a certain amount of dissatisfaction particularly on the Opposition benches where the instinct of selfpreservation is so strong. After all, the decision which the Opposition was responsible for the people making ensures that at least four Deputies representing rural Ireland who are here at present will not be coming back and the results of by-elections indicate that it is much more likely that these Deputies are at present on the Opposition side of the House rather than on this side. Therefore, irrespective of the actual proposals that are in the Bill, it is inevitable that at least four Deputies from outside Dublin will not be coming back, since the total non-Dublin representation must be reduced by at least this amount under the Bill. That is, of course, unless the planned migration of Fine Gael Deputies from rural areas to Dublin produces results. I have not the full list of the potential migrants but I know that the O'Higgins brethren have been mentioned, Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Lindsay. We on this side of the House have been following breathlessly the exciting accounts of the ebb and flow of the bitter struggle between these wouldbe migrants and the local hopefuls for the four extra Dublin seats that have to be created and for the declared vacant Costello seats. I should like if it is possible to console those Deputies who fear they will become the victims of their own action in reducing rural representation so unjustifiably [2633] by reminding them that they might have lost their seats in any case. Despite the fact that only four of the sixteen general elections we have had in this country have been preceded by a revision of constituencies the average number of Deputies in those sixteen general elections who did not return here for one reason or another after the general election was 33. While I admit that this figure is somewhat distorted by the fact that there were 73 who did not come back in the 1927 election, still, the lowest number that did not return after any general election was 19 in the election of 1944—and that election was held within 12 months of the preceding general election in which there were 27 who did not come back. So, I think it can safely be said, irrespective of the proposals in this Bill, there would in fact be a number of Deputies here who would not be coming back. Therefore, I think it should be possible for those Deputies who feel they are sitting for the last time in Dáil Éireann to console themselves with this knowledge that it is quite on the cards that they would not come back anyway. It is clear from the figures of previous general elections that the pattern of the number of Deputies who did not return has not been affected in any significant way by the previous revisions of constituencies and, mark you, most of them were made by Fianna Fáil. I have no doubt whatever but that there will be no significant difference on this occasion either. Many Deputies have commented on the short time it took to produce this Bill and, in that short time, I am alleged to have pored over maps, over the Census report and over the register of electors and this mysterious detailed information that is supposed to be available to the Fianna Fáil Party with regard to the past, present and future distribution of votes as among the different Parties in different areas. I am alleged to have done this with every Fianna Fáil Deputy, with every county councillor and with every cumann in the country and to have achieved a scheme that won unanimous approval from all these people. [2634] This, I think, would be indeed a remarkable achievement in such a short time and an achievement, I must say, I do not believe it would be possible for anybody to arrive at. Deputy James Tully alleged I went even further—that I was not satisfied to decide on the areas that were to be changed, particularly the areas that were to be changed from one county to another, on the basis of this detailed knowledge as to how the people voted in the past and will vote in the future, but that I also spent long hours, apparently, ensconced with the Registrar of Births and Marriages and Deaths in the Custom House conducting extensive research into his own genealogy and, by implication, into the genealogy of other Opposition Deputies and that, having discovered the areas from which his forebears originated, I selected that area of County Meath for detachment to the constituency of County Monaghan—apparently on the assumption that all his relatives who were extant in that area from which he had migrated would, if they were left in Meath, support their illustrious kinsman, Deputy James Tully. I think it was a remarkable coincidence that, having made this alleged research, I discovered that this area happened to be the area of County Meath that was contiguous to County Monaghan. More remarkable, later on I was accused of having selected this very same area in order to injure Deputy Farrelly. I was accused of that by Deputy Clinton who is, I appreciate, better acquainted with County Meath than with County Dublin. Therefore, I was fortunate that this area affected both the Opposition Deputies. I did not, in fact, conduct any research into Deputy James Tully's genealogy but I did have some discussions about this remarkable allegation. What did I discover? I discovered that this area was also the ancestral area of the present Minister for Defence. So, here we find that this area apparently—it is a small area—affects the three of them. That is indicative of the type of nonsensical allegation that has been made. As I have said, a number of Opposition Deputies during this debate upbraided me for being too precipitate [2635] in bringing in this Bill for acting, as they alleged, unnecessarily and entirely on my own initiative, to change a satisfactory arrangement of constituencies for the sole benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party, However, in the usual contradictory manner of the Opposition, others have alleged I was anything but enthusiastic in bringing in the Bill. For my own part, I accept the latter allegation. I frankly admit that I regarded the task of revising the constituencies and bringing in this Bill as a distasteful and undesirable one. It has been done by me only under duress. I can show that it was done under duress because from the very moment the 1966 Census of Population was published I was subjected to pressure, through Parliamentary Questions and supplementary questions from many Deputies on the Opposition side of the House. On 19th October, 1966, as reported in volume 230, No. 8 of the Official Report, Deputy Seán Dunne, my own colleague, asked the Minister for Local Government if it was proposed to revise the Dáil constituencies before the next election in view of the population changes since the last distribution of seats. He pressed me at some quite considerable length with supplementaries on this matter and was assisted by Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. Subsequently, on 13th July, 1967, Deputy Michael O'Leary asked a similar question and, again, on 6th April, 1967 Deputy Sweetman asked a similar question. On that occasion, I was pressed to carry out this revision of constituencies by Deputy L'Estrange, by Deputy Cosgrave, by Deputy Seán Dunne, by Deputy Clinton, by Deputy Reynolds and by Deputy Donnellan. Again, I was asked a similar question earlier by my colleague, Deputy Seán Dunne. It was as a result of this pressure by Opposition Deputies that we decided we would either have to carry out the revision of constituencies demanded by the Opposition or else give the people the opportunity, which the Opposition also demanded in 1961, of removing what Deputy Costello described as 'this Constitutional infirmity'. [2636] I have described the Constitutional position. I did that in my opening statement and no one has seriously suggested that revision was not inevitable. The Government did everything possible to avoid bringing in this Bill. It was because of the pressure to revise the constituencies that we decided to ask the people to amend the Constitution and that decision was in clear response to the demands of the Opposition in 1961. I quoted these demands before and I propose to quote from only one member of the Opposition now and I do so because of a particular speech made on this particular Bill. I quote from the late Deputy Michael Donnellan, volume 188 of the Official Report of 12th April, 1961. Deputy Donnellan said: The Taoiseach was not man enough to submit the matter to a referendum so that the people might be given an opportunity of changing the relevant Article in the Constitution and getting a fair crack of the whip. Later he said: I regret the Taoiseach did not put this by way of referendum to the people. This was typical of the attitude at that time and, as I said, it was in response to that that we tried to avoid having to bring in a Bill on this basis at this particular time. But, just as the interpretation of the Constitution, with which we must now conform, was established by a Fine Gael manoeuvre in the courts so the rejection by the people of the amendment of the Constitution, which would have made this Bill unnecessary and which they demanded, as I said, in 1961, was also engineered by the two Opposition Parties. It is they who are responsible for this Bill, not I. I am bringing it in only because it was forced upon me by the Coalition and I am— I agree with Deputy Dockrell—completely unenthusiastic about it. I will go further and say I do not know anyone in the Fianna Fáil Party, from the Taoiseach down, who is enthusiastic about it and who does not regard it as undesirable. But the Constitution must be obeyed and this revision of constituencies has to be made because the Opposition have insisted on it. [2637] What is being done in this Bill has to be done, or something very like it, to comply with the law. Admittedly, there is an infinite, or practically infinite, number of ways in which the rearrangement could be carried out. I said that in my opening statement. I also said that I think this is the least objectionable way. That is the most I can say about it. I do not need any Opposition Deputy to point out that I do not like the idea of depriving the rural areas of representation to which they are fully entitled, even on the basis of the most rigid interpretation of any theoretical principle. I do not like having to squeeze an unjustified four seats into Dublin. I do not like having to bring in a Bill which must ensure that at least four of the sitting Deputies in this House will not be coming back after the next general election. I do not like having to take parts of one county and transfer them into another county. Putting it mildly, I am not enthusiastic about pushing people around from county to county and constituency to constituency every five years or, as Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins said, playing musical chairs with the people. I am not enthusiastic about this. I do not want to do it. I am doing it only because I have to. I am not enthusiastic about requiring Deputies and their political organisations to readjust themselves to new constituencies so frequently, as is likely to be the case from now on, and I am not enthusiastic about the distortion of votes as between the rural areas in general and the Dublin area, a distortion which is inherent in the present position. But that is the law as laid down in the Constitution and as copperfastened by the decision made in the recent referendum. If we leave out detailed references to specific areas each Opposition speech was, I think, entirely predictable. Certainly, I did not need to come in here and listen to the debate to know what would be said. Knowing, as I did, what has been the motivating force of the Opposition down through the years, I take it as the highest possible personal compliment that their hatred has now apparently become concentrated on me. In fact, the more vicious and hysterical their personal abuse becomes [2638] the surer I am that I am on the right lines. All the things that have been said in this debate were of course said before the Bill was published at all. The allegations were obviously drafted in advance. The Parties opposite—it is, I suppose, still appropriate to refer to them in the plural, although I do not see any very noticeable difference in approach between them—made these allegations of gerrymandering before ever there was any inkling at all of what was in the Bill. This was a safe thing to do because information indicating the inevitability of a great deal of chopping and changing of constituencies and the inevitability of parts of one county being attached to another county was available. It was known before the Bill was published that there were 24 of the 38 constituencies in breach of the Constitution. It was known they must be changed and it was known that the changes would inevitably involve the majority of the other constituencies. This was well known to the Opposition because this position was connived at by themselves. It was well known that it was not permissible to exercise any but the very minimal amount of divergence in, for instance, adhering to county boundaries. It was known even before the Bill was drafted that it was necessary for the rural part of the country to lose at least four seats and that these four seats must be squeezed into Dublin and this would involve a fundamental redrafting of constituencies. This disruption being, as it was, inevitable it was obvious that the Opposition could plausibly allege gerrymandering without having in any way to justify the allegation because they know these things were the inescapable result of the decision made on 16th October at the behest of the Opposition Parties. They have chosen to interpret the decisive rejection by the people of our advice to change the electoral system as a political victory for themselves. They will, I think, soon enough discover how mistaken they are but, taking into account their long experience of failure in elections, it is not surprising that the result of the referendum should have gone to their heads. [2639] They could not even contain themselves to wait to make these allegations until the Bill was published because, as I said, they knew the type of thing that would have to be done as a result of their monoeuvring in the courts in 1961 and the decision made on the referendum earlier this year. But even in this they cannot be logical or consistent. I think almost every Opposition Deputy dutifully repeated this allegation of gerrymandering, and highly skilful gerrymandering at that. They practically all alleged that the end result would be a decisive change of Government. This is certainly a new definition of skilful gerrymandering—a scheme of constituencies that will result in a decisive defeat for the Government which makes the revision. I would be inclined to describe that as anything but skilful gerrymandering. Shorn of the volume of personal abuse in which they were couched, the Opposition speeches boil down to saying that the Minister did not gerrymander, this was only because he could not do it, and he would have done it if he could. I am satisfied that if a count were made of the Deputies on both sides of the House who are reasonably satisfied, and those who are genuinely worried for their own personal survival, the result would be about equal. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Dunne, that, in fact, it is not possible to gerrymander, that the knowledge on which to base gerrymandering is not available. As reported in the Official Report of the debate on 27th November he said he did not see how it is possible today for any Party to say with certainty where their support will lie. That is the position so far as I am concerned. I thoroughly agree. Even if I had wanted to gerrymander I would not have had the information available to me. However, so far from my wanting to do any of those things I agree with those Opposition Deputies who said that I was not enthusiastic about it. I did not want to bring in this Bill at all. It was forced upon me and the Government. In order to put the issues, if issues they are, between us in perspective it is necessary to distinguish the matters [2640] on which there is a basic agreement apparently, in so far as it can be gathered from the debate, from those matters which appear to be somewhat in dispute. I think there are more of the former than of the latter. The first point on which there is general agreement is the necessity for having a revision before the next general election, having regard to the population figures disclosed in the 1966 census. In fact, it is obvious that this became apparent to the Opposition before it dawned on the Government side. That is obvious from the Questions put down almost as soon as the census report was covered. In fact, it appears that Deputies were waiting for the report of the census in order to demand just exactly what has to be done now. The second point which appears to be generally accepted is that the total number of Deputies should remain at 144. There was not any complaint about that. The third point on which there was general agreement—I do not say complete agreement—was that in revising the constituencies the maximum divergence from the national average of population per Deputy should be 1,000 above or below the national average. I appreciate that Deputy Fitzpatrick sought to imply that we could avail of a much greater divergence than this, even after all our arguments during the referendum campaign, and in the debate on the Bills, but in view of the fact that the referendum was contested on the basis that that was the maximum permissible divergence, and that in the referendum the people decided to maintain the status quo, I find it hard to believe that this was seriously intended. I appreciate that some other Deputies, notably Deputy Dunne, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, felt that no divergence at all was permissible, and are of the opinion that even taking four seats from the rural parts of the country and putting them into the Dublin area is still doing a savage injustice to the people of Dublin. That view, I admit, was expressed very forcibly on behalf of the Labour Party by my colleague Deputy Dunne who alleged that we should have taken more seats from the rural areas and put them in [2641] Dublin. He did not specify how many. Apparently the Labour Party did not go into the question in the same detail as did the Fine Gael Party, so it is an unspecified number of extra seats apparently which should have been put in with Dublin. Generally speaking, however, I think it was agreed that this divergence of 1,000 up or down was acceptable. Another point on which there appeared to be general agreement, not complete agreement, was on the regional distribution of the seats. It seems to be agreed that the maximum permissible under present conditions 30 seats should be allocated the western area consisting of County Donegal, the Province of Connacht and County Clare, 38 seats in Dublin, and 76 in the rest of Ireland. As Deputy Donegan said, an eminent economist and statistician in the Seanad and an eminent surgeon in this House put forward their own scheme for this on the same basis as the scheme brought in. Both of them gave the same regional distribution of 30 in the west, 38 in Dublin, and 76 in the rest of Ireland. Here again, of course, Deputy Dunne is the odd man out. He maintains that this allocation of seats was a vindictive attack on the fundamental rights of the people of Dublin, thus apparently placing his two eminent Coalition colleagues in the same category as the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government. There is a wide measure of agreement in regard to the general size of constituencies, that is that the constituencies should return either three, four or five Deputies. I do not claim there was agreement as to the relative number of constituencies of each different size there should be. Apart from one or two Deputies, there was no real advocacy of larger constituencies or constituencies returning a greater number of Deputies. Finally, although there were some Deputies who continued to bury their heads in the sand, there was general acceptance of the fact that the Constitution requires the breaching of county boundaries in many cases. In this respect, as was to be expected, the point of disagreement relates primarily to the precise breaching which must be [2642] made and here, naturally, there are almost as many opinions as there are Deputies in the House. Apart from individual complaints about their constituencies there were only two points of general disagreement that I could find in the debate. The first was the relative number of three, four and five constituencies we should have, where the different sized constituencies should be located, and the degree to which the breaching of county boundaries was necessary. I propose to deal with these points. With regard to the matter of breaching the county boundaries I have said that this is inevitable. What I really intended to convey was that it was inevitable that, if we continue to operate the electoral system as it was in the past—if we go in to a greater extent for the grouping together of counties and if we get constituencies returning a larger number of Deputies, it would be possible to keep every county intact, although many counties would be united with other counties. For instance, a possible arrangement which would avoid the dismemberment of counties but would involve much more multi-county constituencies would be this. The three counties of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim could justify under the present provisions an allocation of ten Deputies without any breaching. The two Counties of Mayo and Roscommon could be joined into a constituency returning nine Deputies. Clare and Galway would be somewhat over the national average but could be joined to come within the interpretation of the Constitution in a constituency returning 11 Deputies. Limerick and Kerry could be joined together in a constituency of 13 Deputies. Tipperary and Waterford could be joined in a constituency of ten Deputies. Cork County could return 11 Deputies as a single constituency. Cavan, Longford and Westmeath could be joined together to return seven Deputies. Louth, Meath and Monaghan could return nine. Kildare, Laois and Offaly could return eight. Carlow, Kilkenny, Wicklow and Wexford could return 12 and Cork City could return six. Dublin County could return 11 and then that would leave 27 for Dublin [2643] City which could conceivably be one constituency or three nine-seat constituencies. I appreciate that constituencies returning a number of Deputies of this order would be nearer to the situation that was envisaged by the inventors of the system and I admit that, in view of the decisive nature of the referendum result, I was drawn to this type of solution. But I do not think that this type of scheme of constituencies was really an issue in the referendum. I think the decision was in fact in favour of constituencies returning a small number of Deputies as now. There would, I think, be many practical disadvantages in such a scheme of constituencies. For instance, I am sure Deputies will have noticed that if we had Limerick and Kerry joined together in one constituency, as would be necessary to avoid breaching of boundaries in that area, we would have had already in the lifetime of this Dáil, three by-elections in that constituency although the Dáil has still something over a year to run its full course. I imagine that most Deputies will agree that the people would be likely to become somewhat irritated by this almost continuous election activity. I need hardly say that the last thing I would like to do would be to cause any disillusionment with such an excellent system. In this type of arrangement which approaches the ideal of proportional representation Deputies might, for instance, be interested to speculate on the prospects of a deceased Deputy in Roscommon being replaced by a Roscommon candidate in a by-election in a constituency where the Mayo electors would outnumber the Roscommon ones by two to one and similarly in regard to the joining together of Clare and Galway and other areas. I do not think there can be any doubt about my attitude to this question of the breaching of county boundaries or the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party. Although it is no doubt true, as Senator Dooge informed me in the Seanad, that these divisions were instituted by the illustrious King John at the turn of the twelfth century, we [2644] on this side of the House abhor the necessity to breach county boundaries in this way. Deputy Barrett asked me why I have changed my attitude to this matter. My only reply is that I have not changed my attitude at all but the people decided against me and I am compelled to do what I endeavoured to avoid. Apparently there is not complete agreement in regard to the size of the constituencies but I may say that the Government decided at the outset against the creation of any new, large, unwieldy five-seat constituencies especially in rural areas. We decided, for instance, against the creation of a large, difficult to work constituency comprising practically the whole of County Donegal and similarly with regard to Kerry. The decision not to do this involved in the one case additions to Donegal from Leitrim and in the other case additions to Kerry from Cork in order to retain two three-seat constituencies in these areas. We decided also against the formation of what we looked upon as the suggested monstrosity of a joint Cavan-Monaghan constituency, which would be a long straggling one extending almost in the shape of a 'U' around the Border of the Six County area. I think it is only necessary to look at a map to see the impracticality of this suggestion and the difficulty that would be involved both for the people and for their Deputies. We considered an arrangement that would involve a suggestion that has been made here of a Kildare-Carlow constituency, but again the creation of such a long straggling anomalous type of constituency did not appeal to us. This, in fact, involved the disruption of the whole population of Carlow which has been in a constituency with Kilkenny for quite a number of years and it seemed to us at any rate to be a less acceptable solution than the solution that was decided upon. While I am on this question I must refer to one aspect of the Opposition's contribution that I must admit puzzles me and that is the apparent unanimity in the Fine Gael Party that Donegal should have been made a five-seat constituency by the detachment of the Bundoran and Ballyshannon areas [2645] from it and their transfer into County Leitrim. I do not know why there is this apparent concentration on Deputy O'Donnell's seat, why Fine Gael seem to be so anxious to take away a considerable portion of that particular constituency and convert the Donegal situation into a single five-seat constituency in which Deputy O'Donnell obviously would not secure his seat. Of course, it may be that he has been successful in this planned migration of Fine Gael rural Deputies to the Dublin area. I know, because I was present, that he did during the referendum campaign advocate the type of solution that we have in fact adopted—the creation of an increased number of three-seat constituencies—on the basis that this would be a scheme of constituencies that would make it more likely that the people would be able to return a Government at election time. I do know that his Party officially favours the creation of a situation in which it will not be possible for the people to do this, that they have this coalition mentality and that what they aim at is a situation in which there will be continuously indecisive results but I do not know that this was sufficient to justify this attack on his seat. I admit he does not appear here as often as his colleague, Deputy Harte, but then when he does come he behaves himself and does not get himself ejected with such monotonous regularity. In regard to this question of the number of three-seat constituencies——",11/12/1968,18,1406,1408,extant in that area from which he had migrated would if they were left in Meath support their illustrious kinsman,Deputy James Tully,I think it was a remarkable coincidence that having made this alleged research I discovered that this area happened to,Deputy James Tully,1357564_13,,extant in that area from which he had migrated would if they were left in Meath support their illustrious kinsman Deputy James Tully I think it was a remarkable coincidence that having made this alleged research I discovered that this area happened to,extant in that area from which he had migrated would if they were left in Meath support their illustrious kinsman I think it was a remarkable coincidence that having made this alleged research I discovered that this area happened to,text843,1,4,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.276699295,0.006917482,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.852852853,0.796796797,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0
2525538,986,26,93,"Sugar Bill, 1990: Committee Stage.",06/03/1991,Mr. Pat Rabbitte,The Workers' Party,Dublin South-West,"I stand corrected, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I shall do that, but allow me to conclude. The example we seem to be following is that of our neighbouring island. I would like to refer briefly to an assessment of that in The Irish Times of 18 April 1990. A financial commentator in a major article on privatisation in the British experience make the following point: The winner from privatisation in the UK where those who bought the shares well below market prices the management of the newly privatised companies, financial institutions, professional advisers and the Government. The losers are less visible, being the general taxpayers, and workers in the companies. That commentator gave examples of 12 State companies in drawing that conclusion. He said: An examination of the UK privatisation programme shows that there were far greater efficiency gains in public enterprises prior to privatisation than since, and the remaining public enterprises outperformed private industry as a whole on a number of criteria. The transformation of public sector monopolies into private ones has not led to the expected improvements in services, but to higher profits at the expense of the consumer. We have seen that, for example, in British Telecom to which Deputy Kavanagh referred. The consumer is getting a worse deal, a more expensive deal. I cannot see an argument on economic grounds. If the Minister has such an argument I would plead with him to at least put it on the record of the House because that is the only argument that makes sense. If the Minister has an argument on economic grounds that justifies defeating Deputy Kavanagh's amendment, that is [61] allowing control of the Sugar Company to pass out of Irish hands, it should be put on the record of the House.",06/03/1991,26,203,204,to higher profits at the expense of the consumer We have seen that for example in British Telecom to which,Deputy Kavanagh,referred The consumer is getting a worse deal a more expensive deal I cannot see an argument on economic grounds,Deputy Kavanagh,2525538_1,,to higher profits at the expense of the consumer We have seen that for example in British Telecom to which Deputy Kavanagh referred The consumer is getting a worse deal a more expensive deal I cannot see an argument on economic grounds,to higher profits at the expense of the consumer We have seen that for example in British Telecom to which referred The consumer is getting a worse deal a more expensive deal I cannot see an argument on economic grounds,text573,2,0,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-1.609437912,-0.040235948,0.039528471,0.000988212,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.024024024,0.067067067,0.476476476,0.469469469,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
3006964,253,8,123,Private Members' Business. - Facilities for the Disabled: Motion.,01/12/1998,Mr. Brian Cowen,Fianna Fáil,Laoighis-Offaly,"I listened in silence for 40 minutes to contributions from the opposite side of the House. I am as concerned as Deputy Owen about these issues which I want to deal with properly. If interest payments of £40 million a week could be reduced, there would be more money available to deal with them. The Opposition made no attempt to defend its record in government or compare it with that of the Government over the past 18 months. It does people with disabilities a disservice in suggesting there is a golden opportunity to address these issues. It is a facile argument. The objective is not professional accountancy, as the Green Party suggests, but to ensure the Minister for Health and Children will have much more money at his or her disposal to provide the required services. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on issues related to the provision of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and to outline the Government's plan to meet the needs of this group. The Government fully supports the principle that people with disabilities are entitled to all the rights and privileges which [1018] go with citizenship and that any and every barrier to the enjoyment of these rights and privileges should be removed. These barriers have been identified by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in its report, A Strategy for Equality. In drawing up its recommendations the commission adopted three guiding principles — equality, maximising participation and enabling independence and choice. The overall thrust of health policy for people with disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable each individual to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence. Ensuring equality, participation and independence for people with disabilities involves much more than health services appropriate to their needs. People with disabilities are tired of what they call 'the health model of disability'. They wish to be treated the same as their fellow citizens by having services delivered to them by the mainstream agencies, that is, the agency that provides the service for the rest of the community. This is one of the objectives set out by the commission in its report. The pursuit of this objective is a fundamental element of the Government's policy on people with disabilities. As it involves a wide range of services crossing numerous boundaries of Government Departments, the Government decided on day one to appoint one person to co-ordinate efforts to achieve this objective. That person is the Minister for State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, who has responsibility for all matters related to disability. The appointment of a Minister of State with special responsibility for disability issues is a clear indication of the Government's determination to tackle not just health issues but all issues affecting people with disabilities. A specific commitment is given in the programme for Government to the implementation of the commission's report. The practical steps needed to develop services within my area of responsibility are outlined in the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future. A commitment to implement the recommendations of this report is given in Partnership 2000 which states that 'resources will be allocated, within overall expenditure parameters, for the development of services for people with disabilities in line with the Report of the Review Group'. A commitment was also given in the Department's strategy statement, 1998-2001, which undertakes to pursue the development of services for people with disabilities in line with the report's recommendations. There are no definitive statistics for the number of people with physical and sensory disabilities. Based on population trends in other countries it has been variously estimated that the number here could be anywhere between 100,000 and 200,000. Not every person with a physical or sensory disability is in need of a health service. The [1019] report, Towards an Independent Future, highlighted the lack of reliable information on the numbers and service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities and recommended the establishment by the Department, health boards and voluntary bodies of a database on the health service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities. As a first step the review group recommended the establishment by the Department of a database development committee to prepare detailed proposals for the development of the database. Nominations for membership have now been made and the committee will begin its work next month. A joint database pilot project has been undertaken in three health boards and this will provide a valuable impetus to the work of the committee. Once established the database will provide reliable and up-to-date information for a number of separate but related purposes. It will provide epidemiological information at national level to describe the prevalence and, where possible, annual incidence of the various types of disability and to provide a baseline from which trends can be monitored over time provide the factual information necessary for the orderly planning of service developments at national, regional and sub-regional level, including prioritising service needs and assisting in decisions on the allocation of resources enable individual health boards and other service providers to maintain, at their discretion, data for their own purposes such as the development of group or individual care plans and it will provide a valuable resource for the purposes of research. One of the basic recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is the establishment of a national disability authority. Progress is continuing on the implementation of the report of the establishment group on the new national disability authority. As the House is aware, the establishment group is currently analysing and discussing the practical implementation of the report, Building a Future Together, which was approved by the Government earlier this year. All relevant Government Departments and agencies are fully engaged in this process. The final stages in the preparation of the national disability authority Bill have been reached. I give credit to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, for her contribution to achieving this progress. Her determination to see matters through has meant that the impetus for change will not be lost. Credit is also due to the staff of the NRB. Without their valuable input and co-operation over the past three decades or so, we would not have reached the stage we are at now — improving, advancing and reshaping the State's apparatus for the delivery of services for people with disabilities. I fully recognise the importance of their contribution. I take this opportunity to thank all the staff at the NRB. The imminent dissolution of the [1020] NRB signals not the end of its influence but a milestone in the beginning of a whole new emphasis for the delivery of services for people with disabilities. The proposed reconfiguration of institutional responsibilities for these services will ensure a more targeted and inclusive approach. The planned changes should be effected early next year. The knock-on effect of the transfer and the mainstreaming of vocational training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will free up my Department to concentrate fully on its primary role which is to provide rehabilitative training and care services, and appropriate work opportunities for people with disabilities. The aim will be to equip and enable them where possible to advance through the training continuum to other mainstream activities. Currently some £18 million is provided through the Operational Programme for Human Resources, from the European Social Fund, on an annual basis towards the cost of vocational training for people with disabilities. This funding supports vocational training services and the very important work of many service providers. A sum of £33 million pounds has been provided through the same operational programme from the European Regional Development fund over the five year period 1994-95. This funding has been made available towards the purchase of new centres, the upgrading of existing centres and for equipment. One of the difficulties in developing services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is the very wide range and variety of disabilities included in that category. This makes the development of the services rather complex. From time to time a certain group will mount a campaign for the development of a particular service. Respite care and personal assistance services are examples. While these and other services are of vital importance and are among the priority areas for development, they cannot be treated in isolation. What is involved is a wide range of interlocking and complementary services, designed to provide the person with a disability with a flexible range of services. Many individuals with disabilities may require a combination of several services to meet their needs. To clarify the complex issues involved and to provide a blueprint for the development of the services my predecessor, Dr. John O'Connell established on 30 June 1992 the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities. The terms of reference of the group were : To examine the current provision of health care services to people with physical and sensory disabilities and to consider how they should be developed to meet more effectively their needs and specifically to make recommendations for service developments in accordance with the commitment contained in [1021] Section IV, Paragraph 33 of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. The Minister requested the group to prepare an interim report on the most urgent service needs so that these could be considered in the context of developments under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress in 1993. The interim report was submitted to the Minister in December 1992. On foot of the interim report, additional revenue funding of £1. 5 million was made available in 1993 for the development of the services and a pattern established whereby additional development funding is provided every year. The final report of the review group, Towards an Independent Future, was published in December 1996. It set out the requirements for the development of the services over a five year period. I am committed to the implementation of the report. We are very fortunate to have a culture of concern for the welfare of our fellow citizens. This is manifested by the considerable number of people who work tirelessly both in a voluntary capacity and on a professional basis with voluntary agencies in providing a wide range of supports and services to their fellow citizens. The effect of this is most evident in the health sector where many voluntary agencies provide services which have, over time, become a vital part of our overall scheme of health care delivery. This was fully recognised by the review group in looking at the organisation of services. The group recommended the structured involvement of the voluntary agencies in planning and co-ordinating the services and in fixing priorities for the allocation of funding for the development of the services. The review group's recommendation was that the chief executive officer of each health board should establish a regional co-ordinating committee for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Membership of the committee would comprise officers of the health board, major voluntary sector services providers, representatives of service users, that is, people with disabilities and the National Rehabilitation Board. These committees have now been established in every health board. My Department is currently pursuing a review of the operation of the committees in consultation with the health boards and the voluntary organisations concerned. The purpose of the review is to identify best practice, to encourage a cross-fertilisation of ideas across the regions, to come up with solutions to any teething problems which may have arisen and to contribute to the development of overall national policy. Voluntary service cannot be mentioned without referring to the invaluable contribution made by carers. It is estimated that there are about 100,000 carers in lreland, 25,000 of whom provide care on a full-time basis. Although the majority of these care for an elderly person, a sizeable proportion provide care for people with disabilities. [1022] People with disabilities living at home require assistance with the tasks of daily living and often the responsibility for the care rests with one person principally. The review group report acknowledges the need to expand and develop different levels of home support services for people with disabilities and their carers. The crucial role of the carer is taken into account in the planning of services with, for instance, the strong emphasis placed on the development of respite care services, which benefit both the person with a disability and the carer. The provision of this and other support services with the object of enabling the person with a disability to remain in the home serve the dual purpose of promoting independent living for the person with a disability and of taking as much pressure as possible off the carer. There has been a long running campaign by the Centre for Independent Living for a personal assistance service funded by an independent living fund. A personal assistant provides assistance at the discretion and direction of a person with a disability with everyday tasks, such as personal care, household tasks etc., which the person is unable to do for him or herself. A full PA service is defined by the Centre for Independent Living as a need for at least 20 hours service per week. One person can require up to 105 hours, necessitating the employment of three PA's and can cost in excess of £20,000 per annum. The independent living fund is no more than a model for funding a PA service. The important thing is that the service itself be provided to those needing it — the precise manner of funding it is a detail. The PA service is one of a range of support services designed to enable people with disabilities to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence. The range includes home helps, home care attendants, respite care, day care etc. and the objective of policy is to develop the range of services as a whole. The amount of funding to be devoted to the development of this service will be decided in each health board area in accordance with locally perceived priorities. Out of £3 million provided for development of services in 1998, £113,000 was allocated by the boards to personal assistance services. On the question of funding, the review group report set out the requirements for the development of the services over a five year period. It specified numbers of additional places in services such as long-term residential and respite care and day care and numbers of additional staff, such as therapists and nurses. The review group estimated the cost of implementing its recommendations at £50 million over the five year period. A major proportion of the services for people with disabilities are provided by agencies in the voluntary sector. Very often the provision of services was in response to demands for services from their own members. Some of these could be funded out of fundraising income but not all. A situation developed over a period of years where services were not fully funded by the State. In [1023] recent years with falling income from fundraising most agencies have been running services at a loss and thereby building up debts. One of the basic recommendations of the review group is that existing services be put on a firm financial footing to provide a sound basis for future development. In 1998, £2. 4 million has been provided in my Department's Estimates towards the elimination of this underfunding by the State. In addition, in 1997, a Supplementary Estimate of £5 million was provided to eliminate the accumulated deficits of these agencies. One of the areas singled out by people with disabilities and their advocates is aids and appliances for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Shortly after taking office this Government took an early opportunity to alleviate this problem when, on 27 October 1997, decided, with the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, to make £4. 325 million available out of savings on his Department's Vote for aids, appliances and equipment for people with physical and sensory disabilities. It is estimated that more than 10,000 people with disabilities benefited. A further £1 million in capital funding was made available to health boards in 1998 for aids and appliances. Notwithstanding this funding, it was brought to my attention recently that there are still substantial waiting lists in health boards for aids and appliances and, as I announced earlier, I have decided to allocate a further £4 million to help eliminate these waiting lists. This will be distributed on a regional basis through health boards to specific organisations. The Irish Wheelchair Association will receive £1. 5 million Cerebral Palsy Ireland will receive £500,000 the Rehab group will receive £500,000 the Central Remedial Clinic will receive £500,000 the National Rehabilitation Hospital will receive £100,000 £500,000 will be allocated for sensory disabilities and £400,000 will be allocated for other organisations. I expect the agencies will work closely with the health boards to ensure primacy is given to those already identified as waiting for aids and appliances. It is important that there continues to be a high level of co-operation between statutory and voluntary bodies to ensure services are provided in an orderly and planned way. This year a total of £8. 4 million was allocated to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £2. 4 million was devoted to eliminating core underfunding of existing services and nine of the main voluntary agencies in the sector received grants for this purpose. A further £3 million was for capital projects, £1 million of which was invested in aids and appliances. The balance of £3 million was allocated to health boards for further development of the services. Almost half of this funding was used to create 50 new posts in health boards such as speech and language therapists, [1024] physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers and public health nurses. In terms of new structures put in place to facilitate the co-ordination of existing services and to make the development of services more effective and the allocation of substantial additional funding, this Government's commitment to improving the quality of life of people with physical and sensory disabilities is clearly demonstrated. Following the publication of the report, Towards an Independent Future, in December 1996, the previous Government provided a total of £3. 688 million in 1997. Since taking office my Government has to date provided a total of £22. 4 million for these services. No matter how you parse and analyse those figures, the performance of the present Government in pursuing the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities cannot be faulted in comparison with the previous Administration.",01/12/1998,28,1018,1020,preparation of the national disability authority Bill have been reached I give credit to my colleague the Minister of State,Deputy Mary Wallace,for her contribution to achieving this progress Her determination to see matters through has meant that the impetus for change,Deputy Mary Wallace,3006964_7,,preparation of the national disability authority Bill have been reached I give credit to my colleague the Minister of State Deputy Mary Wallace for her contribution to achieving this progress Her determination to see matters through has meant that the impetus for change,preparation of the national disability authority Bill have been reached I give credit to my colleague the Minister of State for her contribution to achieving this progress Her determination to see matters through has meant that the impetus for change,text782,1,6,0,0,40,0.125,5,1.466337069,0.036658427,0.339944848,0.008498621,0.970970971,0.98998999,0.84984985,0.804804805,0.898898899,0.845845846,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0

3371710,535,14,181,Private Members' Business. - Mental Health: Motion.,10/06/2003,Mr. Brendan Howlin,The Labour Party,Wexford,"I propose to share my time with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this interesting debate. When I volunteered to speak I did not expect a full press gallery as this is not an issue that attracts attention. Other issues in the health portfolio would ensure a full Gallery, a full press gallery and much more focus. However, there are few issues that are as important as this or that will impact on as many of our citizens and families. I congratulate Fine Gael, in particular Deputy Neville, for his personal interest in this issue which has been neglected in the health portfolio for a long time. There has been much focus during the last number of months on health issues which, as the Minister knows, are seldom out of the news. Mental health seldom gets the spotlight or interest, a fact acknowledged by both the Minister and the Minister of State. Some would say that mental health is the Cinderella of the service. I know, from my own time in Hawkins House, that the Minister and Minister of State will have heard that point made by umpteen groups and deputations. Society needs to take cognisance of this. The Fine Gael motion makes reference to a number of recent reports which I have had the opportunity to look through. The only conclusion one can come to on reading those reports is that we are all shamed by the status of mental health services in this first world, developed, wealthy country. I say this as a former office holder in the Department of Health. Deputy Tim O'Malley is a new Minister of State, only 12 months in this House. In honesty I must say to him that it is disappointing that the response to this well thought out important motion is standard. I know he did not draft it. These responses are brought up on the system and are brought to Cabinet and rubber stamped on the day.

3425202,630,8,93,Civil Registration Bill 2003: Second Stage (Resumed).,28/01/2004,Mr. Conor Lenihan,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South-West,"I commend the Bill to the House and am glad to see that Deputy Seán Ryan is supporting it. I commend him for his public acknowledgement in the House of the changing nature of Irish society and of its multiethnic character, which we both see in our constituencies. Furthermore, I commend him for recognising the need to respect ethnic and religious diversity. It is important that Members acknowledge this, especially because there is in [899]Ireland a worrying trend of racism against ethnic minorities who come to our shores to work and make a living. It is important that we acknowledge that no party in the House has chosen to abuse this particular issue in a niggardly and awful way through racism or sought to build votes around a racist platform. This Bill represents a milestone. The last time we had legislation of this kind was in 1845, a time in our history that presaged the famine and mass emigration. The famine was a tragic event in our history, and the population went into decline thereafter. It was also a period of failure in economic and social terms. In recent decades we have gladly seen a complete resurgence in our fortunes to the extent that we are now introducing a Bill that consolidates previous legislation, brings new technologies to bear on the essential and eternal issues of birth, marriage and death and mirrors the social complexity about which Deputy Seán Ryan spoke. The Bill also contains an idea that perhaps would never have been envisaged in 1844 or 1845, namely, that of formalising the approach to adoption, nullity and divorce. These are the modern eternals that accompany the other eternal human milestones that define our lives and society. It is important that we acknowledge that our population is again climbing and that it may not be long until we achieve the population we had attained prior to the famine. This is a great indicator of success and a great tribute to the many political parties in the House that have led this new State since independence. This Bill is, in a way, an expression of our sovereignty as a country, state and nation. We are again asserting our sovereignty in the all-essential areas of birth, marriage and death. It may not be a controversial Bill — there is all-party agreement on it — but it marks a very significant milestone in our social development. It is instructive to note that the United State enjoys pre-eminence in the increasingly global economy that now obtains, to the extent that it is responsible for 35% of the world's economic activity. One of the main reasons America, particularly the United States, has achieved this pre-eminence is because of its assiduous routine collection of data on its own society, ranging from the very ordinary to the extraordinary. It is important that our society, which is successful and has full employment, rediscovers its interest in this particular area because, for years, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s, which were characterised by economic failure, there was also a systemic failure in the collection of basic raw information about our society, economy, people and their way of living. I am glad the Central Statistics Office has achieved a huge increase in its budget in recent years and that we are now seeing proper, reliable statistics that can inform the work of policymakers and lawmakers in their daily work [900]in the House and the work of civil servants outside the House in support of what we do. This Bill will only add to our capability in this regard and afford to us reliable information about our population at the touch of a button. I hope it can be made available to all Departments when there is a relevant issue to be inquired into. This is an extremely important part of the Bill. For the first time, we are using the new technology in the area of data capture and I hope it will be put to the service of policy development in the future. I commend the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, for her initiatives in this regard. Her Department has been a fantastic, innovative Department in the area of developing new technology and transparent, accountable and properly functioning systems of data collection, thus allowing the ordinary citizens who rely so often on us as public representatives to vindicate their rights regarding many social services. If we can master and develop this data collection system better, public representatives will not have to be in the position they are in week in, week out, whereby they have to intervene and gain access to the system to vindicate very basic rights and entitlements where a citizen feels he or she has been denied them because of poor paperwork or mistakes that have been made, however inadvertently. It is important that this Bill goes a great distance towards doing this. The Bill also helps us clarify the changing nature of our society. Deputy Seán Ryan rightly pointed this out in terms of marriage statistics and the changing nature of fatherhood and parenthood. The decline evident in our marriage statistics is remarkable, as is the growth in single parenthood. Instead of being conservative and looking at this as some sort of terrible thing, it is important to consider the more optimistic side. For instance, the statistics clearly show that many single parents enter a married or settled relationship within five years of their becoming single parents. According to one particular survey, two thirds of them do so. It is not all bad news, yet there is a tendency among the more conservative elements in this House and society in general to look with great trepidation at these changing social norms in terms of marriage, including second marriages, etc. We have to be open to the idea that it is not just a negative development and that it may, in the longer term, prove to be somewhat more positive than we now believe it to be. The Minister, who is a new Minister in the Cabinet, should be commended for the speed at which she is implementing this change in a Department that has generally innovated in terms of technology and made basic entitlements much more accessible. However, there is still a long way to go in this regard. The central register, as it develops under the framework set out in this Bill, will allow for the steady rolling out of those entitlements in a proper and transparent manner. The fact that 40% of the work associated with [901]the old register involved the generation of paper certificates is very instructive and underlines for us the huge importance we should attach to e-government and making our State one of the best in the world at providing electronic payments and information in a timely and proper way. This will give us a distinct advantage as we go forward, not just in respect of social services and their provision but also in respect of the private sector. I hope that within the lifetime of this Government, or its successor, we will be able to transact at least 90% of our business electronically, both in the private and public sectors. This would afford a significant competitive advantage to the country. We have a strong, literate, well-educated population relative to other countries, particularly the countries acceding to the European Union in May under our Presidency. We have a significant, embedded advantage in terms of literacy, general intelligence and educational qualifications and we should adopt electronic systems as fast as possible because it will be to our advantage economically, socially and in terms of vindicating the rights of the citizen. Given that we are a republic, this should be the central focus of all our efforts in this House and the efforts of all policymakers and civil servants. We are here to serve the public and ensure they get the basic information to which they are entitled as quickly as possible. I commend the Minister for Social and Family Affairs for establishing a committee in the Department to examine the effects of the public service identity number on other Departments. It is a positive development. The committee should examine the idea of a smart card for public services. Last weekend the former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, stated he supported the possible introduction of an identity card. It is crazy that we do not have one. We are an open country but, in this era of transparency and greater accountability, it is important that there should be an identity card system in order that people are not detained for too long by law enforcement agencies when their identity must be established. If people have nothing to hide, they should present their identity card and move on. It was refreshing to hear a former leader of the Labour Party advocating such a system. When I lived in England in the 1980s, there was a debate on an identity card system and those on the libertarian right and the far left came together in an unholy alliance to suggest that it was wrong and an intrusion on the part of the state into a person's individual freedoms. I fundamentally disagree. It is good to hear that Deputy Quinn advocates such a system. When we are collecting statistics and information about the population, it is important that there is system in place to vindicate rights quickly on production of an identity card. The smart card is designed to improve service delivery but once there is proper data protection, we [902]should consider the introduction of an identity card. It would assist all State agencies in their dealings with citizens, from law enforcement to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and from the Revenue Commissioners to immigration officers at airports who are seeking to establish if people have the right to be in the country. I also welcome the answer of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to a parliamentary question I asked yesterday on this topic. In the past two years 11,000 people who sought to remain here illegally were turned away or removed from the country. That is a good sign because it is wrong that nationals or non-nationals who have a legitimate right to be here are subject to a question mark about their presence as a result of illegal immigration. We must get tough on illegal immigration, an issue that affects all of Europe. Many speakers have referred to the sensitivity of the new provisions on stillbirths. They are positive and proper and allow hospital doctors and midwives, where births occur outside the institutions, to register them. They also allow for an extended period for people to register such tragic losses. Those who go through this experience a great deal of trauma and it is important that the State is not too rigorous and extends the period of notification. I welcome the fact that the identity of a person who gives up a child for adoption will not be made known except through a court order or an instruction of the Adoption Board, a positive development that has been confirmed in the Bill. It would be invidious if the situation were otherwise. Our population is rising once more and, as we try to consolidate the economic and social success of recent years, we must harness this system and use it properly for the efficient delivery of services. We must answer constituents' questions about entitlements but all Deputies accept that we would prefer not to be involved in such work. We must establish a State system that reflects our modernity and wealth. Transparent and efficient delivery of public services for citizens, proper systems of appeal and proper data collection are at the heart of that idea. If we do not collect the information properly, we will not be able to develop systems that benefit the citizen and society to the maximum extent. I served with the late Deputy Jim Mitchell on the Committee of Public Accounts and we were astounded week after week when we questioned Departments at the absence of recorded information. We often found policy was arrived without the requisite information or its close examination that should inform every decision made by the State or one of its agencies. It is vital that we get our act together. The Bill is a major milestone. For the first time since 1845 we are taking responsibility as a State and rigorously collecting our own information. I support an identity card system. It would be a positive move and overcome the recent decision [903]of the courts that an Irish-born person can be asked for evidence of identity but someone who is potentially an illegal immigrant with no right to be here cannot be challenged. We must correct that decision to ensure everyone enjoys the same rights and that those who are entitled to be here are granted their rights quickly. There is a whole industry in the House of our vindicating the rights of citizens that have been improperly denied. It would be better for the State as a whole if we were not involved in such work and spent more time on policy and decision-making. I commend the Bill and compliment the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on the work she is doing. She is a Minister of great promise and will go far because she has conducted herself with efficiency and aplomb in this difficult role. In the 1980s no one wanted to be the Minister in charge of social welfare and it is indicative of the changes that have occurred in our fortunes that no aspirant to ministerial office would object to being appointed to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The Department has also transformed itself from the bad old days when it grudgingly granted people their entitlements. There is a transparent system for the explaining and granting of rights, a major change for which the civil servants in the Department deserve credit. Members must deal with all Departments and dealings with the Department of Social and Family Affairs are always positive. The same cannot be said of certain other Departments in terms of their response times to our many and detailed queries. I commend the Department on its work. I congratulate the Minister and I commend the Bill to the House. It is not greatly controversial. It rightly enjoys cross-party support. We are dealing with the great eternals, birth, marriage and death. I welcome the continuance of the three-month notification requirement in terms of marriage. I wonder, though, whether it takes from the romance of the situation because there is now no possibility of a 'quickie' marriage in Ireland. It must be a long bureaucratic delayed process, albeit involving new technology.

There has been argument going on ever since between the man and the engineering staff in an effort to reach agreement. Deputy Molloy knows the spot fairly well between Aughrim and Cappatagle—on the national primary road—where one can see that entrance still there. It is a common disgrace on a public road. If you have not some reasonable way of giving a farmer a chance of putting up his case for at least a decent alternative to an entrance that may be closed, I think this amendment should be accepted.

2000176,413,9,86,Private Members' Business. - Government's Economic Policies: Motion (Resumed).,11/11/1981,Ms. Mary Flaherty,Fine Gael,Dublin North-West,"Yes. But it was £2 at the beginning of 1980. Deputies Woods and Lemass continued to refer to these mythical increases of 5p, 10p and 15p. I have made that point a number of times and I can only put it down to the most wicked intentions of Opposition Deputies to create this myth that that level of increase has been given. Nobody received an increase of only 5p, 10, or 15p in their pension. These increases were supplements to other payments made and the other payments were also increased. The increase in ESB charges was [1883] referred to. As the Deputy knows, the long-term recipients of social welfare payments, such as old age pensioners, blind pensioners and invalidity pensioners and others over pension age, receive a free electricity allowance, including a fixed number of units free of charge, 300 in the winter months. This allowance is not affected by increases in charges and is additional to the increased levels of pension provided which, as I have said, represent real increases in the case of the elderly. Petrol price increases and the effect on the economy were mentioned. Deputy Woods referred to an increase of 30p per gallon in the price of petrol between June and October of this year — from £1. 90 a gallon to £2. 26 a gallon. It must be remembered, however, that the application for 16p of the increase was made to the previous Government but a decision on the application was deferred until after the general election. Therefore, the actual increase in price under the present Government can be calculated as 20p or 10 per cent. It may be mentioned that the increase in the price of petrol in the calander year 1980 was 33p a gallon, or 27 per cent. Deputy Woods referred to the position of social welfare beneficiaries in the light of tax changes to be made in the forthcoming budget. In this regard the House may be assured that the Government will honour their commitments in the programme to safeguard the position of these beneficiaries. As the Minister said last night, she will be concerned to see that further substantial increases are provided to those dependent on social welfare. I am especially interested in the proposals regarding the child benefit scheme next year. In her closing remarks, Deputy Lemass referred to the potential value of the children's allowance scheme. Its potential value and the importance to the mother, particularly the mother with a large family on a low income, has been recognised by the Government and it has led to one of the most progressive proposals in the Government's programme — the proposal to replace the existing children's allowance and tax allowance [1884] for children with a child benefit scheme. The present tax free allowance for children will be abolished and replaced by an augmented child benefit scheme, payable to all mothers of dependent children. The substantially improved payment of £3 per week and £4 a week for the sixth and subsequent children will represent a major improvement in the circumstances of low income families. What is involved is a radical approach which will take family income support out of the tax system, which is designed for collecting revenue and not as a mechanism for channeling support to less well-off sections of the community. Under the new scheme State income support for families generally will be concentrated in one scheme, children's allowances, making the support more visible, more unified and of more value in its impact to those whose need is greatest. The present system of a tax free allowance was regressive in nature, being of more value to those on the higher tax rates. People whose incomes are below the tax threshold, the very people who need help most, get no benefit at all from these tax free proposals. There are such anomalies in our system. There are benefits that most people presume are going to those most in need but in general are benefiting those who are better off. This Government, in adopting such proposals, have shown their ingenuity, their commitment, and their ability to use the kind of research available in the area of progressive policies which will ensure the proper and full redistribution of wealth. This new scheme will result in some new redistribution of income from the higher paid to the less well off, but I should like to stress that the new benefits will apply to all families regardless of the income of the household. That is again recognising the importance of children, the maintenance of children and the role of the woman. The new benefit will represent a more realistic, independent income to the mother than the present children's allowance. Deputy Lemass poured cold water on the £9. 60. Whatever about its financial benefit, when it is added to the children's [1885] allowance it will effecitvely mean that the woman will have a significantly improved disposable income coming directly to her in recognition of her role as child-minder and of being in the home — a recognition long overdue and the least that women could expect. It will also benefit children for whom the mother still has the primary responsibility. The constant dig that this is coming from the husband's pocket is inaccurate. It is coming from an overall increase to the family through the new tax proposals. Instead of directing all the increase to the husband's pay packet, some of the increase is going directly to the wife. This will be extremely beneficial to low income families. I should like to come to the area that concerns me most. It is the area which is in my title and which Deputy Lemass suggested only became relevant in the last two months. If Deputy Lemass can say that, it is a shocking indictment of the total lack of knowledge of the seriousness, the extent and the history of the problem of poverty. The appointment of a Minister for Poverty is not an indication of a new problem. It is, for the first time in the history of the State, a recognition of a very real problem. In the few months since I was appointed, regardless of what I have done, the acknowledgment of the problem by the creation of that Ministry and that responsibility has raised the consciousness and has developed the debate in an extraordinary way. It is great credit to the Taoiseach that, in outlining areas of responsibility, he, and his Government should have established a whole new Ministry. The Government's programme includes a commitment to tackle poverty in our society. Deputy Leyden, in a previous debate, commented on the paltry amount of £100,000 which had been given to this committee. If one expects that money to be spent on direct services, it is a paltry amount but the Opposition do not seem to understand the importance of planning. This agency will have both a planning and an action role. The planning role is as important as the action role and that £100,000 is intended to establish an agency which will become the voice of the poor and a radical contribution to the whole debate on policies [1886] in this area. It will influence Departments and encourage Departments who spend a great deal more money to have a poverty responsibility in the finance which is already given to them for social spending. The £100,000 can influence a great deal more than the direct budget which it spends itself and in the budget there is a commitment to extending its scope. I consider the establishment of this committee as extremely important and I hope its role in the next few years will be one that will contribute to a radical change in our society. The Taoiseach referred to the challenge involved in admitting the existence of poverty and the need for redistribution of resources from the haves and the have-nots. In a time of recession this challenge would be resisted in some quarters but we are determined that any pressure to cut social services will not succeed or be tolerated. An anti-poverty plan will be drawn up and implemented within the context of national, economic and social planning leading to a more just distribution of wealth and income. The main task of the new agency will be to increase the understanding of the nature and extent of poverty through research and public education. I hope in this task that party political divides will be forgotten, because I am sure that on all sides of the House there are people equally concerned about the problem. Perhaps, when people are faced with the facts for the first time and with statistics and continuing pressure to acknowledge it, it may be something which will bring us together. One of the areas in which the national committee made specific recommendations was in relation to development of constructive community action. This will be one element of the agency's work. The Government also acknowledge the importance of voluntary, community-based organisations tackling social problems. We will ensure that these organisations are given proper recognition. There is, very importantly, the establishment of a special anti-poverty unit in the Department of Social Welfare, which will extend and develop the activities of the committee. In conclusion, in the short term and in [1887] their commitment to long-term planning this Government have shown that they are concerned with securing social justice for those who are dependent on social welfare, for those on very low incomes and with eliminating some of the inequality and injustice in our society.",11/11/1981,22,297,298,the increase in the price of petrol in the calander year 1980 was 33p a gallon or 27 per cent,Deputy Woods,referred to the position of social welfare beneficiaries in the light of tax changes to be made in the forthcoming,Deputy Woods,2000176_2,,the increase in the price of petrol in the calander year 1980 was 33p a gallon or 27 per cent Deputy Woods referred to the position of social welfare beneficiaries in the light of tax changes to be made in the forthcoming,the increase in the price of petrol in the calander year 1980 was 33p a gallon or 27 per cent referred to the position of social welfare beneficiaries in the light of tax changes to be made in the forthcoming,text910,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.105443924,0.002636098,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.597597598,0.570570571,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

679038,626,8,90,Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 13—General (Resumed).,11/05/1949,Mr. Seán F. Lemass,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South,"When I was unexpectedly interrupted by the adjournment of the Dáil last night in the course of my observations upon the Budget, I was trying to get the Government to face up to the urgency and seriousness of social and economic problems to realise the ineffectiveness of the measures which they have already taken and asking them to explain their failure to proceed with certain measures which they had announced. I do not wish to repeat any observations I made last night. No Deputy here fails to realise that this Government is pledged, in so far as public utterances can be held to pledge them to anything, to the reduction of taxation and to the reduction of the cost of living. So far as taxation is concerned, the fact that this year's Budget is estimated to secure a tax revenue of £64,500,000, or almost £7,000,000 more than the tax revenue secured in [928] 1947, makes it unnecessary to emphasise the Government's failure to carry out that specific pledge made in a most formal manner by the Minister for Finance in his first Budget statement of 1948. I am not going to argue that a reduction of taxation in the present circumstances is either practicable or desirable. It was the Minister for Finance who believed it to be practicable and who announced his intention of achieving it. It is the same Minister for Finance who this year has confessed his failure in that aim. It is probably true that the taxation now in force in relation to the present level of national production is as much as the country can meet and that if there is to be, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, an extension of Government expenditure under existing services or an inauguration of new services, the money for that purpose has got to be secured not by increasing the burden of taxation in advance of an expansion of production but by reducing the cost of some of the existing services. I am anxious, however, to obtain information as to the outlook of the Minister for Finance in this matter. For some reason he has not appeared in the House during the course of the debate on the Budget but presumably somebody has the responsibility of telling him what has been said and that when he comes to reply he will not speak in vacuo as usual but in some relation to the observations made by Deputies. Deputy Con Lehane, the first lieutenant in the House of that Minister who, with the compliments of the Director of the Government Information Bureau, is henceforth to be known as 'Ireland's New Man of Destiny'— it took him nine pages to establish his claim to that title—said in his statement in this debate that he agreed that henceforth the word 'economy' would disappear from the vocabulary of the Coalition. Whether that was a wise observation or not, it had the merit of frankness. The Minister for Finance could have said the same, but he did not. He just implied that he had examined all the possibilities for retrenchment and, as a result, had thrown in his hand. The most he could promise for the future was that [929] he would restrict the further expansion of Government expenditure. Deputy Lehane claimed that the disappearance of the policy of economy from the Budget statement and the word 'economy' from the Coalition vocabulary is due to the influence of the Clann na Poblachta Party. I must confess that I felt some sympathy for the Minister for Finance sitting there in the humiliating position of having to listen to a representative of the smallest and most ineffective Party in this House claiming to have forced him to abandon the policy to which he, more than any other member of the Government, was definitely tied. We all know, of course, that Deputy Lehane was talking nonsense, that the change in outlook and policy of the Minister for Finance was not due to the negligible influence of the Clann na Poblachta Party but to the fact that the Minister for Finance had, during the course of the past year, been forced to deal with hard facts and that he found it a very different occupation to making speeches when he was an Opposition Deputy criticising the Fianna Fáil Government. It is possible of course that he did not have that sense of humiliation to which I have referred, when listening to Deputy Lehane making that speech. I can well understand the present Minister for Finance deciding to allow Deputy Lehane to exercise his childish conceits. I can even understand him tolerating the expenditure of taxpayers' money, providing paper, ink, machinery, postage and civil servants to prepare this eulogy of 'Ireland's new man of Destiny.'",11/05/1949,13,672,674,the change in outlook and policy of the Minister for Finance was not due to the negligible influence of the,Clann na Poblachta,Party but to the fact that the Minister for Finance had during the course of the past year been forced,Clann na Poblachta,679038_4,,the change in outlook and policy of the Minister for Finance was not due to the negligible influence of the Clann na Poblachta Party but to the fact that the Minister for Finance had during the course of the past year been forced,the change in outlook and policy of the Minister for Finance was not due to the negligible influence of the Party but to the fact that the Minister for Finance had during the course of the past year been forced,text81,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,-0.079056942,-0.001976424,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.231231231,0.243243243,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

1038606,162,11,93,Committee on Finance. - Vote 3—Department of the Taoiseach (Resumed).,20/07/1960,Mr. James Carroll,Independent,Dublin South-West,"As an Independent and not as a member of the Government Party I hope I shall introduce a refreshing note. I do not feel it is the duty of an Opposition at all times to speak against Government policy and to express pessimism. Deputy Sherwin, my colleague from Dublin, is disappointed with the unemployment position and the failure of the Government to provide jobs. I hope I shall never again hear hackneyed utterances regarding 100,000 jobs and: 'Put your husbands out to work.' I have heard such utterances on more occasions than I care to remember. I am acquainted with the building trade. Whether it is due to emigration or some other factor, there are no skilled workers available in Dublin at present. I shall leave it to the House to decide whether that is due to emigration or whether we have at last turned the corner referred to by the last speaker. I hope we have turned the corner. The Government and, I am sure, their predecessors in office, must have the ambition to provide good government. I should like, in particular, to ask the Taoiseach about the means test and the ceiling. The matter is vitally important to people in need of help. Increases were sponsored by this House for Judges, civil servants, Deputies and others because of the increased cost of living. Old age pensioners and other people are being penalised to such an extent that it is a disgrace. I appeal to the Taoiseach to see that there is some change. The Taoiseach is responsible for Government policy. If he did nothing but help the people on whose behalf I speak in this matter so as to give them a measure of equity in our community, his leadership and direction would not be in vain. I referred on another occasion to a person who is penalised. He gave everything to the country and is one of only two, as I understand it, who has not benefited. The Act in question is preventing him from enjoying what normally would be his right.

3929503,1804,8,171,Health Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed).,10/12/2008,Ms. Máire Hoctor,Fianna Fáil,Tipperary North,"I am happy to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. The Bill gives effect to recent Government decisions to end the automatic entitlement to a medical card, irrespective of income, for people aged 70 and over, and to introduce new arrangements in order that the vast majority of these people will continue to have medical cards under a new income threshold. There are good policy reasons for introducing this legislation. In particular, it enables the ending of the high capitation fee for GPs that has been paid since 2001 only in respect of over 70 year olds who received a medical card by virtue of age rather than means. The fee was paid for approximately 38% of people aged 70 and over. People in general are pleased that the perverse incentive this special fee created between different GP practices is being ended. While some people do not want to admit it, GPs were willing to point out there was a high concentration of GP practices in our larger cities where incomes were higher while the number of practices in disadvantaged areas has reduced. This legislation will put an end to that and there will be equal spread of GP practices, which will be near people, and services will be provided to those who need them most. People aged 70 years and over are more likely to require regular access to health services and it is appropriate that additional support be put in place to enable their access to medical care. At the same time, it is consistent with the general approach of the GMS for many years and with the need to provide for financially sustainable schemes that the scheme should be limited to all but the top 5% of income earners among over 70s. There are, and will continue to be, pressing calls on scarce resources to meet the needs of many people across the range of health services. It is appropriate that we devote taxpayers’ funds to meet those needs. The number of people aged 70 and over in our population is 350,000. It is projected this number will increase to 363,000 by 2011, 433,000 by 2016 and 535,000 by 2021. We need to plan for, and provide, many health services for the people now aged 55 and over who will form the over 70s group at that time and use public resources in the most effective and fairest way to provide those services. It is easy for the Opposition to ignore our growing aging population as people, thankfully, live healthier and longer lives but the Government must address the projected figures and look after those who need care most. We must base the assessment on this and people’s ability to pay. As outlined by the Minister earlier, the continuation of the automatic medical card, and the high capitation fee paid for it, does not represent prudent or fair financial planning. We should concentrate on using resources for those with the greatest medical and financial need. The Bill provides that those who are aged 70 or over before 1 January 2009 and who had full eligibility on age grounds will continue to have full eligibility as long as their gross income from all sources does not exceed the specified limits. The medical card is evidence of full eligibility. These generous limits are €700 per week gross in the case of a single person, excluding any income from savings or similar investments whose principal value is €36,000 or less, and €1,400 per week gross in the case of a couple, excluding any income from savings or similar investments whose principal value is €72,000 or less. As the Minister said, a person who had automatic entitlement to a medical card, and, therefore, full eligibility, will continue to have full eligibility until 2 March 2009. Consequently, all persons can continue to use their medical card as normal until that date even if their gross income exceeds the relevant income limits set out in this legislation. The Government wants to ensure the process of self-assessment for elderly people will be much simplified compared to that required under the existing 'hardship' based scheme. Consequently, the HSE has been asked to ensure any assistance a person who is currently over 70 may need regarding self-assessment be made available on an administrative basis. [353]A much simplified means test will be arranged for people reaching 70 on or after 1 January to enable them to apply under the new arrangements. They will receive confirmation from the HSE that they have full eligibility and will continue to have full eligibility as long as their gross income does not exceed the relevant limit. The Government is also providing in this legislation for the dependants of people over 70. The Bill also includes a provision to amend the Health Contributions Act 1979 to provide an exemption from the health contribution for any person, who is or reaches the age of 70 on or after 1 January 2009. The amendment will exempt everybody over 70 from paying the contribution regardless of whether they fall into the categories exempted under section 11 of the 1979 Act. The legislation is designed to give effect to the Government’s decision to replace the automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over with a new arrangement based on gross income limits. As the Minister outlined in her contribution, she has examined a range of options to protect persons aged 70 and over who lose their spouse. I lobbied her to address this because this must be recognised as a difficulty. The medical card should not be lost on the death of a spouse and I understand, on the basis of work on this issue over the past number of weeks, that she proposes to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage in this regard. Opposition Members are suffering from amnesia. Deputy Enright was quick to quote the contributions of Government Members on this issue in 2001 but Deputy Noonan, when serving as Minister for Health and Children, stated on 19 December 1996: In those circumstances I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to all citizens aged 80 and over without reference to their means. I am satisfied the health boards will assess people according to their circumstances. Thankfully, the HSE continues to do so. Deputy McManus referred to millionaires with medical cards as an 'obscenity' in November 2004. She said: In Ireland millionaires have been created by our economic boom. In 2001 we know now 11 of these millionaires paid no tax at all. If any of these millionaires, whether tax paying or not, is over 70 years of age, they automatically qualify for a medical card. This is an obscenity when compared to the experience of ordinary hard working families.",10/12/2008,30,1067,1068,I am satisfied the health boards will assess people according to their circumstances Thankfully the HSE continues to do so,Deputy McManus,referred to millionaires with medical cards as an obscenity in November 2004 She said In Ireland millionaires have been created,Deputy McManus,3929503_3,,I am satisfied the health boards will assess people according to their circumstances Thankfully the HSE continues to do so Deputy McManus referred to millionaires with medical cards as an obscenity in November 2004 She said In Ireland millionaires have been created,I am satisfied the health boards will assess people according to their circumstances Thankfully the HSE continues to do so referred to millionaires with medical cards as an obscenity in November 2004 She said In Ireland millionaires have been created,text560,2,3,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.336472237,0.008411806,0.080064077,0.002001602,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.585585586,0.580580581,0.53953954,0.521521522,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
3712880,1841,9,181,Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill 2006: Report Stage (Resumed),01/11/2006,Dr. Liam Twomey,Fine Gael,Wexford,"I move amendment No. 15: In page 11, line 11, to delete 'Executive,' and substitute the following: 'Executive, and (iii) except in exceptional circumstances, not sooner than 12 months after the com[1106]mencement of the payment of a relevant subvention,'. Every opportunity should be taken to discuss the Bill in as much detail as possible. The aim of the amendment is to enable the HSE to allow patients to receive a subvention for a specific period. The difficulty is that the payment of a subvention can be queried almost within months of a patient receiving it. Subventions should not be reviewed for a certain period of time. They should be treated like medical cards which can be issued for three to six months. If a subvention is reviewed soon after it is given because information has been provided for the HSE which [1107]might not be true, it makes matters difficult for the patient involved. Many of the amendments are based on the one issue. I am disappointed the Minister of State is not reciprocating in any way with this side of the House. The Minister, Deputy Harney, stated that under the new policy no one would be forced to sell his or her house and that the HSE would not implement existing rules in such a way that people would lose their homes. This appeared on the website of Age Action Ireland. The Taoiseach implied that funding for the care of the elderly in the future had already been decided and that discussions had taken place with mythical stakeholders. I previously asked the Minister of State to identify these mythical stakeholders who had already decided it was perfectly valid to take the homes of elderly people in order to pay for their private nursing home care. He did not answer the question. It is clear that the words of the Minister to the effect that houses will not be taken from elderly people will have no value in years to come because they do not have any value today. We have already pointed out that patients are being forced to sell their homes to pay for their nursing home care. Therefore, her words have zero value. What will matter is legislation that is what we are discussing. The measly words of the Minister, the Minister of State and the Taoiseach will mean nothing when it is passed. Will the Minister of State indicate who are the stakeholders with whom he had discussions and who agreed that homes should be taken from elderly people? As he did not discuss the issue with anybody on this side of the House, it is clear that the stakeholders are not on this side. Who are they? Age Action Ireland stated its group was not involved and that it was against the legislation. With whom has the Minister of State had discussions? Who decided that homes would be taken from elderly people to fund their care? We now know this is Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats policy but we do not know with whom it was agreed. Fianna Fáil brings in everybody to discuss matters. It brings in IBEC and the trade unions. The elderly people who are engaged in this discussion would like to know who is representing them who allowed this proposal to go forward. It is most important that the Minister of State answers this question. We are aware the Government parties have no respect for the Dáil. They will be backtracking when this measure is reflected in the opinion polls. It will be suggested not much will be taken from elderly people but there will be a difference between what the parties will state in their general election manifestoes and what is contained in the legislation. The Minister can write on any website she wishes, including that of Fianna Fáil, that she will not take anybody’s home, but it is already happening. Her words and those of the Minister of State have no value. What matters is the legislation. This is different [1108]from regulations which can be and were interpreted differently by the CEO. Believe it or not, in the past ten months, when we knew the legislation would be brought forward, the HSE has been more inclined to stop elderly patients receiving subventions. The subvention rates have been the same since 2001 and there have been no discussions to increase them. An attempt to increase them might be made once the Government copperfastens the arrangements to deprive a large percentage of elderly people of the right to receive a subvention. The Minister of State must answer the questions asked. I asked about the figure of 5% as far back as 11 May in my Second Stage speech. The Minister of State avoided that question completely until he attempted to explain the situation in a press release issued before he was due to speak on 'The Last Word' with Matt Cooper on 12 October. No attempt was made to explain it clearly in the House. While he is here, will he indicate who are the stakeholders with whom he discussed the issue and who agreed to allow legislation under which the homes of elderly people would be taken from them to pass through the House? He should do so without further prevarication. Families will have some job in obtaining a subvention under this legislation as the Government will take everything into account and ensure families will have to go to a solicitor to sign off or risk being locked up in jail for a couple of months. If a family does succeed in obtaining a subvention, the elderly person concerned will deserve to receive it and hold on to it for a few months.",01/11/2006,29,640,641,manifestoes and what is contained in the legislation The Minister can write on any website she wishes including that of,Fianna Fáil,that she will not take anybody's home but it is already happening Her words and those of the Minister of,Fianna Fáil,3712880_5,,manifestoes and what is contained in the legislation The Minister can write on any website she wishes including that of Fianna Fáil that she will not take anybody's home but it is already happening Her words and those of the Minister of,manifestoes and what is contained in the legislation The Minister can write on any website she wishes including that of that she will not take anybody's home but it is already happening Her words and those of the Minister of,text447,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.221359436,0.005533986,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.783783784,0.72972973,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
1170974,666,9,8,Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 11—General (Resumed).,15/04/1964,Mr. Seán (Major-General) Mac Eoin,Fine Gael,Athlone-Longford,"We introduced levies to bring in £3 million for capital expenditure, not for Supply Services, and we have never been allowed to forget it from that day to this, but Fianna Fáil can bring in taxation of £24 million without any question at all for Supply Services, not capital expenditure. I shall deal with their capital Budget in a moment. I am now talking of their day-to-day expenditure. When the Taoiseach blandly said that in three years the inter-Party Government did not give any increase to social welfare recipients, he did so with his tongue in his cheek. We did give the increases. But we did more than that. We kept the £9 million worth of food subsidies in operation. When Fianna Fáil took those off, they could have given the old age pensioners and all the social welfare recipients a rise of 22/6d. a week if they had wanted to because that is what they took from them. They could have increased the whole social welfare payments then by no less than 22/6d. a week but they did not. They gave them 2/6d. again. They are great with halfcrowns. They seem to have a sort of affection for the halfcrown. They did not like the crown, I suppose, and the halfcrown does: we shall leave it at that. The thing that strikes me about this Budget is its similarity to the British Budget. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer set out to reduce spending. He set out to stop the spending spree. He set out to reduce the spending power of the people by imposing the £100 million additional taxation and he had the courage to say that that was what he was doing. It may not be good politics for him to say it—I do not know whether it is or not—but at least he told the people what he was doing. Fianna Fáil increased taxation with the same objective—remember, it [1794] is to reduce the purchasing power of the people—but they have not the courage to say it. They will take it in and the reason I assert that is this. There is no doubt about it any Government with a Budget today of over £200 million estimated expenditure for the ensuing year could not say that there would be over-estimation by at least 5 per cent—and 5 per cent on £200 million, 1/- in the £, means £10 million. There is no over-estimation this year. There is no £2 million or £3 million, even. It was £2 million or £3 million in the last Budget but, this year, there is none. What does that mean, exactly? It means, as far as Supply Services are concerned, that the Minister for Finance has abdicated. He is saying to every Government Department: 'Spend, boys, as much as you like. There is no restriction. You may spend everything in that Book of Estimates and you can fire away. I shall not control you.' Thereby, he is failing to carry out the duties which are assigned to the Minister for Finance. It is part of the duties of the Minister for Finance of any Government, and here, in particular, because of our peculiar circumstances, to carry out the financing of the country in the very same way as a first-class mother of a household would do in the running of the household. She is not to give all the children the right to say: 'We shall spend what we like' because, if she does, there is trouble. There is no point in labouring the matter further but they will take that £10 million from the people which, in my opinion, they do not want. At least, if it is not £10 million, it is £3 million. On £160 million the year before last, it was £3½ million for over-estimation. Last year it was £3 million. This year, there is not a shilling. There is the most accurate calculation ever done by Departments——",15/04/1964,17,122,123,the increases But we did more than that We kept the 9 million worth of food subsidies in operation When,Fianna Fáil,took those off they could have given the old age pensioners and all the social welfare recipients a rise of,Fianna Fáil,1170974_2,,the increases But we did more than that We kept the 9 million worth of food subsidies in operation When Fianna Fáil took those off they could have given the old age pensioners and all the social welfare recipients a rise of,the increases But we did more than that We kept the 9 million worth of food subsidies in operation When took those off they could have given the old age pensioners and all the social welfare recipients a rise of,text593,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.016076867,0.000401922,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.45045045,0.445445445,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
4013834,10,8,86,National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed).,06/10/2009,Mr. Noel Ahern,Fianna Fáil,Dublin North-West,"Whatever, but that was the way it went. In the 15 months, life has moved on. We have had the guarantee of deposits and liabilities and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, along with the acquisition of 25% shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland. We now have billions of euro in impaired loans and banks are not servicing the economy, as we know. However, we must deal with it and move on. NAMA is purchasing loans of €77 billion from the various financial institutions, for which we are paying €54 billion. Each loan will need to be assessed and valued independently, but I am surprised that the valuations to date have come out so high. House prices are down by about 30%, but I thought development land would have fallen much more in price. I know the line that when somebody borrowed €100 million, theoretically that was only 75% of the investment, but I wonder about it. The most similar event I can recall is the winding up of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. After years in the Department of Finance, there must have been some conclusion to the file and recommendations about how to handle similar events in the future. I would love to hear from the Department about these recommendations. I can remember times when the banks were making major profits and we were all still paying levies to make up for the decision made back in the 1980s. That is my biggest fear this time. NAMA will work fine — that is not a fear. However, I look into the future and see the banks making great profits again in ten or 15 years, while much of the residue — or crap, if I may use that horrible, unparliamentary word — is still left in NAMA. Are we, as taxpayers and as the State, properly protected in this Bill? How do we need to change it in this regard? I particularly like the arrangement that has been made to date whereby we have made a capital investment in Bank of Ireland and AIB in return for 25% equity, as well as dividends in the future. However, if we must give all these resources, in whatever form, to the banks, I would like to have more equity. I hope such things can be considered on Committee Stage. My problem is not so much with the €7 billion long-term economic value — in fact, I was surprised that figure was not higher — but the €9 billion in rolled-up interest that we are taking over. What are we getting for that €9 billion? I know what we are getting in terms of the long-term economic value of the €7 billion. That is reasonable, as one can only expect property values to rise into the future. However, for the €9 billion, we should be getting an equity stake and we should be buying it at the share price that prevailed some months ago and not the current price. It is on those points I have my concerns and I hope we can consider such things on Committee Stage to strengthen the Bill and give the State and the taxpayer more protection. It is proposed to make lobbying NAMA a criminal offence, although I do not know whether such a provision is in the Bill yet. Of course, any attempt to influence the valuations would be terribly wrong and should be an offence, but we must be careful that we are not becoming daft with such provisions. I hope that if Deputy Noel Ahern were to write a letter or two to NAMA it would not be decided on the basis of a response to an FOI request in two, five or ten years’[386]time that he was improperly lobbying. We must be careful what we put into such legislation because sometimes it can be daft. Everyone is against improper lobbying, but when a Deputy writes letters it is not the letters that do any harm. We have this Bill and we cannot afford to waste a year going back to square one. It may not be perfect, but let us pass Second Stage and get on with Committee Stage so we can improve it for the good of society and the taxpayer and for our future. In addition, as Deputy Higgins said, we need to include a guarantee that the banks do not just take the money and fatten their balance sheets with it. It must be rolled over so that we achieve the outcome for which we hope.",06/10/2009,30,588,589,offence but we must be careful that we are not becoming daft with such provisions I hope that if Deputy,Noel Ahern,were to write a letter or two to NAMA it would not be decided on the basis of a response,Noel Ahern,4013834_2,,offence but we must be careful that we are not becoming daft with such provisions I hope that if Deputy Noel Ahern were to write a letter or two to NAMA it would not be decided on the basis of a response,offence but we must be careful that we are not becoming daft with such provisions I hope that if Deputy were to write a letter or two to NAMA it would not be decided on the basis of a response,text569,1,2,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.510825624,0.012770641,0.231115063,0.005777877,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.592592593,0.803803804,0.748748749,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

2984105,515,9,142,"Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1998: Committee and Remaining Stages.",02/07/1998,Mr. Jim Higgins,Fine Gael,Mayo East,"(Mayo): Absolutely. There is an inconsistency in the figures. Just over ten days ago, the first press statement put out jointly by the Minister and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, had two contradictions within it. One, from the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said 4,000 people, while the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands [1256] referred to 3,000. That was repeated today so, obviously, there was no co-ordination. From the point of view of someone who vaunted himself in Opposition as being the Minister for zero tolerance, it is appalling to bring about a fundamental relaxation in gun laws, of all things, which will allow a dilution of laws that have stood us in good stead. The Minister will be singularly culpable if anything disastrous happens, as could well occur in the kind of global village the world has become. It is there in black and white. The Minister is saying that notwithstanding anything in sections 4 or 8 of the Firearms Act, 1925, he will dilute the legislation that has stood us in good stead. Section 4 of the Firearms Act, 1925, states: Before granting a firearm certificate to any person under this Act the superintendent of the Garda Síochána or the Minister (as the case may require) shall be satisfied that such person—— (a) has a good reason for requiring the firearm in respect of which the certificate is applied for, and (b) can be permitted to have in his possession, use, and carry a firearm or ammunition without danger to the public safety or to the peace, and (c) is not a person declared by this Act to be disentitled to hold a firearm certificate. Section 8 of the Act sets down the categories of people who would be disentitled, including any person under the age of 15, of intemperate habits, of unsound mind, who has a criminal conviction, who is subject to the supervision of the police, or is bound to keep the peace. The Minister is effectively watering this down. One only has to look at the wording in section 1(1) of the Bill: the Minister, before granting a firearm certificate to a person not ordinarily resident in the State, shall be of the opinion that the application is bona fide and that there is no good reason to refuse to grant the certificate. How will he form the opinion on whether the application is bona fide? If I come into the country from Brussels and apply for a firearm certificate for five days shooting rights in County Mayo, what check will be carried out on me in this jurisdiction by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the provisions of the Firearms Act, 1925? What consultation was there with the Garda Síochána? Was there any meeting with the Garda Commissioner as to whether the Garda authorities are satisfied with this relaxation? The Minister has vaunted the European pass as one of the qualifications for getting a certificate. Has he read the judgment of Mr. Justice Quirke when he spoke about such passes in the most disparaging terms? Such a pass is obtainable on request by citizens of many European states [1257] which have not even enacted firearms legislation and where hunting licences are readily available without any investigation. This is the documentation the Minister is talking about as allowing somebody to come here and qualify under our existing stringent legislation. Section 1 is a dilution of the existing law — a watery, imprecise requirement which is both ineffectual and a nonsense. It is a fig leaf to provide 3,000 or 4,000 people with firearms certificates and save the tourist season that is under threat because the Minister will not set out a simple questionnaire that we sought as a means of establishing whether somebody is qualified to hold such a licence. Section 1(3)(b) states: In any case, any other permit, licence, authorisation or other document duly issued by an appropriate authority or body outside the State which the Minister considers acceptable. Why has the Minister not inserted the words, 'any other document authorising the carrying of a firearm'? 'Any other document' could be a television licence, a dog licence or a dipping certificate. I have never come across more rushed, ineffective and careless legislation than this. It should state in clear and unequivocal terms 'any other document authorising the carrying of a firearm'. On Second Stage I said that this would be open to a constitutional challenge and it is. We are enacting legislation which sets down so-called specific requirements for non-residents. It could be a non-resident Irish person. An Irish person working in Brussels could decide to come to this jurisdiction and avail of the new lax regime the Minister is introducing. However, the same person's brother who is domiciled in this jurisdiction would have to be rigidly bound by the provisions of the Firearms Act, 1925. The Minister is introducing two different regimes, not alone between European and Irish citizens but between Irish citizens living in this jurisdiction and those living abroad. The Minister can rest assured this will be challenged and it will be struck down. What Deputies Stagg, McManus, Naughten and I have said will be fully vindicated. The Minister is going down the wrong road in this regard. It is a foolish, careless and dangerous road.",02/07/1998,28,44,45,Minister and the Minister for Arts Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands had two contradictions within it One from the Minister,Deputy O'Donoghue,"said 4,000 people while the Minister for Arts Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands 1256 referred to 3,000 That was repeated",Deputy O'Donoghue,2984105_1,,"Minister and the Minister for Arts Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands had two contradictions within it One from the Minister Deputy O'Donoghue said 4,000 people while the Minister for Arts Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands 1256 referred to 3,000 That was repeated","Minister and the Minister for Arts Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands had two contradictions within it One from the Minister said 4,000 people while the Minister for Arts Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands 1256 referred to 3,000 That was repeated",text181,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,0,0,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.323323323,0.323323323,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1,0

Deputy Ardagh is correct, the entire judgment made horrifying reading. Wise and learned opinion was quoted from a former US Supreme Court Associate Justice, Mr. Justice Thurgood Marshall, in giving the Supreme Court’s decision in the Shortt case. It gave a clear message to the Legislature, and I suppose to the Judiciary too, not to rely simply on verbal evidence from anybody, no matter how eminent, or to give the supposition that the word of one category of individual, a policeman or policewoman, is always correct and always superior to anybody else’s evidence. The Tánaiste is doing that in this Bill. It runs counter to the spirit of the Shortt judgment and the clear warning we got from the Supreme Court on these matters. I recall that in the last Criminal Justice Bill there was a proposition to give additional powers to the gardaí in the case of search warrants which we removed on foot of the most recent batch of reports from the Morris tribunal because of that issue, that we had to be careful giving authority. This is fundamental. It relates to the liberty of individuals on the word of any individual. We must deal with great care with that matter. I am obliged to Deputy Ardagh for reminding me.

4310869,2173,8,43,Mahon Tribunal Report: Statements (Resumed),28/03/2012,Mr. Michael McGrath,Fianna Fáil,Cork South-Central,"I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Mahon tribunal or as it is formally known, the Final Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. While many people suspected endemic corruption in our planning system during the years under scrutiny by this tribunal, and perhaps even to this day, it was nonetheless shocking for the full nature and extent of it to be laid bare in this final report of the tribunal. It is riveting if depressing reading. It upsets me greatly that elected persons, entrusted by ordinary people, would betray that trust and use their privileged position to enrich themselves and those around them. The Mahon tribunal has done the State considerable service by shining a light on corrupt behaviour in our democratic institutions. For that alone, it was worthwhile. The debate about the cost and length of the tribunal is a legitimate one but for another day. Given that this report dealt solely with planning matters in Dublin, it is inevitable questions will arise as to whether the same practices and the same standards prevailed elsewhere in the country. I can only speak from my experience as a town and county councillor in County Cork. I have never witnessed corruption and I have not known of anyone to accept a bribe. We would be naive to think, however, that the temptation of easy money in return for political favours did not exist elsewhere. Of course it did and it was not resisted by all. For that reason alone, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, should reinstate the inquiries into the six local authority areas in the manner originally constituted by the previous Government. I know that those inquiries were not dealing with allegations of corruption but changing them from independent, external inquiries to in-house inquiries was the wrong decision and should be changed. While the report of the tribunal deals with public representatives from several parties, my party, Fianna Fáil lies at the heart of it. That is the harsh reality our leader Deputy Martin, I and my colleagues have had to face up to in recent days. The revelations concerning some former Fianna Fáil public representatives are deplorable. As a young public representative and as someone in politics for the right reasons, I am embarrassed and saddened by the actions of some of those who used the Fianna Fáil label as a vehicle for corrupt personal benefit. It also saddens me that Bertie Ahern who led our party for 14 years and served as Taoiseach for three terms, a man of considerable achievements, was found not to have given truthful accounts to a tribunal of inquiry established by this House. This is a most serious finding. That is why we as a party have acted decisively since the report was published less than a week ago. People who have been guilty of any wrongdoing now need to face up to the consequences of their actions. The full rigours of the law must to be applied. There will simply have to be consequences for the people concerned. Page 2,649 of the Mahon report recommends the Prevention of Corruption Act 1889 be extended to cover Oireachtas Members. This change would effectively allow for the politicians found to have been bribed to lose their pensions. The Government must act to immediately implement this recommendation and to examine other ways of updating and strengthening this legislation dealing with politicians found guilty of corruption. Apart from the obvious public disgrace faced by politicians who have been bribed, there also must be a financial penalty. It is not acceptable that politicians who have been found to have disgracefully abused public office to enrich themselves would continue to receive lucrative pensions from the taxpayer. It will not be possible to rebuild public confidence in politics until ordinary people see there are consequences for politicians who act in this way. The Fianna Fáil of 2012 is a different party from the Fianna Fáil of previous years. I am not just referring to the obvious difference in size following last year’s emphatic general election defeat. There is no place in our party today for people who seek to abuse their positions. We have a long road to travel to rebuild trust with the Irish people. The only way my party can recover is to accept in full all of the past failings and to renew ourselves based on the basic principles of honesty and integrity in everything we do in public life. I know in my heart that the actions of these politicians do not reflect the character of the members of our party throughout the country nor of the majority of the party’s former and current elected members. As a party, we will not allow the actions of a small number of selfish people, some of whom have been found to be corrupt, to hijack our 86-year history, which includes so many notable achievements for the country. The overwhelming majority of people who have been elected for Fianna Fáil, including those who have served in high office, were honourable and never had their personal integrity called into question. They must be remembered. I do not need to look as far back as Jack Lynch, Seán Lemass or so many others from that generation for inspiration. I can point to honourable people from Fianna Fáil who served this country without a hint of impropriety in recent years, for example, Dr. Rory O’Hanlon, Dr. Michael Woods, the late Brian Lenihan and many others. The qualities they demonstrated in their public duties embody the true spirit of the party. In time, we will permanently and resolutely detach from Fianna Fáil the stench of corruption that a small number of disgraced former members brought upon us. On issues of ethics, transparency and accountability in our political and financial affairs, we need to go further than other parties to demonstrate our good faith. We will do so. The manner in which we have responded to the tribunal’s report is but one small step on that journey. Public confidence in all things political ebbed away in recent years as tales of corruption emerged, and not just from this report. The truth is that many people believe that most or even all politicians are on the take or are at least only in it for themselves. Everyone who is elected knows this is not true. We must be honest and admit that the issues that flow through the Mahon tribunal report are far broader than those pertaining to Fianna Fáil. They run to the core of Ireland’s political system and political culture. Other parties, in particular Fine Gael, will need to deal with the serious issues that the Mahon report raises for them. Can we really look into our hearts and say politics in this country has changed? There have been great strides in terms of ethics legislation and the regulations governing the funding of political parties and individual politicians. Many of those strides occurred under Fianna Fail. However, my sense is that we have a long distance to travel yet. Fianna Fáil will do what it must to face up to its challenges, but there are some uncomfortable questions for the parties currently holding the reigns of power. Consider the pattern of big business fund-raising in Fine Gael as highlighted by the Moriarty tribunal. Is there any evidence that the party’s reliance on financial support from the corporate sector has changed? Consider the pattern of appointments to public bodies since the Government entered office. Many still appear to be motivated by political patronage. Persons who have been appointed to prestigious public positions are known to have made substantial donations to the Ministers who subsequently appointed them. Why do all political parties not publish their accounts in full to remove any suspicion that money is still buying political influence? As a body politic, we should go the distance and introduce the maximum possible level of transparency to all aspects of the funding of political parties. The temptations that those exposed in the Mahon and previous tribunals could not resist will inevitably offer themselves to those who find themselves in power. Undoubtedly, the long number of years for which Fianna Fáil was in power contributed to the abandonment of standards among some. Fine Gael, as the largest party in the country and one that could well be in power for many years to come, would do well to remember the following quotation from Lord Acton: 'Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' We need to ensure that controls are put in place so that power, even a prolonged period in power, does not corrupt anyone. This is a collective responsibility, not just one for those in government. I am glad to have had the opportunity to put these points on the record in the wake of the publication of the Mahon report.",28/03/2012,31,336,337,decision and should be changed While the report of the tribunal deals with public representatives from several parties my party,Fianna Fáil,lies at the heart of it That is the harsh reality our leader Deputy Martin I and my colleagues have,Fianna Fáil,4310869_2,,decision and should be changed While the report of the tribunal deals with public representatives from several parties my party Fianna Fáil lies at the heart of it That is the harsh reality our leader Deputy Martin I and my colleagues have,decision and should be changed While the report of the tribunal deals with public representatives from several parties my party lies at the heart of it That is the harsh reality our leader Deputy Martin I and my colleagues have,text371,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.276699295,-0.006917482,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.071071071,0.103103103,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0
3331738,709,8,115,Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill 2002: Report Stage.,05/02/2003,Mr. Charlie McCreevy,Fianna Fáil,Kildare,"I wish to make a general point on this legislation and the Dormant Accounts Act 2001. At the moment, the balance of advantage lies with the insurer or the bank because the money is in some person's account and the bank has use of it in its reserves to generate profits. It is in the interests of the insurance company, therefore, to make sure to contact Mr. A at his last known address because if it does not, and unless Mr. A says he is alive and wants to do more business with it or take the money out now, the money will leave the bank account of the insurance company and be transferred to the State and into the dormant accounts fund. It will then be dispersed for the purposes laid out in the Act. In both the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and this Bill, it is in the insurance companies' own financial interests to try to make contact with customers holding accounts above the threshold of €500. If they do not make contact and there are no customer-initiated transactions, the money will go to the Exchequer and they will no longer have use of it. People like Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and me felt for a number of years that this was not correct and that something should be done about it. As Minister for Finance I am lucky enough to be in a position to do something about it. All kinds of advice about the difficulties of doing this were visited upon previous holders of this office. I recognise there are difficulties but we have done this for banking institutions in the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and now we are doing it for life assurance policies. It may be possible to do this in other areas in years to come. It is in the interests of life assurance companies to find an account holder at the last known address. Judging by the tenor of some of the amendments this is not widely understood. Banks are currently making an all-out effort to contact customers because 31 March is the cut-off date. Less than one year ago €400 million was held in accounts that had been dormant for 15 years and two months ago that had decreased to €250 million because the banks are reactivating accounts. To my personal knowledge, branches have gone to extraordinary lengths to contact their customers in recent weeks because they know if they do not make contact the money will go to the Exchequer. I imagine the same rules will apply with insurance companies. Regarding the amendments, balance must be reached between the aim of reuniting people with their moneys and not placing an undue administrative burden on the financial institutions, especially as any costs involved will be passed on to the consumer. The full burden of keeping track of the policy should not lie solely with the company the individual must also take some responsibility. [1084]Most low value policies have not yet been computerised and this has involved a lengthy manual trawl of paper records as insurance companies have to notify these customers. Considering the value of such policies this does not seem to be worthwhile at this time. This is particularly true in the case of old industrial branch policies sold by door-to-door salespersons – I was married when a policy taken out by my mother many years previously matured and it came to the princely sum of £92 10/-. Bearing in mind the case of such policies there are often very few contact details available. The policies were often sold door-to-door by salespersons who knew their customers personally and did not see the need to record accurate contact details. In these incidences, we accept the proposal to remove the threshold altogether at this time. It would be impossible for the insurance undertakings to comply with the law. Section 9(7) of the Bill provides that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs can alter the €500 threshold. Undertakings have already tried to contact these customers to no avail. In any case it is in their interests to pull out all the stops in doing this so as not to lose the underlying funds while still having to maintain the policies. As my Department has been drafting this Bill for some time, the industry has been preparing for the onset of a new regime. Since publication of the Bill, companies have been trying to identify policies valued above €500 and the Irish Insurance Federation advises that it has been developing new software to assist with this. To remove or change the threshold at this point will cause not inconsiderable problems for the sector. There is nothing to prevent the undertakings from writing to all customers or doing so more than once – this is likely to happen in any case. Since the dormant scheme came on stream last March, the number and value of accounts reactivated has been significant. Four advertisements will be placed this year regarding this new scheme, two by the insurance industry, one on behalf of the banks and building societies and one on behalf of An Post. This should bring the scheme into the public consciousness. The right to reclaim is statutorily guaranteed. Once records relating to these low-valued policies are finally computerised and the backlog of unclaimed policies has been cleared, it might then be appropriate to lower or remove the threshold. For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.",05/02/2003,29,200,202,customer-initiated transactions the money will go to the Exchequer and they will no longer have use of it People like,Deputy Jim O'Keeffe,and me felt for a number of years that this was not correct and that something should be done about,Deputy Jim O'Keeffe,3331738_1,,customer-initiated transactions the money will go to the Exchequer and they will no longer have use of it People like Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and me felt for a number of years that this was not correct and that something should be done about,customer-initiated transactions the money will go to the Exchequer and they will no longer have use of it People like and me felt for a number of years that this was not correct and that something should be done about,text346,0,2,1,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.171791138,0.004294778,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.713713714,0.66966967,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

Deputy O'Malley pointed out that it can happen that an increase can be in operation for four-and-a-half to five months before it would come before the House. Therefore, a levy increase would be implemented without the permission of the House.

4288703,580,9,147,Leaders&rsquo Questions,14/02/2012,Mr. Enda Kenny,Fine Gael,Mayo West,"I am glad the Deputy welcomes the fact that a plan has been produced. This plan is going to be implemented and it is my view and that of the Government that it will vastly improve the climate for the development of jobs and exports. We pointed out yesterday that we expect 10,000 jobs in the green economy by 2015, 7,200 jobs in food added value by 2020, 2,500 in digital gaming by 2014 — the Deputy will be aware of recent announcements in that regard — 10,000 jobs in international financial services by 2016 and 12,500 jobs in the new IDA supported areas by 2012. A recent report produced by Microsoft said cloud computing has potential for creating 8,500 jobs by 2014. Clearly this is an area with massive opportunity and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, addressed it with the EMC company yesterday in terms of cloud computing. I too met the American ambassador yesterday. I was proud to meet Mr. Rooney given the work he does for relations between Ireland and the United States. At the meeting convened by former President Clinton in New York last week, the point was made clearly by serious investors from around the world that two issues are important to bear in mind. When rating agencies look at countries they investigate political stability and the capacity for generating economic growth. At least in this country the contract between Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government acknowledges this is a challenging time which is not easy for many people but when we get through this economic challenge the rewards and benefit for the country will be great. We have many hundreds of engines in this country to drive our economy. We must have a sense of creating that environment and atmosphere, and a sense of belief and conviction to carry it through. For investors from abroad, these characteristics are very strong and they put Ireland in a different place than that of many other countries. They should never be forgotten in that context. Austerity on its own is never going to work but we have a problem in that we have to close a gap because we are spending €16 billion more than we are taking in. As I have stated previously, if we never had a problem in Europe, that would be a problem for us. The money we can save when we deal with that can be spent on jobs, hospitals, schools and other things that are important to our people. The Government does not have all the answers but we have made 270 proposals which I intend to see implemented and will oversee with all the Ministers and 36 State agencies. I hope the consequence is that young men and women will have the opportunity to work and live in their own country, if that is what they wish.",14/02/2012,31,239,240,countries they investigate political stability and the capacity for generating economic growth At least in this country the contract between,Fine Gael,and the Labour Party in government acknowledges this is a challenging time which is not easy for many people but,Fine Gael,4288703_2,,countries they investigate political stability and the capacity for generating economic growth At least in this country the contract between Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government acknowledges this is a challenging time which is not easy for many people but,countries they investigate political stability and the capacity for generating economic growth At least in this country the contract between and the Labour Party in government acknowledges this is a challenging time which is not easy for many people but,text616,1,3,1,0,40,0.05,2,0.84729786,0.021182447,-0.268793601,-0.00671984,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.651651652,0.63963964,0.077077077,0.107107107,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4373832,250,9,43,Written Answers Nos. 535-557,16/10/2012,Mr. Simon Coveney,Fine Gael,Cork South-Central,"My Department has confirmed a finding of the Chalara fraxinea disease at a site in County Leitrim and as a result is carrying out a number of measures. Department officials are working with the owner of the site involved to destroy the material and remove the risk of the disease spreading. Ash plants used from the same imported consignment related to the outbreak are also being destroyed. In addition, my Department is introducing emergency measures under the Plant Health Directive. These new measures being introduced by the Department under Statutory Instrument will require that any ash plants imported into the country would come from an area known to be free of the disease. My colleague at the Department, Minister of State Shane McEntee TD, has met with representatives from the forest nursery sector, Coillte and the hurley manufacturers to brief them on the disease and to update them on the measures being taken by the Department. The forest nursery trade agreed to comply with Minister McEntee’s request to impose a voluntary moratorium on imported stock from Europe with immediate effect. The hurley manufacturers also agreed to call on its members to ensure that ash wood for hurley making is either imported from countries free of the disease or that any hurley ash being imported from Continental Europe would be in plank form and with the bark sawn off.

3647350,1822,11,85,National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill 2006: Second Stage.,09/03/2006,Mr. Finian McGrath,Independent,Dublin North Central,"Was he on the hurling team? Did he turn up for the hurling match? I commend the Oireachtas football team and Deputy Deenihan for the work they have done and the amount of money they have raised for GOAL and other charities since I entered the House. When one examines the details of this legislation, one can see that the Government has approved the creation of the national sports campus development authority to oversee the planning and development of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown in Dublin 15. The Bill’s primary purpose is to provide the statutory basis for this authority, which I welcome. Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill provide for the making of an order by the Minister to set a date for the establishment of the authority, which will be known as the national sports campus development authority and which will have, with the approval of the Minister and the consent of the Minister for Finance, the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land and other property. I hope that if someone comes up with a sensible idea which will benefit sport and communities in Ireland, the Minister for Finance will not stand in the way. Section 7 describes the authority’s functions. The primary functions of the authority are to develop a sports campus on the site in Abbotstown furnish, equip, manage, operate and maintain it and encourage and promote its use by professional and amateur sportspeople and members of the public. Section 7 is important because it deals with the professional and amateur aspects, and there is a role for both. We have an extra onus to ensure those involved directly in amateur sport get priority under the plan. A development plan for the campus must be submitted for approval by the Minister and the Government before the commencement of each phase. Details of the phases must also be submitted for approval. I welcome some of the progressive developments that have taken place in the FAI under the leadership of John Delaney. There is a sense of excitement and expectation. It is a new management team who have massive knowledge and experience. The planning application has been lodged for the new stadium and an agreement has been reached on Croke Park, which is a brave and popular decision. In the meantime, we are preparing for the Euro 2008 qualifiers, which will give another boost to the country and create positive energy. I welcome the Government’s approval for the sports campus. While these are the big events, as Members we must ensure the local events get priority. I urge people to support their local clubs because these are the backbone of the national bodies. These clubs bring the children up through [852]the system and make a contribution in their local communities. As I said earlier, clubs like St. Vincent’s in Marino, Craobh Chiaráin in Donnycarney, Clontarf GAA club, Whitehall Colmcille and Parnell GAA club have made a massive contribution to the community spirit in my constituency. Section 24 allows the Minister to give general policy directions to the authority. As the Minister is elected by the people, it is an important aspect. While it is right to put an emphasis on amateur sport and health and fitness, access to sport for people with disabilities should also be taken into account. Social inclusion means making it possible for people with disabilities to become involved in sport in their communities. We saw an example of this during the Special Olympics where people got involved and a buzz was created around the activities, particularly the event in Croke Park. I was there with my family and many parents and friends of people with disabilities, and the way in which the children were directly involved played a major part in involving them in the community spirit. I urge the Minister to deal with this issue in a positive and constructive way. The arts are also important for society. They are something that people may not take seriously, but they are important for children. While there may be children in the system who are not especially interested in sport, they may be interested in music and the arts. There should be no elitism in the development of this area. Section 29 provides that the authority or a subsidiary may borrow with the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 30 provides that the authority may, for the purposes of providing access, acquire by agreement or, in accordance with Schedule 2, compulsorily, any land adjoining the Abbotstown site or any interest in or right over such land. Schedule 2 details the provisions relating to the compulsory acquisition of the land referred to in section 30, including that such acquisition must be authorised by an order made by the Minister. This is an important aspect. When dealing with planning issues, we must ensure that local people are directly involved and considered in a positive manner. I thank the Minister and commend him on bringing this important legislation before the House. Sport is not just about the cream of society but about everyone. Everyone should get involved in sport and in their local club. They should choose the sport they like and make a contribution to the club, society and the country.",09/03/2006,29,22,23,he on the hurling team Did he turn up for the hurling match I commend the Oireachtas football team and,Deputy Deenihan,for the work they have done and the amount of money they have raised for GOAL and other charities since,Deputy Deenihan,3647350_1,,he on the hurling team Did he turn up for the hurling match I commend the Oireachtas football team and Deputy Deenihan for the work they have done and the amount of money they have raised for GOAL and other charities since,he on the hurling team Did he turn up for the hurling match I commend the Oireachtas football team and for the work they have done and the amount of money they have raised for GOAL and other charities since,text846,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.252982213,0.006324555,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.821821822,0.768768769,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

923085,15,8,181,Committee on Finance. - Vote 27—Agriculture (Resumed).,25/04/1956,Mr. Denis Allen,Fianna Fáil,Wexford,"I am putting on record what has been said to me a thousand and one times by farmers and producers. They have no confidence whatever that the Minister for Agriculture or the Department of Agriculture are capable of marketing more agricultural produce if it is made available, whether it is butter or any other product you can mention. That has been pointed out time and again and the sooner the Minister gets the majority of his 700 officers and applies them to the task of considering how better we can market increased agricultural production, the better it will be. Nothing worth while will be achieved until that is done, until the farmers and the producers are confident that it will be marketed and you will not have the Minister coming in here roaring and bawling, as he did two years ago, about all the wheat that was produced when Deputy Walsh was in office, saying that it was a bad news crop because the farmers grew in the year 1954 so many hundred thousand acres of wheat. It was a bad news crop for his colleagues, the Labour Party, and it was taken up by the organs of the Press supporting the Minister at the time that this must come to an end. It was the very same thing with pig production. Farmers were doing too well when Deputy Walsh was in office. There was too much profit in pigs at that time and the number of pigs was increasing at a great rate, as also was the number of sows. But within one six months, owing to the Minister's action in allowing his colleagues to increase the price of pig feeding by £6 a ton and to depress the price, by fixing bacon prices, which farmers or producers were getting, serious damage was done to that line of agricultural production. There is no doubt that towards the end of the year in which the Minister took office, 1954, because of the steep fall from June to [928] November in the price paid for pigs, pig feeders lost tens of thosuands of pounds. The Minister should have been informed and advised by his Department whose function it is to advise the Minister if any other Department of State does anything that is detrimental to the agricultural interest. There is a sum of £2,691,000 provided for the land reclamation scheme. A question was put down to the Minister recently to ask him if he would state in respect of 1955 the total acreage of land reclaimed under Sections A and B respectively of the land project. Section A is the part of the scheme that was introduced by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Agriculture in the early '30s to give grants for the reclamation of land. The same principle is still in operation although the grants may have been increased somewhat. Section B was introduced in order that some of the American Counterpart Fund might be spent by the Minister for Agriculture and under that portion of the scheme the Department of Agriculture undertake to get the work done.",25/04/1956,15,150,151,coming in here roaring and bawling as he did two years ago about all the wheat that was produced when,Deputy Walsh,was in office saying that it was a bad news crop because the farmers grew in the year 1954 so,Deputy Walsh,923085_1,,coming in here roaring and bawling as he did two years ago about all the wheat that was produced when Deputy Walsh was in office saying that it was a bad news crop because the farmers grew in the year 1954 so,coming in here roaring and bawling as he did two years ago about all the wheat that was produced when was in office saying that it was a bad news crop because the farmers grew in the year 1954 so,text654,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,-0.120096115,-0.003002403,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.188188188,0.214214214,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3864003,2207,9,131,OECD Report on Public Service Reform: Statements.,20/05/2008,Mr. Kieran O'Donnell,Fine Gael,Limerick East,"The Minister for Finance’s speech is more of the same. The Government commissions expensive reports, such as this OECD public management review and while it is a good report, it merely states the obvious. Although the Minister has left the House, I note the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh. I wish to make some references to the contents of the Minister’s speech. He referred to what the Government has done in respect of increased integration of special needs education into mainstream education. What of the children with autism? The new OECD report refers to being citizen-centred. What about being child-centred? What of a child who has a special need to access in respect of applied behavioural analysis, ABA? No reference was made to it in the Minister’s speech. [766]I note the Minister for Finance had a get-out clause in respect of agencies. He stated he had put on record his dissatisfaction with the increase in Government bodies and agencies. I am sure this is the case because 200 such bodies have been established under the Government’s watch since 1997. A total of 1,000 such bodies exist, many of which are duplicating work. As for the economic outlook, the Minister took no responsibility for the fact that when proper public service reform was required, the Government did absolutely nothing. While there have been countless reports, they never have been acted upon. Although the OECD report is good, will the Government act on it? Moreover, the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, set up the task force for public sector reform. While I welcome the putting in place of its committee members, will its recommendations be acted upon? Will it come up with anything that is not already known? I refer to the squandering of money and the simple measures that should have been put in place. For instance, public sector bodies and agencies should have been told to set targets of cuts in administration costs of 2% or 3% per year, thereby perhaps enabling the savings to go to frontline services. As for output statements, as a new Deputy and an accountant, they provide little value. In the main they are narrative in form and must be reconsidered. They should be framed in language that will enable Members to engage in proper scrutiny. I refer to looking after those who are less well off. Since 2002, Government-regulated services have contributed 45% of the rate of inflation. Furthermore, the poor and vulnerable are affected by high rates of inflation in many respects and the Government has done little in this regard. No proper planning took place in respect of e-Government and the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report on the subject was damning. I note the Minister for Finance referred to the public service broker project. However, he completely neglected to mention that €35 million has been wasted on that project to date. Although he was discussing the Government’s actions, he failed to mention the ill-functioning nature of the project. Furthermore, the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report on e-Government stated that no plan was in place for 2007. While a plan existed for 2005 and 2006, proper planning was absent. In this regard, I was present at the final appearance of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, before the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service. He admitted, on reflection, that the single area on which the Government was accountable pertained to the proper planning of e-projects and various projects. The Government obliged officials to perform their day jobs as well as trying to manage sophisticated projects. Specific teams, perhaps from several Departments, should have been looking after this area and the Government stands indicted in this regard. I revert to the OECD report itself. It speaks about two main issues, namely, an integrated public service and citizen-focused services from the public service. In layman’s terms, 'integrated' means there is duplication of effort between Departments and agencies. Furthermore, an element of turf warfare probably is taking place between various agencies and this will come down to the individuals concerned. The phrase, 'citizen-focused services', simply means that those who ring a Department will not be left waiting for 20 minutes to get through and will not be pushed from one person to another. While many public servants do a terrific job, the consistency of service I seek is absent. That is a key point because one may phone the public service and receive an excellent service from one individual but speak to a different person when one calls again. This relates to management and putting systems in place. Reference was made to Ireland’s considerable demographic changes in recent years. Nearly 15% of Ireland’s population is foreign-born. These people are very welcome, but that brings [767]its own challenges. With our ageing population, the dependency ratio is increasing rapidly, which also presents challenges. The report makes specific reference to proper planning for schools, which is important. That has not happened to date. In many urban settings houses are built and there are many young children, but no space is left to build schools. Some local authorities are good in this regard and others are not, but consistency is needed. Regarding Government agencies, the report uses the word 'agencification', which relates to the proliferation of agencies. The report states that the Government uses agencies to increase the number of people working in the public sector via a back door system. The report is critical of this practice because it has lead to a lack of accountability and increased fragmentation. My final point relates to decentralisation and it will be of interest to the new Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Martin Mansergh. Decentralisation, which is now called administrative relocation, was not properly planned and if it is not properly implemented now it may lead to further fragmentation. I welcome the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General has seen fit to conduct a report on this matter. The Government stands indicted. The Minister for Finance of the time, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, announced decentralisation to some fanfare on 3 December 2003. He said over 10,000 jobs would be decentralised by the end of 2006 and that if this was not achieved heads should roll. I have not seen heads roll yet. Will that happen? Only 2,700 jobs have been decentralised so far and only 120 people were decentralised in 2008. Only 50% of these people came from Dublin. What will the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, do on this issue? Will there be decentralisation and what changes will be introduced?",20/05/2008,30,56,58,the Minister has left the House I note the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance,Deputy Martin Mansergh,I wish to make some references to the contents of the Minister's speech He referred to what the Government has,Deputy Martin Mansergh,3864003_2,,the Minister has left the House I note the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance Deputy Martin Mansergh I wish to make some references to the contents of the Minister's speech He referred to what the Government has,the Minister has left the House I note the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance I wish to make some references to the contents of the Minister's speech He referred to what the Government has,text633,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.292510684,-0.007312767,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.066066066,0.099099099,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1232801,894,9,93,Committee on Finance. - Vote 48—Health (Resumed).,02/03/1966,Mr. Michael Joseph O'Higgins,Fine Gael,Dublin South-West,"It has been a long and hard struggle to get a Fianna Fáil Minister for Health to consider objectively the manner in which our health services should be reorganised. I have always felt it is desirable in relation to any consideration of our health services that we should not be inhibited by the present accepted divisions of the population into particular income groups or by the present system under which these groups are provided for. What I have advocated for a long time is that at some stage there should [807] be an objective consideration by the Government or the Dáil of what kind of health services we should have without regard to what is there at present. It was to that end and with that object in mind that some 18 months ago, on behalf of my Party, I submitted to the Select Committee on Health Services a detailed memorandum setting out the case for the provision of a general medical service, a service based on our requirements in the present age. In that memorandum, which has never seen the light of day, which has never been circulated to Deputies, there is contained a case for a new approach to reorganisation of our health services. It also contains a plan under which a comprehensive medical service can be provided for the entire population. We seem to forget—and I think this is one of the greatest weaknesses of the White Paper—that we are so far behind all countries in western Europe that even these proposals represent a form of health services which is out of date by some 25 or 30 years. At present, apart from Finland, Ireland is the only country in western Europe which makes no provision for the general body of wage-earners and persons of limited means in regard to a general medical service. Apart from Finland, we are the only country that insists in our health policy that the average person must, in regard to the provision of medical care, fend for himself. When I say 'we' I mean we who live in this part of Ireland because it is worth recalling, as we frequently forget, that our people who live in Northern Ireland have available to them a general medical service as they do in Britain, in France, in Belgium and all the countries on the continent of Europe. What are we doing here? This Dáil is discussing a very limited and belated approach to the reorganisation of health services which is based on the policy contained in the Health Act, 1953, which has demonstrably failed. This White Paper now proposes a palliative, a bit of papering over of cracks [808] in the 1953 Health Act policy. Where are we going? We are supposed some day to look forward to the reunion of our country: more immediately we are supposed to look forward to the day which, we are told will be no more distant than 1970, when we shall enter Europe. Do we seriously contemplate that the services set out in this White Paper will represent the high-water mark of the manner in which we are going to provide for our people within the European Community? If that is what we contemplate, there must be a great deal of fresh thinking on health services. If we go into Europe in 1968, 1969 or 1970, and even if the proposals in the White Paper are implemented, we shall not measure up we shall be going in as a limping relative with a system of health services far below what any other country in the European Community regards as a minimum. It is for that reason that I want to remind the House, as has been done already by Deputy Fitzpatrick and others, that while we are discussing here proposals which we welcome and which we do not want to be in any way ungrateful for, it would be very wrong for any Deputy to think that this little step forward can in any circumstances be regarded as facing up to the problem of health services here. I regret to say that in the entire White Paper there is still perfectly evident the old public charity approach to health policy. There is still the division of people into groups, into the haves and the have nots. There is still the idea that you must make regulations and provide safeguards lest people might get something more than what, on an exact and just means examination, they are entitled to. That kind of approach to the provision of health services is old hat, it is out of date, and I regret that a new Minister for Health, doing his best I have no doubt, should have been sold the idea that in modern Ireland that is the way to face up to health policy. What are we doing here? We are abolishing the dispensary system and this is claimed to be a tremendous new step. We are hoping to provide a [809] measure of assistance for the middle-income group in respect of drugs and medicines. We are hoping to provide an extension of the district nursing system for persons in the middle-income group and for the chronically sick and for old people. We are hoping to provide an extension of dental, aural and ophthalmic services to additional groups of people. These are the four provisions in the White Paper— abolishing the dispensary system, helping the average family in the middle-income group in respect of drugs and medicines, providing nursing services for the old and chronically sick in the home, and providing dental, aural and ophthalmic services. I should like Deputies to take stock of what we are proposing to do. This is 1966 and in 1957 as Minister for Health, I announced a decision to alter the dispensary system, to modify it in order to provide for poor people a choice of doctor. That was nine years ago. I announced it just prior to the general election of 1957. I was not in a position to implement that decision because of a change of Government. Following the change of Government, I, on behalf of my Party, persisted in the idea and I tried to encourage the new Minister for Health, my successor, to accept that the choice of doctor, even while retaining a form of general medical service confined to poor people, was essential. I made many speeches in this House I spoke many times throughout the country to try to get that small penny to drop. I might as well have been out in the middle of a field baying like a lunatic for all the impression I made. It availed nothing. Through 1957, 1958 and 1959, right into the 1960s, anything that I said or Deputies in my Party or in the Labour Party said, fell on deaf ears. It was impossible to convince the Minister for Health that a small limited change of that kind to provide for poor people a choice of doctor could be made. In fact, may I remind Deputies that in pursuance of my idea at the time, and which is largely accepted now, I proposed that a number of the temporary district medical officer appointments in this city should not be filled and that instead [810] a pilot scheme providing for a choice of doctor should be embarked upon in Dublin city? My successor, Deputy MacEntee, rejecting that idea proceeded to fill all these dispensary posts permanently. Indeed, as Deputies will recall, that led to considerable difficulty in certain parts of this city. The decision to fill the posts was a decision to reject a very modest decision which I had announced as Minister for Health and the proposal which I had made that an effort should be made, even within the policy of confining a general medical service to poor people, to provide a choice of doctor. In relation to these matters, while towards the end of the 1950s the thinking in my Party was merely along the lines of providing a choice of doctor within the general medical service, we proceeded then in our thinking to go further and by 1960 and 1961 so far as the Fine Gael Party were concerned, we began to realise that providing a choice of doctor and abolishing the dispensary system were only temporising with the problem of reorganising the health services. We carried out some thinking in depth and we came to the conclusion some years ago that if we were to keep abreast of other countries, we had to contemplate, to the extent possible within our resources, the provision of comprehensive services, services which would be available to the bulk of the population, which would provide not merely a general practitioner service but also ancillary services, a hospital service, nursing service and so on. It was as far back as 1961 that we detailed our policy of providing a comprehensive health service based on the principle of social insurance. I should like to recall to Deputies the fact that in the autumn of 1961 we incorporated our ideas in a Dáil motion. It was a motion in which we called for the introduction of a comprehensive health service based on social insurance. In the discussion on that motion, on behalf of my Party I gave to Dáil Éireann the details of our thinking in that regard. That was five years ago. Our motion was answered by the Government in an amendment tabled by them which sought to refuse the terms [811] of our motion and proposed the setting up of a Select Committee. That is how the Select Committee on Health Services came into being. It was the Government's answer to our proposal, to set up a Committee to discuss the whole matter. I do not want to make any criticism of the manner in which that Select Committee functioned. I hope that some day, and I believe the sooner the better, the Dáil will order the minutes of that Committee to be published. If they are published, Deputies and the country will see the frustrating experience that Deputies serving on that Committee who were interested in the reorganisation of our health services had to experience. I, and the other Deputies of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, served long hours on that Select Committee, trying, day after day, to convince the representatives of the Government on that Committee that a change was possible, that it could be brought about, that its bringing about as a result of our common deliberations would achieve what we all desired, the removal of health and health policy from Party politics. There was not one Deputy who seriously worked on that Committee who, at the end, was not convinced that its purpose was merely to prevent discussion of our health policy. It was in sheer desperation that in the dying days of that Committee, I was charged by my Party to prepare a memorandum setting out in detail what the Fine Gael Party stood for. I hope that some day this memorandum will be published so that the public and Deputies may see the depth and, I believe, the probity, of our thinking on this matter. It is when one recalls these events that one experiences some surprise at the naïve statement contained in paragraph 53 of this White Paper where it is stated that the Government are aware of proposals recently made for the extension to the whole community of the general practitioner service, with free choice of doctor. I wonder how long it is necessary to keep on speaking [812] before someone listens to what you are saying. The White Paper was published in 1966 and it refers to the Government being aware of proposals recently made. As far back as 1961, my Party moved Dáil Éireann to approve of the idea of a comprehensive medical service available to the entire community. In the years subsequent to that, we pursued that idea, endeavouring to convince the Government that it was necessary in the interests of the nation and possible with our resources. If paragraph 53 of the White Paper means anything, it means that the Government have only recently been made aware of all that we have been saying. It is a pity that this closed mind approach to this important matter of health services should still persist. In the White Paper we are now getting the first small step forward. We are abolishing the present dispensary system to the extent that we provide a choice of doctor. That represents for Fianna Fáil now the Fine Gael thinking of nine years ago. Apparently Fianna Fáil have now reached the stage we reached almost a decade ago. How much longer will it be before a Fianna Fáil Government, if still there, will recognise the necessity for a general medical service available to the entire population? I do not like to prophesy in this matter, but if our common hopes are achieved and if, next year or the year after, or the year after that, we find ourselves subscribing to the Treaty of Rome and entering the European Community, how quickly will it then be realised that a general comprehensive medical service is absolutely essential? If we do not do it within the European Community, we cannot possibly hope to survive. We have to have our health services and our general social legislation at least at the same level as already regarded as necessary amongst other European countries. It is not a very large step. One of the difficulties I know the Minister for Health has had to contend with in even announcing these limited steps in this White Paper has been the complete [813] rejection by his predecessor of all our proposals. He has made a limited step from that complete rejection by his predecessor but he has not been able to do much. One of the troubles has been the rejection by his predecessor and by the Taoiseach of our ideas for financing the health service. Fundamental to the idea of a comprehensive health service is social insurance. It is only when people realise that progress in social legislation and health services must be removed from payment by general taxation and local rates that proper progress can be made. That idea is fundamental to our policy. It was rejected out of hand by the Taoiseach and the previous Minister for Health and it is because it was rejected that these limited proposals are contained in the White Paper. We all know well that if we are to try to finance health services by general taxation, we will be up against problems that no Government can adequately deal with. If we are to try to do it by a wedding of general and local taxation, we will be up against a difference in standards. That is one of the troubles we have had in the health services under the 1953 Act. In some health authority areas, the indenting on local rates has been so hard that a lower standard is accepted because a health authority manager just cannot afford to increase the local rates bill. So since 1953 we have had different standards in different parts of the country because in some areas the ratepayers cannot afford to meet the added bill. In that respect, the Minister has announced that in so far as the cost of increases in health services are concerned, he will freeze the rates contribution. That is a slight step in the right direction, but it still leaves the problem which he is facing here and now that in so far as the cost of health services generally is concerned, it still has to be paid for by the general body of taxpayers, and so he can do nothing. These White Paper proposals are merely put forward now so that they may be discussed, and all our discussions here will not achieve anything unless in the end money is found to [814] implement them, and if money is found to implement them at the end of next year or the year after, whenever the green light is given, what will we achieve? We are to provide a choice of doctor for people who will be confined under regulations made by the Minister with the caution: As a wide extension of the operating of State organised medical services has not been demonstrated to be necessary, the Government would regard it as undersiable. I would not therefore propose that the limits to be fixed by the regulations would be such as to include a high proporation of the population. That is a clear warning that even when the abolition of the present dispensary system comes about, it will still be confined to the section of the population who at the moment are roughly covered by medical cards. There still will be the means test approach, the parsimonious approach. Why? Because to do otherwise would be to make the burden on the taxpayer undesirably high. When this bill is footed by general taxation, when can one expect another step forward? The plain truth will be that there will again be the old struggle between the Minister for Finance, anxious to keep down costs, and the demands of the Department of Health and other Departments to increase the quality of the services, and whatever progress is made in the general quality of the health services will be won after a struggle between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance. That is axiomatic. It is bound to develop unless somebody, from today, begins to realise that the only logical way of providing against ill-health is by getting people intermittently, weekly, to pay while in good health for the cost of ill-health. It is one of the most fundamental concepts in relation to any way of beating health problems—the idea of a health insurance fund under which people in good health are asked to contribute the cost each week of ten cigarettes to cover the entire family. It is only in that way that we can provide a general standard and that [815] we can ensure that standards can be kept in touch with those obtaining in other countries. It is because there is not an acceptance of the principle of social insurance that this White Paper and the policy it contains is so limited, so confined. On this side of the House, we believe that in so far as our general health policy is concerned, the things we advocated in aiming at a just society are still valid. We believe that the ideals contained in that policy document are still sound, and while we must and do generously accept what is proposed here, it is very far short of what I believe is required. It is indicative of the whole approach to this problem that in the White Paper no effort is proposed to provide hospital services. There should be free hospital services for ordinary people of limited means in this country and I fail to understand the mentality behind a policy which says that a workman who goes to hospital should be compelled, while sick and unable to earn, to meet hospital bills. That is an approach Victorian in concept that should have no place in modern thinking. We should have a system whereby every working man will be encouraged to stand on his own feet, encouraged to provide by insurance against the day when he becomes ill so that when he is ill and perhaps unable to earn, he will not have the added anxiety of hospital bills mounting up against him. This absurd system is to continue under the White Paper. The only move in the right direction is to remove the absurd specialist charges introduced by Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Health in 1957. It was a wrong thing. The policy in this White Paper is merely building up on the Health Act policy and that policy, in my view, was wrong fundamentally. This is merely adding palliatives to try to deal with fringe cases, to try to paper over the cracks and make the health services something they cannot be. There is still the means test approach, the failure to stand back and examine the whole problem objectively. I do not want to go into any greater detail on these matters. My views and those of [816] my Party are well known. I should like to add just one or two other things. There is a proposal here that, while retaining a general medical service for people who establish the need on means test and in accordance with regulations, there would be some provision in aid given to persons who do not qualify under the regulations, and who are in the middle income group, in respect of drugs and medicines. Again, may I say that this is obviously an effort to meet the large volume of evidence adduced to the Health Services Committee which established beyond doubt—to my mind, at least— that the cost of drugs and medicines when sickness strikes in the home to the average family was crippling? I am going to prophesy that, if the Minister introduces a scheme whereby aid in respect of drugs and medicines will be given, if the expenditure exceeds a certain sum, he will find that just will not work. Once he introduces this, he might as well accept the necessity for some scheme of general application to help people in regard to drugs and medicines. Our proposal in that regard, contained in the memorandum submitted to the Select Committee, involved the recognition that drugs and medicines should be available freely to all sections, outside those who are unemployed, sick or in receipt of social assistance, with the insurance fund paying half the cost. I believe the Minister for Health, whoever the will be, will sooner or later be forced to accept that necessity. Once you start providing that expenditure over a certain sum will be aided by health authorities, you are opening the door, and you might as well stand back and accept the necessity for new thinking with regard to this. The White Paper also proposes the extension of the district nursing services. That again is something I welcome. We have advocated it for a long time and it is part of our policy. The fourth provision here is the extension of dental, aural and ophthalmic services to additional groups of people. I was sorry to read that in the White Paper. It is not an objective or realistic [817] approach. As Deputy O'Connell pointed out, it would be much fairer to admit that these services are not there at the moment for any group of people, not to mind additional groups. Do Deputies realise that under section 21 of the 1953 Health Act it was solemnly legislated that these services should be provided in accordance with regulations not only for the lower-income group but for the middle-income group, the bulk of the population? That was provided by a section in an Act of Parliament 13 years ago. These services never went into operation. They were never provided. Indeed, when I became Minister for Health, after I had entered into a solemn commitment to Deputies that I would implement the Health Act services—although I disagreed with the fundamental policy of it—I had a costing in relation to the provision of dental services and the other services in accordance with section 21. I found at that stage that under the manner in which the section laid it down, the cost was absolutely prohibitive. That was away back in 1954. Having learned that, I went to every local authority in this country. I concealed nothing. I told each health authority these services could not be provided and that the very best I could hope to do was to ensure that a beginning would be made in building up a proper school dental service but beyond that, except in the case of absolute medical urgency in respect of bad teeth, nothing but a very limited public dental service could be provided. My views as then stated have been repeated over the years. The dental, aural and ophthalmic services are no more than rudimentary. It is not because we have a shortage of dentists. We have plenty of them. There is no trouble in getting dentists, provided we pay them. Of course, it will not be possible to provide dental, aural or ophthalmic services of a specialist nature out of taxation. It just cannot be done and it is much more honest to admit it cannot be done. The only way any such service can be provided is under a scheme financed by weekly contributions. If that is accepted, then [818] a great deal is possible. If that is not accepted, very little can be done. We see here the extent of the thinking of a new Minister in regard to what is possible. Once a health policy continues to envisage the taxpayer paying by yearly injections the cost of health services, there is going to be a barrier all the time. Therefore, I feel considerable regret that there should be a promise of the extension of non-existing dental, aural and ophthalmic services. They are not there at the moment. It would have been far better if the White Paper merely contained an assurance that an effort would be made to provide these services for poor people. If we started by doing that, we might be doing something worthwhile. I hope anything I have said will not be regarded as being in any way unduly critical of any person involved in the definition of health policy here. I do not intend it in that way, but I am very concerned about the continuance of a policy which I regard as unsound. Sooner or later we will have to stand back and have regard to the resources of the country and the best way of planning the service we should like to see here. We can do a great deal by community effort. We can do a great deal by having regard to the ordinary sentiments and habits of our people. I do not believe that anyone would object to paying a weekly sum in order to make provision for ill-health. When I introduced the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill in 1956, I was told by some doubters that it would not succeed and that it would, in fact, require heavy subsidisation from the State. I believed in the idea of insurance. I believed in the fundamental good sense and decency of the ordinary people. I believed it would be possible, if the State gave the lead, to encourage people to provide against ill-health. I made a statement at the time which was regarded as being ill-advised I said that the idea of voluntary health insurance would be the first social welfare scheme in western Europe that would not cost the taxpayer a penny. I am proud to recall that the hope I expressed then has been fully borne out. Innately the average father, or head of a family, likes to feel that by saving [819] a little or by not spending a little each week or each month, he will be able to put aside, with other neighbours in a sort of community effort, something that will help somebody when ill-health strikes. That is the justification for social insurance. I believe it is the only way in which we will get a proper extension of health services and the kind of health services that will enable us to look forward to the reunion of this country without misgivings and to entering into Europe also without misgivings. If we do not to that, we shall always, have a problem. In conclusion, the Minister and the Government have thought it necessary to have this White Paper debated here. I can understand the desirability of having a general discussion on health policy, but, after this debate, I sincerely hope it will not be found necessary to delay the implementation of these modified and limited proposals. Any step forward is worthwhile any breakthrough is welcome. If we can get away from the monolithic approach to health policy, the approach we have experienced over the last decade almost, that will be a good thing. I should like to see these proposals implemented as quickly as possible after this debate. I look forward, as I have always looked forward, to the day when we will have an end to controversy on health. Health policy has bedevilled our circumstances here for far too long. There have been outrageous charges and countercharges. It is about time we realised we are a very small country with a problem which is limited in its nature if we only have the faith and determination to solve it, we will make progress, and make it rapidly.",02/03/1966,18,2114,2115,provide a choice of doctor That represents for Fianna Fáil now the Fine Gael thinking of nine years ago Apparently,Fianna Fáil,have now reached the stage we reached almost a decade ago How much longer will it be before a Fianna,Fianna Fáil,1232801_8,,provide a choice of doctor That represents for Fianna Fáil now the Fine Gael thinking of nine years ago Apparently Fianna Fáil have now reached the stage we reached almost a decade ago How much longer will it be before a Fianna,provide a choice of doctor That represents for Fianna Fáil now the Fine Gael thinking of nine years ago Apparently have now reached the stage we reached almost a decade ago How much longer will it be before a Fianna,text617,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.226451955,0.005661299,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.795795796,0.738738739,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3684012,985,14,92,Private Members&rsquo Business - Waste Management: Motion (Resumed).,21/06/2006,Mr. Ruairí Quinn,The Labour Party,Dublin South-East,"I wish to share time with Deputy Gilmore. It is the stated policy of the elected members of Dublin City Council, as set out in the Dublin City Development Plan 2005-2011, to oppose the siting of an incinerator on the Poolbeg Peninsula, while it is the stated policy of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to build an incinerator on the peninsula, despite what their representatives and candidates in the local area may claim. The Government parties solved this problem by removing all relevant powers from the elected representatives of the people on Dublin City Council and vesting them in civil servants instead. Ministerial diktat runs the waste policy of Dublin city. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government claimed last night in the House and on RTE radio earlier, that CHP will be undertaken in Poolbeg. He asserted there would not be incineration and certainly not a mass burn incinerator. What, a normal member of the community not fluent in the jargon of waste management might ask, does CHP mean? CHP stands for combined heat and power. CHP means a mass burn incinerator that extracts both electricity and heat from the incineration process. Does that sound familiar? Is that supposed to be okay? As Shakespeare, the Bard, might have said today: 'That which we call an incinerator by any other name would smell as foul'. Officials of Dublin City Council still call this an incinerator. They are not under the cosh of the Progressive Democrats and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and his Fianna Fáil colleagues are using the language of public relations. Next, he will tell Members that it is not a tax hike, it is a revenue enhancement. I take this opportunity to thank the Green Party for tabling this motion and for giving the many Opposition Members of this House who have been vocal on the matter a chance to voice their opinions. Several Government Members will also be keen to make statements. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, expressed his personal preference many times that no incinerator be located in Wicklow. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who is not in the House and presumably will not enter the Chamber this evening, has given similar promises regarding the proposed Poolbeg incinerator, including, as Deputy Gormley noted yesterday, in his election literature. Indeed, the Minister recently issued a leaflet entitled, Michael McDowell is opposed to Dublin City Council’s mass burn incinerator at Poolbeg. [151]Therefore, if he has the courage of his convictions, I look forward to seeing him cross the floor this evening to vote in accordance with the documentation with which he has flooded the constituency of Dublin South-East. At the outset, I wish to declare an interest. I represent the constituency of Dublin South-East and I live less than 500 m from the proposed location of the incinerator. There are valid and logical reasons to oppose the siting of an incinerator at Poolbeg and yesterday’s contributions covered many of them. I will draw attention to some specific aspects which I believe are important, as well as introducing some new information to the record. The choice of Poolbeg is the first in a series of bizarre and illogical decisions made by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Poolbeg is at the heart of one of the city’s most valuable assets, namely, Dublin Bay. The bay is not simply an economic asset in terms of the passenger and freight shipping facilities it provides. It is also a major recreational facility for those living in the city. The proposed S2S, or Sutton to Sandycove promenade, will greatly improve this facility. This is the most populated bay on the island. Hence, it is bizarre to introduce an enormous industrial plant dedicated to burning waste of all types in the middle of the most scenic part of the city. While the Poolbeg peninsula has long been left idle, the opportunity now presents itself to use it for the benefit of all citizens. The Progressive Democrats have pointed this out in wonderfully graphic literature. They have flooded the constituency with a Sydney, Australia-like image of what that part of the bay could look like. Tonight however, as Deputy Fiona O’Malley informed the House, they will vote for the destruction of that possibility by putting an incinerator at its heart. It would be remiss of me not to mention my colleagues, Councillors Kevin Humphries and Dermot Lacey, who are four-square behind me and the Labour group on Dublin City Council in respect of this issue. According to figures released by Dublin City Council officials, 600,000 tonnes of waste will be required to fuel the incinerator each year. This amounts to 1,644 tonnes per day. City officials already accept that at least 140 20-tonne trucks will be obliged to travel through the area each day, as well as an unidentified number, possibly as high as 240, according to the assistant city manager, of smaller bin lorries. More trucks will be required to transport the bottom ash, that is, the residue left over from incineration, back out of the incinerator plant, adding at least 30% to the volume of truck movements. This is in addition to the already chronic traffic problem afflicting the area, with significant volumes of traffic passing along Strand Road, as well [152]as trucks travelling to and from the port and local building sites. The officials claim that some of the trucks will use the port tunnel. Even if this is the case — they admit that at most, less than half will use the tunnel — the effect on the area will be enormous. There will be dust, dirt, smells and traffic jams. While my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, is more than capable of expanding on this issue, I suggest that incineration in its present form is now an outdated technology. Many European countries have stopped building new incinerator plants to deal with waste and are concentrating on combined mechanical and biological treatments and large-scale recycling. Historically, recycling in this country has been neglected and recycling on any significant scale has only taken place in recent years. However, there is a serious problem with the Government’s basic approach to recycling. For example, no present scheme makes it financially worthwhile for a commercial company to recycle extensively. Companies do not engage in waste reduction in a broad sense because of the associated opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of not recycling or reducing must be increased greatly. If companies found it more economical to recycle than to simply feed waste into the system, one can be sure that every company in the state would so do. Why can rational market forces not be harnessed to achieve an outcome desired by all, instead of ignoring the market and extolling the motivation of companies while allowing them to dump their waste, which is in effect what is happening? The Labour Party believes it is time for the Government to properly incentivise recycling across the entire spectrum of society, not simply among domestic households. Our existing landfill systems also leave much to be desired. The days of the dump are long gone. Other European countries intensively manage their landfills and we must do the same. I will leave the more detailed examination of incineration and the other available options to my colleague, Deputy Gilmore. The particular project that has been mentioned in this motion, namely, the proposed incinerator at Poolbeg, is not quite as cut and dried as it may seem. There are anomalies in the claims made by officials in the tendering and procurement processes and in the manner in which the entire plan has been pushed through from the outset. Mr. Joe McCarthy, a name which makes officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government quake in their boots as he was one of those who exposed the e-voting machines scandal, recently produced a report on the process, based on what little information he could extract from the Minister and his officials. It is recommended reading for anyone interested in how not to manage a large-scale infrastructural project. [153]I wish to address several specific aspects of the project that serve as exemplars of how badly managed it has been thus far. The Waste Management (Planning) Regulations 1997 require a waste management plan to include systems to monitor 'before, during and after' any changes made by the plan. Chapter 11. 3.2. of the waste management plan agreed by the elected members of Dublin City Council requires city officials to record such statistics. However, they will not make such information available to the public and it appears they do not have the information. Starting a project without knowing one’s starting point is not simply foolish, it is negligent. The technical model used to rationalise the decision to build an incinerator at Poolbeg was valid for the period from 1997 to 2011. Only five years remain until the end of this model’s lifespan and I find it extremely unlikely that any incinerator will be built and functioning within that timeframe. Therefore, we will be building for a future which we have not even tried to envisage. Again, this is not simply foolish, it is also negligent. The cost model assumptions involved in the economic rationale for the incinerator are equally outdated. For example, while the interest rates used in the model for the process of construction were calculated at 6. 5%, the current European Central Bank rate is 3. 75%. The original plan costed the plant at €146 million and the technical model uses the same cost. The siting report, used to determine the premium location, uses a cost of €127 million, while the Forfás review of 2001 refers to a cost of €160 million. However, Mazars Consultants, which provides costings estimates for large-scale projects, estimates that an incinerator of smaller capacity than that proposed in Dublin would cost €200 million. Must I mention the Dublin Port tunnel to provide the House with a litany of miscalculations in respect of costs?",21/06/2006,29,412,413,Poolbeg incinerator including as Deputy Gormley noted yesterday in his election literature Indeed the Minister recently issued a leaflet entitled,Michael McDowell,is opposed to Dublin City Council's mass burn incinerator at Poolbeg 151 Therefore if he has the courage of his,Michael McDowell,3684012_11,,Poolbeg incinerator including as Deputy Gormley noted yesterday in his election literature Indeed the Minister recently issued a leaflet entitled Michael McDowell is opposed to Dublin City Council's mass burn incinerator at Poolbeg 151 Therefore if he has the courage of his,Poolbeg incinerator including as Deputy Gormley noted yesterday in his election literature Indeed the Minister recently issued a leaflet entitled is opposed to Dublin City Council's mass burn incinerator at Poolbeg 151 Therefore if he has the courage of his,text124,2,1,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-0.510825624,-0.012770641,0.080064077,0.002001602,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.186186186,0.199199199,0.538538539,0.520520521,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1692930,828,9,92,"Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Bill, 1975: Second Stage.",14/05/1975,Mr. Fergus O'Brien,Fine Gael,Dublin South-East,"Deputy Andrews was allowed stray somewhat. He spoke of people not wishing to be out of work and said they objected to taking alms. This highlights the thinking of the Opposition in regard to social welfare. They regard social welfare benefits as handouts, but they never spared the people's money where vote-buying [1801] was concerned. They used social welfare in their budgets as a votecatching effort. If there was an election in the offing, old age pensioners were given an increase but these increases were very small, especially when compared with this Government's attitude to the whole area of social welfare. I do not know why the Opposition are creating such a fuss about this Bill. The extension of the scheme will not involve any additional increase in contributions. The £1. 8 million is available. The scheme is working well and the logical way to progress in relation to it was to extend the period of unemployment. Nobody will refute the figures for unemployment, but we have always had our unemployed. At least, though, people are staying in the country now, whereas during the terms of office of Fianna Fáil the emigrant ships were nearly always full and this situation kept the unemployment figures down. If people are out of work now they are assured of reasonable incomes by way of social welfare payments. This is part of the social reform programme to which this Government are committed. We introduced the deserted wives' allowance, allowance for the dependants of long-term prisoners and an allowance for single women. All of this is an indication of the Government's concern for the less-well off. There have been complaints of abuse of the pay-related benefit scheme, but there is no scheme that is not subjected to abuse by some people. However, because of a small element of abuse it would not be justifiable to write off an entire scheme. The answer would appear to lie in educating people to respect social welfare legislation. Regarding the building industry, a gentleman who is outside this House is often quoted on the problems of that industry. Since this Government took office, the gentleman in question has been continuously pointing to these problems. He might be regarded as being a very effective spokesman for Fianna Fáil rather than for the building industry.",14/05/1975,20,189,190,had our unemployed At least though people are staying in the country now whereas during the terms of office of,Fianna Fáil,the emigrant ships were nearly always full and this situation kept the unemployment figures down If people are out of,Fianna Fáil,1692930_2,,had our unemployed At least though people are staying in the country now whereas during the terms of office of Fianna Fáil the emigrant ships were nearly always full and this situation kept the unemployment figures down If people are out of,had our unemployed At least though people are staying in the country now whereas during the terms of office of the emigrant ships were nearly always full and this situation kept the unemployment figures down If people are out of,text23,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.118585412,-0.002964635,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.19019019,0.216216216,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2343020,1113,8,63,"Private Members' Business. - Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987: Second Stage.",02/02/1988,Dr. Michael J. Woods,Fianna Fáil,Dublin (Clontarf),"As Deputies know, the Minister for Justice is engaged on very important business connected with the Anglo-Irish [893] Conference so I am speaking on his behalf at this stage. The Government support the principle of this Bill and are anxious to see it proceed through Second Stage to be dealt thereafter in special committee. The Bill deals with matters which as Deputy Shatter has said, have been the subject of reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and of the Law Reform Commission. The commission discussed and considered the relative merits of certain approaches and their final views are expressed in the large number of recommendations for changes in the law of separation, or divorce a mensa et thoro as it is called at present, contained in their report. In their deliberations the joint committee took account of the Law Reform Commission's report, but did not follow it in full. In 1986 the previous Government stated their intention to implement changes in the law of separation taking into account those two reports. Deputy Shatter's initiative in having the Bill published is to be commended and welcomed. I welcome the sentiments Deputy Shatter expressed towards the end of his speech. I recognise the constructive part which an Opposition can play and the detailed work which has gone into the Bill. I also recognise that Deputy Shatter was big enough to say that the Government have done the right thing. I will not refer to the last period in Government but we have reached a stage where, especially through committees and the work of the Opposition, we can have proposals discussed objectively here on the floor of the House. I indicated previously to the House that my own proposals for changes in the law on separation were at an advanced stage of preparation and I have looked at the Bill in the light of those proposals. There are a number of matters in the Bill which are of concern to me and which may require amendment. I am in the process of ascertaining the views of interested Departments and of my colleagues in Government about these and other amendments which I think should [894] be made to the Bill. These other amendments I refer to are extensive and are designed to improve the Bill. However, in my speech I intend to concentrate on the main matters of concern to me and to indicate the kind of amendments I have in mind to deal with that concern. The Bill is important because of the extended remedies it proposes, namely, extension of the grounds for a decree of judicial separation, and the new maintenance, lump sums, secured payments and property orders provisions. The present remedy, divorce a mensa et thoro, has limited application because the grounds on which a decree is available are confined to adultery, cruelty and unnatural practices. Alimony is available only to the wife. Where, however, there is failure to maintain, the provisions of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, can be availed of by either spouse. However, most separating couples resort instead to comprehensive deeds of separation. That practice would of course continue to be the most appropriate procedure even after the enactment of this Bill — since it is generally better for couples with problems to come to mutually satisfactory solutions rather than to involve the courts — but undoubtedly there are cases in which both spouses, because of their differences, cannot agree to the terms of separation and may ultimately need to resort to the courts. In these cases it is important that the courts should have wider powers to grant a decree and to make ancillary orders, of the kind dealt with by Deputy Shatter in this Bill. The limited value of divorce a mensa et thoro decrees at present is reflected in the small number of applications to the courts. In 1986, 189 applications were made, 183 of which were made in the Circuit Court and the remaining six in the High Court. All the reports I have mentioned, as well as the Bill, recommend that the grounds for a decree of judicial separation should be extended. The approach in the Bill is that irretrievable breakdown should be the sole ground after proof of various matters such as [895] adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion and separation. I have reservations concerning irretrievable breakdown being the sole ground on which a decree of judicial separation should be granted, despite the fact that a similar recommendation was made by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. My first objection is a conceptual one. Judicial separation does not put an end to the marriage — the parties remain free to come together again and have the decree discharged. Irretrievable breakdown, if the phrase means anything, does not therefore appear to be an appropriate concept to use in the context of judicial separation. Another objection is that irretrievable breakdown of the marriage does not require to be proved before a decree of divorce a mensa et thoro can be granted under present law. Such a decree can be obtained on proof, simply, of, say, adultery or cruelty without anything further. If proof of irretrievable breakdown were to be insisted on as well, the result could be that decrees might not be available in circumstances where they could be obtained under present law. Of course, it could be argued against this point that it would probably be that once one of the other facts were proved, acceptance by the court that the marriage was, in fact, broken down irretrievably would, in practice, become a formality — as it has become in England, in relation to divorce, where there is a similar requirement to prove breakdown in addition to one or more other facts (such as adultery or separation). On this view, however, the addition of a requirement to prove breakdown, in addition, to, say, adultery serves no useful purpose and is, in fact, unnecessary. One of the main reasons for the proposal in the Bill seems to be the claim that 'breakdown' as the ground for a decree removes the need to investigate questions of fault. On any view, this claim does not hold water since the court would expressly be required, before granting a decree, to make a finding on one or more other facts, three of which adultery, [896] desertion and unreasonable behaviour, clearly involve fault. I am inclined to the view that it might be preferable to follow more closely the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this matter. Broadly, their recommendation would mean that one or more of the facts set out as (a) to (e) of section 2 of the Bill would be sufficient ground for granting a decree, namely, adultery, desertion, unreasonable behaviour, separation for one year where there is consent and separation for three years. The Programme for National Recovery had a similar proposal as, indeed, did the previous Government's Statement of Intentions. The ground at section 2 (f) in the Bill namely, that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live apart from the other spouse, is so wide as to be almost meaningless and I do not think that it should be retained. The Bill proposes, in effect, in sections 14 and 27 that desertion will no longer prevent people from getting maintenance or statutory succession rights. In relation to maintenance, the Bill contains the general provision that the conduct of parties shall affect maintenance awards where that conduct is 'repugnant'. While I acknowledge that these provisions are in line with proposals made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, it would seem to me that there should be strong convincing reasons before we make such a fundamental change in the law which would allow a spouse who repudiates the marriage by deserting to benefit from the resulting breakdown of the marriage. I am not aware that such convincing reasons have been advanced for the change recommended. My present view is that I would prefer to see a provision that is in line with existing family law provisions, providing that desertion should be an absolute bar to an application by a spouse for maintenance, or for any financial or property order under the Bill and, apart from that, that the conduct of each spouse would be a matter to be considered by the court in deciding whether to make such an order, where that conduct was such that in the [897] opinion of the court it would be inequitable to disregard it. I might mention that the position under existing law is that if a spouse obtains a decree of divorce a mensa et thoro on account of his wife's adultery, no alimony is payable to the wife. On the question of succession rights, the Bill provides in section 30 that, following a transitional period, a spouse who is in desertion for two years or more would no longer be precluded from succeeding to the estate of a deceased spouse. It would appear that the basis for the provision is the supposition that in all cases of desertion a decree of judicial separation will be applied for. I think there can be no basis for such a supposition. Apart from the effects on succession of a decree of judicial separation which I will deal with now, I can see no grounds for a change in the present position on desertion as a bar to statutory rights of succession. The Bill in sections 10 (1) (g) and 12, following generally the recommendation of the joint committee, proposes that, on the granting of a decree for judicial separation, the court should have the power to vary or discharge rights of succession of a spouse but only if, at the same time, it also makes a lump sum, property transfer, or settlement order in favour of that spouse, save where that spouse has been guilty of gross matrimonial misconduct. My main worry with this is that where under the proposal a court declined to make a lump sum, property or settlement order for the benefit of a dependent spouse in favour of allowing that spouse to keep his or her succession rights to the other spouse's estate, the latter may subsequently dissipate his or her assets, leaving no estate against which such dependent spouse can claim. This danger would exist also where under the proposal a court varied succession rights. The objection might also be made that giving the court discretion to vary succession rights offends against the long standing policy which favours certainty in the law of succession. The approach of the Law Reform Commission that on the granting of a [898] decree of judicial separation each spouse would be precluded from taking any share in the other's estate might be preferable. It is, of course, a common condition in the standard form of separation agreement used by separated persons that they each give up succession rights to the estate of the other. If the course recommended by the Law Reform Commission were adopted, loss of succession rights would have to be one of the matters the court would have regard to when exercising its powers to make a financial provision order. In this way, a dependent spouse would be as fully protected as possible. The question of succession rights following the granting of a decree of judicial separation certainly raises difficulties and it is one on which I would like to have the views of my colleagues in Government before Committee Stage. The Bill, while it provides for the court to seek reports on children, does not expressly provide that the court, before granting a decree must be satisfied that the arrangements made for each child are adequate and reasonable in the circumstances. I would regard the inclusion of such a provision in the Bill of great importance to ensure that arrangements that are as satisfactory as possible are made for any dependent children. It is also a matter for consideration whether the court should be enabled to make property orders for the benefit of any dependent children, not just the spouse as is proposed in the Bill. Generally, on the financial and property order provisions in the Bill, might I say at the outset that, apart from the one I have just mentioned, there are various aspects of those provisions which I think could be improved. There is, for example, no provision to nullify or render void transactions designed to frustrate the making of orders by the court. Under the Bill the Court will have power to make an order conferring on one spouse, either for life or for such shorter period as the court may decide, the right to occupy the family home to the exclusion of the other spouse. In the alternative, the court may order the sale of the family home, or any property of a [899] spouse, but in this regard the powers of the court under the Bill appear to be limited to sale of property held by the spouses jointly or in common. Provided that the power being given to the court to transfer property is constitutionally sound — I will come to that question in a moment — it would appear that the court should be given wider powers as to sale of property and generally to ensure that adequate and proper provision, having regard to the circumstances, is made for any spouse and dependent child. There is, of course, the important question as to whether the provisions giving the court discretion to transfer property as between the spouses or between a spouse and his or her dependent children could give rise to constitutional challenge. This is a matter on which I am seeking the advice of the Attorney General. However, I might say that I would regard the inclusion of such provisions as being a particularly important aspect of the Bill and it was my intention, provided they were not regarded as being constitutionally unacceptable, to propose similar type provisions to those included in the Bill. It would, under the Bill, be open to persons who have separation agreements to apply for a judicial separation and any ancillary order as to maintenance, lump sums, property etc. It might be a matter for consideration also as to whether persons who have a divorce a mensa et thoro should be allowed, if they wish, apply to court under the new financial and property provisions in the legislation. Section 4 of the Bill provides safeguards to ensure that the spouses are aware of alternatives, namely, counselling and mediation, to court proceedings in separation cases. There could be some strengthening of those provisions to provide that the court itself would be required to address itself to the possibility of reconciliation or, if reconciliation is not possible, to whether mediation procedures, designed to achieve the maximum degree of agreement [900] between the parties on the terms of their separation, should be invoked. The Bill provides for certain changes in procedures: family business in the Circuit Court would in future be conducted in a 'family circuit court' family business in all the courts would be conducted as informally as possible and neither judges nor barristers would wear wigs or gowns. I am disposed generally to changes along those lines but, unlike the Bill, I think that the High Court should continue to have jurisdiction in judicial separation proceedings because ancillary orders may be made which concern property, the value of which exceeds the present jurisdictional limits of the Circuit Court. It is the case, of course, that parties could as at present consent to having the matter dealt with in the Circuit Court. There may be a difficulty however, concerning section 22 of the Bill under which the circuit family court would have to sit in a different place or at different times or on different days from those on which the ordinary sittings of the Circuit Court are held. The difficulty arises in relation to the sittings of the court outside Dublin. There would, I understand, be no difficulty in relation to Dublin. What the Bill seems to require is that either two judges should be sitting together in a town thus requiring a separate venue, or that, if there is only one judge, he or she should allocate a separate day or days for family law business exclusively. Having regard to existing commitments in the Circuit Court, it is quite likely that if this mandatory provision were enacted, it would give rise to extra Exchequer spending from the point of view of staffing. I have already indicated to the House on a previous occasion that the institution of family courts could be very costly in buildings and staff and, therefore, is out of the question in present financial circumstances. In view of this it may be necessary to amend the Bill to provide only that the Circuit Court should, as far as practicable, when hearing family law cases sit in a different place or at different times. In conclusion, among the other matters in the Bill which are of concern to me are [901] the following. There appears to be some doubt as to how conduct of a spouse would be taken into account when the court is making orders other than maintenance orders and this may need to be clarified. Another matter concerns the provision in the Bill abolishing the bars to a decree of judicial separation, subject to retention of condonation, conduct which condones the behaviour of the other spouse, in a modified form — sections 3 and 32. On the basis that a person should not be allowed benefit from his own wrongdoing there appears to be a good case for retaining connivance as a bar, that is, where a decree is sought on the grounds of adultery and the other party proves that the adultery was committed with the connivance of the applicant, the decree should be refused. If this Bill is enacted it will add substantially to the very few examples of Private Members' Bills that have been enacted. When the Government's views on the matters I am putting to them have been made known it will be necessary to refer them to the parliamentary draftsman for the drafting of any amendments that might be required. This will take time and it will be necessary to allow an adequate period to elapse before Committee Stage to allow the drafting to be done. Having said that, I can assure the sponsor of whatever assistance and cooperation is necessary to have the Bill made law as soon as possible. As I said at the outset, I am happy to support the principle of the Bill and I commend Deputy Shatter on bringing it to the House.",02/02/1988,25,621,622,courts should have wider powers to grant a decree and to make ancillary orders of the kind dealt with by,Deputy Shatter,in this Bill The limited value of divorce a mensa et thoro decrees at present is reflected in the small,Deputy Shatter,2343020_4,,courts should have wider powers to grant a decree and to make ancillary orders of the kind dealt with by Deputy Shatter in this Bill The limited value of divorce a mensa et thoro decrees at present is reflected in the small,courts should have wider powers to grant a decree and to make ancillary orders of the kind dealt with by in this Bill The limited value of divorce a mensa et thoro decrees at present is reflected in the small,text841,2,0,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-1.609437912,-0.040235948,-0.245076519,-0.006126913,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.024024024,0.067067067,0.091091091,0.12012012,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3730354,476,11,73,Budget Statement 2006.,06/12/2006,Mr. Tony Gregory (Deceased),Independent,Dublin Central,"Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí Neamhspleácha as an deis a thabhairt dom labhairt faoin gcáinaisnéis anocht. The Independent Deputies wish to restate their commitment to the effect that they will always side with working people and the disadvantaged in society. That is our mandate and will be our priority in this House. We will do so as voices from the backbenches, as we are today, or, in the future, as a group of Independents in a more strategic position to influence Government policy. It is our objective to try to achieve a fairer society. To achieve this aim, the budget should be used as a mechanism to redistribute the wealth of the country to benefit those most in need, including the elderly, sick, disabled and disadvantaged, and the carers and working people who struggle to survive on low incomes. If we examine the budgets of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Governments for the past nine years, we see clearly that the vast majority of budgetary measures have consistently ben[147]efited the better-off much more than those most in need. This is a matter of record and has resulted in an increasingly unequal society. The creation of such inequality is the very opposite to the pursuit of fairness. We stand for fairness and equality. There are undoubtedly positive measures in today’s budget, some perhaps motivated by the impending general election. In the past nine years, when Ireland’s economy became one of the strongest through the labour of its workers, the same Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, through arrogant mismanagement, left our hospitals in crisis. Elderly people have been left on trolleys night after night and people on waiting lists have been denied hospital treatment in a two-tier system in which access to health care is based on ability to pay rather than the urgency of one’s medical needs. Some aspects of the health service provided by the Government were labelled the shame of Europe when Ireland was listed a shameful 25th out of 26 countries in a European health consumer survey. The Independent Members, including Deputy Connolly in Cavan-Monaghan, Deputy James Breen in Ennis and Deputy McHugh in Tuam, have championed the cause of addressing the requirement to have modern local hospital services available to all in need. These Deputies, with the full support of their Independent colleagues, have tirelessly focused attention on the health care needs of their communities, but the Government continues to fail to provide the hospital services so urgently needed. The budget proposes to double the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers. This is welcome in itself but rising interest rates will neutralise this measure. It should not be permitted to obscure the fact that owing a home of one’s own has become unattainable for many. For many more, the only way they can achieve this basic human right is to take on crippling life-long mortgages. The Government failed to take action to control the price of building land, the only measure that would have kept house prices down. The Government capitulated to its builder-developer friends and reneged on the provision of thousands of social and affordable homes. Many families could now be in such homes had Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats stood firm against the cartel of builders, but they let the people down, which is a shame. Had they stood firm, the common good would have been pitted against vested and organisational interests, which the Minister bragged about today. However, they failed to do so.",06/12/2006,29,345,345,of Europe when Ireland was listed a shameful 25th out of 26 countries in a European health consumer survey The,Independent,Members including Deputy Connolly in Cavan-Monaghan Deputy James Breen in Ennis and Deputy McHugh in Tuam have championed the cause,Independent,3730354_2,,of Europe when Ireland was listed a shameful 25th out of 26 countries in a European health consumer survey The Independent Members including Deputy Connolly in Cavan-Monaghan Deputy James Breen in Ennis and Deputy McHugh in Tuam have championed the cause,of Europe when Ireland was listed a shameful 25th out of 26 countries in a European health consumer survey The Members including Deputy Connolly in Cavan-Monaghan Deputy James Breen in Ennis and Deputy McHugh in Tuam have championed the cause,text861,2,1,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-0.510825624,-0.012770641,-0.063245553,-0.001581139,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.186186186,0.199199199,0.262262262,0.27027027,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4125474,2182,9,88,Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed),08/07/2010,Mr. Terence Flanagan,Fine Gael,Dublin North-East,"I welcome the opportunity to continue my contribution on this important legislation. I would like to mention other difficulties faced by apartment owners with regard to the Bill. For example, on the issue of satisfactory completion of a development, there is no legal means of ensuring that a development is satisfactorily completed. The meaning attached to 'satisfactory completion' is open to interpretation and is quite vague. The Minister needs to look at this. The key issue is to ensure the developer completes the individual phases of the development properly and within the terms and conditions set down under the planning permission he was granted. I am interested in the Minister of State’s view on that issue. Both the Law Reform Commission and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland have recommended in regard to the completion of common areas that 5% of the purchase price should be retained and ring-fenced for the completion of unfinished developments. Fine Gael will table an amendment on Committee Stage to include this provision in the Bill. The Bill points to the courts as arbiters in disputes between owners and management companies. This is the wrong approach to take. The National Property Services Regulatory Authority was set up in 2005, more than five years ago, and has thus far been nothing more than a toothless quango. More than €3 million has been spent by that office to date, but it has not had any statutory work to complete. That authority should be the first port of call in terms of providing mediation services in cases of dispute or where owners have concerns in regard to the calculation of management fees. Recourse to the courts is inconsistent with Government policy in this area and contrary to best practice, and we propose to bring forward an amendment to address this issue. Moreover, consideration should be given to merging the National Property Services Regulatory Authority and the Private Residential Tenancies Board to ensure greater economies of scale. [458]In regard to management companies’ records, there should be random audits by the regulator to ensure proper records are being kept and that companies are complying with the legislation. Such inspections should be variously announced and unannounced. There is evidence that a number of management companies currently in operation are not keeping proper records. In regard to voting rights, the Bill indicates that there will be one vote per unit owner, but this will apply only to new developments. What about residents of existing apartment complexes where there are major difficulties, with owners suffering because the developer has dominated the running of the management company? Those people are trapped and the legislation will be of little help to them. Will the Minister of State comment on that? We must address the issue of management companies that are too large and become insolvent. In Clongriffin, in my own constituency, there are mixed management companies dealing with both apartment complexes and houses. These companies have grown too large and massive arrears have built up. Law abiding citizens who pay their fees are suffering because more than 60% of management fees is outstanding. It should have been the case that one management company was set up for each block of apartments rather than one large entity that is not in a position to deal effectively with the affairs of so many owners. We welcome the introduction of monetary sinking funds. However, the €200 charge seems very low when one considers the situation in existing complexes where there are problems with elevators and deterioration of exteriors. Significant sums will have to be collected to fix buildings that are in disrepair. Property management agents are currently unregulated and unlicensed, leaving many owners exposed and vulnerable. The Minister must bring the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, which was recently passed by the Seanad, before the Dáil as soon as possible. The regulation of property agents must go hand in hand with the regulation of property management companies. Fine Gael supports much of what is proposed in the Bill, including the name change from management companies to owners’ management companies. This change emphasises that the unit owners are the real owners and that it is they, rather than developers and others, who should be in full control of management companies. As I said, the establishment of sinking funds is welcome, as is the setting and collection of service charges and the provision that there will be one vote per householder. We also support the obligation on developers to hand over the ownership of common areas of completed developments to the owners’ management company within six months. In regard to the calling of the annual general meeting, the provision that 21 days’ notice must be given to all owners and that owners’ management companies will be in a position to make house rules is welcome. The Bill fails, however, to address an issue that has been highlighted in correspondence from Fine Gael and other organisations, namely, the position in regard to single-owner management companies where there are both houses and apartments which require differing levels of maintenance and services. Owners of houses in such developments currently feel they are getting a raw deal in having to contribute to costs that are not relevant to them since they do not share common areas to the same extent as do apartment complex dwellers. They are aggrieved at having to pay the same management fees as apartment owners when all they generally require in the way of communal maintenance is grass cutting and landscaping. This issue must be reviewed. They should be made fully responsible for ensuring there are fire extinguishers on all floors and that they are working. Local authorities should grant fire certificates only if equipment is present and fully operational. The practice of issuing fire certificates without inspecting buildings must no longer continue. This is another example of light touch or absence [459]of regulation in this country. Developers could produce the most perfect of drawings and be granted fire certificates without a fire officer from a local authority stepping foot in a given apartment complex to ensure everything is up to the proper standards and that owners could have full confidence that there is no threat to their safety while living in apartment complexes. I refer to service fees. Certain apartment dwellers pay a service fee on a yearly basis. The legislation should state that the companies must use the fees collected for fire safety equipment and to ensure it is present on all floors and in apartments. This should be tied into the legislation as well. I welcome the introduction of the legislation, although there are many holes in it. It has been watered down a good deal since its initial introduction in the Seanad. In this regard, a new explanatory memorandum should be produced because the Government has effectively produced a new Bill. Apartment owners are not pleased that the legislation is a good deal looser than when it was initially introduced. The Minister should provide the House with a proper explanation of why it has taken so long, almost a decade, since the regulation of management companies was first mooted. Why has the Minister taken so long to get it to this stage? Meanwhile, apartment owners are being fleeced as a result of continuous rises in annual service fees. Many are aggrieved that they have not been receiving a proper service and that there has been no one to turn to for dispute resolution or for any grievances they hold with regard to the maintenance of their complex. Some 500,000 people, including many young people, who live in apartment complexes suffer on a continuous or daily basis. This legislation is unlikely to make much difference to these people in the short term, but hopefully it will do so in the longer term. Many home owners have paid exorbitant money to purchase apartments in complexes and, at a minimum, tight legislation should be in place to protect them, to secure their rights and such that there is someone who can help them with any relevant difficulties. We know there are many insolvent management companies at present and that fees have not been collected consistently by management agents because certain companies are not functioning correctly. Will the Minister advise on what will happen in cases of extreme difficulty or dire financial situations which arise in an apartment complexes? Who will put things right? Will the State intervene or what will happen ultimately? Hundreds of unfinished housing estates throughout the country are made up of mixed developments and contain unfinished apartment blocks. What will happen to these and what is the future of these unfinished apartment blocks. We envisage this legislation as a first step.

1036073,228,14,181,"Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1960. —Second Stage.",07/07/1960,Mr. Brendan Corish,The Labour Party,Wexford,"Needless to remark, we do not oppose the slight increase proposed [1143] in this measure. Whilst, as the last speaker said, the Minister has tried to dress up a good case he has, I think, condemned himself. He certainly gives the lie to the exaggeration inherent in his claims when he admits that approximately £800,000 will have to be provided over a full year among 250,000 people. If my figures are correct, and I think I am being generous to the Minister when I say £800,000, each recipient will benefit to the extent of about 60/- per year. I suppose the average benefit, as is generally suggested in the Bill, would be a shilling per week and, as I said, we welcome any increase that is given. In my opinion, however, whilst arguments for greater increases might be all very well in themselves they are of secondary importance to a matter that I consider of the utmost importance at present— to ask ourselves who is responsible for poor people in this country? Nominally the Minister for Social Welfare is responsible for people who have no income, who are sick, who are unemployed, who are widows or who are old age pensioners, but in actual fact there does not seem to be anyone who takes absolute responsibility for the provision of assistance to people who have no money. A sort of see-saw game takes place between the local authorities and the Minister in this connection. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, particularly at Question Time, when asked about the amount of various allowances given by his Department, has often said that he does not expect people to live on these allowances exclusively and that local authorities should, and in many cases do, come to the assistance of the recipients of such assistance. The plain fact of the matter, however, is that boards of assistance and public assistance authorities do not take anything like the responsibility that has been imposed upon them by this House for people who find themselves poverty-stricken. The usual attitude of local boards of assistance is that if a person has any sort of allowance, an old age pension, unemployment assistance, sickness benefit, disability [1144] benefit or any other allowance, that is the full extent of the responsibility of the people of the country towards that individual recipient and they refuse to assist him further or, if they do, give only a very small pittance. I shall take for example an old age pensioner who lives on his own and who, at the present time, receives 27/6d. a week. Under this Bill he will receive 28/6d. a week and there is no necessity for me to hold up the House in describing how difficult it is for anyone to live on 27/6d. or 28/6d. a week. To say the least of it, we all appreciate it is very difficult. The responsibility one local authority assumes in such a case is to give an extra 5/- a week which means that person has 32/6d. a week on which to live and I do not think that is good enough. On the one hand we have the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary saying that the public assistance authorities should assist such people but, on the other hand, we have the public assistance authorities who say it is the State's responsibility to cater for many of our unemployed, whether they be on the dole or in receipt of benefit. The State has a particular responsibility for them and so have the local authorities but between these two bodies what I describe as the utmost responsibility is not taken for people who find they have no money by reason of sickness, old age, widowhood and many of the other hazards of life. On page 14 of his speech the Minister for Social Welfare referred to the 'great influence of social welfare expenditure upon the Budget and therefore upon taxation' and went on to say: I make no apology for referring to these facts again especially for the benefit of Deputies who suggested, when the Estimates for my Department were before the House, that the increases announced in the Budget might have been greater. I think we have far too many statements of that kind. Some of us in this House seem to think that a big Bill for social welfare is something to be ashamed of but I do not think [1145] so. When talking about social welfare some of us seem to think that it merely means payment to people who are unemployed, to people who are sick, to old age pensioners, to widows and orphans, but these from only one category of social welfare and there are many other categories for which we should have regard as well. I remember Deputy Dr. Browne asking the Minister for Finance how much we spend on social welfare from the Budget each year and the Minister replied, I believe rightly so, that about 90 per cent. of our State expenditure goes on social welfare. We never criticise the fact that we spend practically as much on agriculture as we do on social welfare. If my memory serves me correctly the amount we propose to spend on agriculture this year ranges from anything between £22,000,000 and £30,000,000. I am not objecting to that in the slightest. As far as this House is concerned that could also be regarded as a social welfare expenditure. Any person who wants to build a house for himself gets a free grant provided he fulfils very simple conditions. He gets something like £300 and that is another reason why we should not complain, or appear to complain, about the amount we spend on social welfare. Another item of social welfare that could well be mentioned is the amount we give by way of assistance, call it what you will, social assistance, or industrial assistance, for the improvement of hotels and the building of new hotels. Someone may say that is all productive work and that we shall get a return in industry and in agriculture, but surely it is unfair to distinguish between the type of people who cannot give a return through no fault of their own, and those people who not alone will give a return to the country but will give a pretty good return to themselves? That is one of the reasons why I believe this shilling all-round increase is not good enough. To say the least, I do not think it would do any harm to give much more to people who are unemployed, to people who are sick, to widows, old age pensioners and [1146] orphans because the State can at least be assured that the money they get will not be sent out of the country. The old age pensioners almost exclusively will but Irish produced goods because their main items of expenditure are food and clothing, things which are produced here. It seems to me a very contradictory situation. On the one hand the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary, as is his wont, say this country cannot afford any more than one shilling a week increase in such assistance. That has been the cry of the Minister this morning—that though we would love to do it we cannot afford to do it. On the other hand, we have had a virtual boast from the Taoiseach and members of the Government that in the past two years we have not alone recovered from what they describe as the disastrous years of 1956 and 1957 but our economic position has vastly improved. In the Budget debate and in all the main financial debates in this House during the present year members of the Government Party were at pains to describe how the national income has gone up, how unemployment has gone down, how industry has boomed, how agriculture is holding its own, how the tourist trade has developed and improved. We have heard a lot about the great prospects for the tourist industry this year and for the years to come. Nevertheless, all we can do is to give the old age pensioners, the widows and the unemployed an increase of 1/- per week in their pensions. Surely it is a Gilbertian situation where on the one hand we boast that the country is improving economically by great strides and on the other hand we say we cannot afford any more than 1/- per week increase in pensions to old age pensioners and to people on unemployment assistance? The present Government have given three increases to old age pensioners since they came into office in March, 1957, which total 4/6d. per week. They point out that in the period of office of the last inter-Party Government only 2/6d. was given. Those figures are correct. I suppose that at this stage there would be no use in saying, without a gibe and maybe a justifiable one, that the inter-Party Government had two [1147] Budgets and, therefore, two opportunities, so to speak, to make provision for such people as against four Budgets which the present Government have had. That is not the point I want to make. The Minister for Social Welfare or any member of the Government may try to argue that there has been no appeciable change in the cost of living index number in the past 12 months and that any increase given to old age pensioners and such persons is a generous gesture on the part of the Government. I think they will have to go beyond the past 12 months. As far as old age pensioners are concerned, I think they will have to disregard to some extent the cost of living index number. The people with whom this Bill deals are not concerned with a large number of items in the cost of living index. It includes many items of expenditure that are usual in respect of a big majority of our people. However, many of these items of expenditure are not peculiar to old age pensioners, to people on the dole and to many widows and orphans. These people are concerned mainly with the price of food and, say, the rents of houses, two items which have increased to a very large extent in the past three years. In two Budgets in a period of three years, the inter-Party Government gave an increase of 2/6 to old age pensioners. That was a period during which the price of the food, according to the cost of living index figure, increased by 4 per cent. However, from March, 1957, to February, 1960, the price of food, again according to the cost of living index figure, increased by 12 per cent. For that reason and for no other reason there should be a much greater increase for old age pensioners and for recipients of unemployment assistance and benefits such as widows and orphans pensions, and so on. Apart from what the last Government, the previous Fianna Fáil Government, or any Fianna Fáil Government did, or what a Cumann na nGaedheal Government did, it is time we tried to pin responsibility in respect [1148] of poor people with no means. I believe the local authorities are not doing their job in that respect and I have no hesitation in saying so. As far as I know, under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, this House imposed upon local authorities—and when I say 'local authorities' I means also boards of assistance—and the ratepayers of each county responsibility for looking after people with no incomes but they do not do it. It is not the officials who do not do it it is the elected representatives who do not do it. Why talk about legal responsibility in respect of poor people? There is a grave moral responsibility on each and every county to look after people with no means. Nobody wants them to look after wastrels or spendthrifts but they are expected to look after the genuine poor. If the local authorities are not prepared to do that and, up to this, they have not shown evidence that they are prepared to accept their full responsibility we must consider the early introduction of a scheme on the lines of the British system of national assistance and let the State pay. I do not means the State should take on the full responsibility and allow the ratepayers to get off scot free. If necessary, we should get a contribution from them. It is pathetic to see or to know a person who has no money, who is not an old age pensioner, who is not receiving unemployment assistance, sickness benefit or disability benefit, a person who has absolutely nothing and who is handed out 10/- or even 15/- per week by a local authority. Very seldom if ever do they go to £1 per week. Sometimes one hears it said about such a person: 'He is a wastrel. I saw him at the pictures last night. He was at a dance last Sunday. He has got a new suit.' They give him nothing because of what may appear to them to be signs of prosperity. The Minister should seriously consider what should be done about what I would term the poor of this country. I welcome some of the changes which may appear insignificant in this measure. One does not come across such cases very often but they are [1149] very irritating when one does. Especially do I welcome the Minister's proposal to allow pensions to inmates of mental hospitals. His proposal is that a sum of money, the pension, may be used by the inmates of a mental hospital. Has the Minister considered making some part of that pension payable to a near relative who, say, has to undergo certain expense in providing comforts for the inmate? Many relatives travel frequently to mental hospitals and take comforts with them to the patient which in the ordinary course of events would not be provided by the hospital. If the Minister would consider covering that point, the Bill would be further improved. The proposal for an easement of the means test in respect of widows pensions is also welcomed. The Labour Party naturally welcome the abolition of the three day waiting period. It is something which was a source of annoyance to workers generally for very many years and I am glad the Minister has got sanction from the Government to do away with that burden on workers who transferred from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance. There never did seem to be any good reason for it and its removal is a very good improvement. At paragraph 11 of his speech, the Minister says: In calculating means for old age pension and widows' pension purposes the maintenance allowances payable to distressed persons under Section 50 of the Health Act, 1950 are legally assessable. The present Bill Provides in Section 13 for the disregard of these allowances and proposes to put them on the same footing as the allowance, of a somewhat similar nature, payable under Section 44 of the Health Act, 1947. I do not think he need have bothered about that at all. It is very difficult to obtain a distressed person's maintenance allowance from the local authority where one is in receipt of any social assistance allowance from the Department. However, for many [1150] of the good local authorities, it is a lead and it does prevent them from assessing a distressed person's maintenance allowance as means. The Minister also introduced an excellent proposal. I am sure it will not cost him a great deal of money but it is a proposal that will ease the means test in respect of a person who is in receipt of an old age pension and who also has a pension from some other source. I think that is an excellent improvement. In many parts of the country, this point crops up from time to time. There are people who had pensions from the British navy or army or some other similar source and who, when they got an increased pension from Britain, discovered, when their means were reassessed, that they suffered a big reduction in their Irish old age pension. In the final analysis, it meant that in total pension, they had less. The only thing I should like to refer to, in conclusion, is the general question of the means test. I do not remember what it would cost the Minister or the State to make an improvement in that respect but I think these figures in the reassessment of means have obtained for quite a long time. We all agree that money values have changed. Incomes have changed and values generally have changed. I think there is a good case for an easement of the means test. I do not believe that an easement of the means test will affect to any great degree the existing recipients of the old age pension because I think that well over 50 per cent of them are old age pensioners who have the maximum pension and who have no means whatsoever, but there are, I suppose, many other cases where an easement of the means test would mean an increase in the old age pension. This is described as a Social Welfare Bill but I do not know whether it would include this item or not. There seems to be an impression that the Minister for Social Welfare contemplates centralising the administration of the services for which he is responsible and that the tendency is to centralise [1151] the administration of all these services in Dublin. How that can be done successfully, I cannot imagine. I complained here on one occasion about the discontinuance of the post of local agent in a particular part of the country and confessed afterwards in the House that I thought it had worked out pretty well in respect of sickness benefit. I do not think that the same sort of thing would apply in respect of old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions, particularly where there must be a man on the spot to interview these applicants. I do not think means can be assessed from Dublin. The personal interview is of tremendous advantage, not alone to the Minister and his Department but to the applicant. However, the Minister has not mentioned it. Is it only a rumour that the centralisation of the sickness benefit administration is a pointer to the centralisation of the administration of all the services in the Minister's Department?",07/07/1960,16,1857,1858,widows and orphans pensions and so on Apart from what the last Government the previous Fianna Fáil Government or any,Fianna Fáil,Government did or what a Cumann na nGaedheal Government did it is time we tried to pin responsibility in respect,Fianna Fáil,1036073_2,,widows and orphans pensions and so on Apart from what the last Government the previous Fianna Fáil Government or any Fianna Fáil Government did or what a Cumann na nGaedheal Government did it is time we tried to pin responsibility in respect,widows and orphans pensions and so on Apart from what the last Government the previous Fianna Fáil Government or any Government did or what a Cumann na nGaedheal Government did it is time we tried to pin responsibility in respect,text388,1,2,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.510825624,0.012770641,-0.390434405,-0.00976086,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.592592593,0.035035035,0.063063063,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1571405,631,8,137,"Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1972: Second Stage (Resumed).",30/11/1972,Mr. Patrick Lenihan,Fianna Fáil,Longford -Westmeath,"In a revolutionary or quasi-revolutionary situation it is the duty of whatever Government occupy these benches to make a careful assessment of the situation, and we have made a very careful assessment of it. Indeed, Deputies here have criticised us for not jumping in immediately to deal with this matter. We decided to allow the ordinary processes under the ordinary legislation to proceed. The first step we took to deal with the situation was the inauguration of the Special Criminal Courts earlier this year. That was done after very careful consideration. Since then we have been further advised as to inadequacies that enabled prominent leaders of illegal organisations to display themselves on the media and to display themselves publicly. As the Taoiseach said here last night, these prominent leaders were shrewd enough not to be involved in any direct action which could bring them before the ordinary courts. Faced with that situation, and similar types of situations arising out of the inadequacies in the legal system, we decided on the advice of the chief officers of the Garda force and on the advice of the independent law officers to proceed in this way and introduce this legislation. I should like to say in conclusion, because I have covered some of this ground before Question Time, that this is a matter that should concern all of us in a far more serious way than I fear it has been taken to be heretofore, particularly by the Fine Gael Party. The Fine Gael Party, in my view, have walked into a hasty situation caused by their own internal problems. This is far too serious a matter to be taken on the basis merely of taking the mickey out of Fianna Fáil. That is not what this is about at all. What this is about is not Fianna Fáil or Labour or Fine Gael. What this is about is whether we are going to have government here [548] through people elected democratically or whether we are going to have government in the streets or elsewhere by people who have no democratic responsibility to the people of the country. This is what it is about. It is not about Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or Labour. It is about government and where the responsibility of government lies.

1061617,59,8,48,"Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961—Fifth Stage.",17/05/1961,Mr. Neil T. Blaney,Fianna Fáil,Donegal East,"I had hoped that on the last stage of the Bill we would have had some expression from the Opposition that would have given food for thought regarding a matter so serious as a revision of constituencies. Instead we have merely had a repetition—I may say a somewhat watered-down repetition—of various charges that have been levelled here on all stages of this Bill and for which no tittle of evidence has been produced. In the early stages of the discussion the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, made a very short contribution in a rather flippant way but, at the same time, had the first 'go' at throwing what mud he could think of. Then he baled out of the House to be followed by his Party henchmen as the debate went on. I doubt if Deputy Dillon believed one word that he said when he charged the Government and the Minister for Local Government with gerrymandering in this measure. If we go back to the debates we find that at Column 206 of the Report of the 12th April, 1961, Deputy Dillon himself demolished the grounds on which he could make the charge that gerrymandering had taken place or is taking place when he said: 'I think that here an effective gerrymander cannot be done.' That was after he had made the charge that it was being done. Of course, there were others who fell into the same charges and then demolished their own arguments. Deputy Corish, for instance, continued the attack on the lines that Deputy Dillon commenced with and he also, at a later stage in the same debate— Column 210, Volume 188 of the Official Report—said: [516] However, that is another story and I do not think this Bill will have a great effect on the result of the next general election. Again, if gerrymandering is, in fact, the motive behind the various parts of this Bill and if the word means what we have been led to believe it means, gerrymander carried out by a political Party or a Minister would surely be expected to result in a political advantage unfairly got or given to his own Party. We have the charge and then we have the disavowal of there being any grounds for that charge by the very same person who had made it. We had another example of this view on gerrymandering in this country. Deputy O'Donnell, on 28th October, 1959, as reported at Column 415 of Volume 177 said: It is most difficult to arrange such a revision of constituencies without a charge of political corruption or gerrymandering.... He had himself been a Minister for Local Government and had initiated the moves that would bring about the Bill for a revision of constituencies and, therefore, could be regarded as a person who had some knowledge of what he talked of. That is what he said even on the 1959 Bill which was later disputed and declared to be unconstitutional by the courts. I am sure he has not changed his view in that regard since. It is true, of course, that these statements by the people whom I have quoted in on way prevented others following and making the charges again. Of course, we had Deputy McGilligan following his leader on that occasion and continuing in the same vein here today. I would say to Deputy McGilligan and to other knowledgeable Deputies that if there were brought into this House a constituency revision Bill, which was conceived, produced and had the blessing of Deputy McGilligan, it would still meet with opposition from very many quarters in this House, no matter what shape that Bill had. Deputy McGilligan knows that well, but, of course, that does not stop him coming in here today to continue his charges of a political gerrymander for party advantage, charges [517] of doing things that there was no necessity to do, and so on. In going through the debates one thing which has struck me very forcibly and which typifies the vacillating points of view expressed by Deputies opposing various parts of the Bill is the statement made by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy O'Donnell. Deputy Sweetman, as reported at Column 308 of the Official Report of 12th April, 1961, said in reference to my constituency in Donegal that it was designed to suit the Minister for Local Government on the one hand, and to get rid of Deputy Sheldon on the other. We have reduced the representation of that constituency to three and it is said that it is to suit the Minister for Local Government and to get rid of Deputy Sheldon whereas, under the 1959 Act, when it was proposed to retain without change the representation of that constituency, we had Deputy O'Donnell, as reported at column 417, Volume 177 of the Official Report, saying as follows: We saw the Independent Deputy for East Donegal voting in favour of proportional representation as Deputy Desmond pointed out. We now see the consideration for his having so supported the Government. The consideration is that we are going to leave him a safe seat in East Donegal, which he or his successor may retain for the next 12 years. That is the consideration given to him for his support of the Government. When we were leaving the seat, Deputy O'Donnell attacked us and said that we were really paying Deputy Sheldon for his allegiance to Fianna Fáil or for his vote on proportional representation. When it comes to this Bill we have Deputy Sweetman of the same Party and the same front bench of Fine Gael saying, now that the seat is being taken out of East Donegal, that the constituency was designed to suit the Minister for Local Government and to get rid of Deputy Sheldon. These are two front benchers of the Fine Gael Party and these are their views as expressed in relation to a particular constituency and in relation [518] to a particular Deputy and in relation to the motives of the Minister for Local Government, the same Minister on each occasion. We have Fine Gael backing the two horses in the same race. It is the old story, 'heads, I win harps, you lose.' They just cannot lose if they can keep on codding the public with statements which are completely contradictory, relying on the forgetfulness of the public. If a few months elapse between the making of one statement and the next, the public will have forgotten and will not realise that the two statements are contradictory and disprove each other. That is a typical example of the manner in which this measure has been approached and the veiled threats and allegations that have been made here and which, certainly, are no credit to those who made them. We have Deputy McGilligan today saying that the court decision was so strong that the Government did not dare challenge it. I do not know whom he is trying to bait or for what purpose. He goes on then to say—I felt at the time he was bordering on the brink of the greatest possible disrespect—that he could not see how the President could be relied upon to refer the legislation to the courts. I felt that that was badly taken. I trust that what seemed to me to be implied in that was not really the intention of the Deputy but, the Deputy being such an able manipulator of words, I question very much if I misunderstood. However, he then waltzes around, as he did on the final discussion of the 1959 Bill, and now expresses the beliefs and the fears that the Constitution again is being violated in regard to constituencies and in regard to the census having been taken, as he puts it, and then he waddles off from that and has a dart in another direction. The ratio is questioned again and he says the ratio, according to the Constitution, should be maintained the same throughout the country. Furthermore, he says that in regard to the mathematical calculation in this matter we should have regard even to the point of dividing the country to such a degree that only townlands [519] and streets or half streets would in fact come into the reckoning. Again, the inference to be drawn there is that we have not balanced it finely enough and that on the basis of the census of April 9th last this measure is, in Deputy McGilligan's learned opinion, unconstitutional. However, he seems to be far from opposing it. What does Deputy McGilligan really mean? Does he want the Bill really declared unconstitutional or is he talking with his tongue in his cheek in saying that he wants to see the Bill through so that we can get to the country in a general election as quickly as possible? I think the most reasonable contribution made here this evening was that of Deputy Norton. He has pointed out, and rightly so, his belief that the operations which have had to be taken under this Bill may, in fact, disfranchise groups of people in South Meath and in the eastern parts of Westmeath by their being added in such small numbers, in relation to the whole, to Kildare. I agree with the Deputy wholeheartedly. Other people have made the same comment. The only difference between myself and those who assert such things is that I went into the court to try and prove my point whereas the people who now make these statements did not lift a finger to point that out. I am very sorry indeed that those people did not take such positive action when the matter was before the court as they now suggest they have adopted. Had they done so at the time, I believe the court decision could very well have been quite different. However, that cannot be helped now. We are dealing with a fait accompli. I agree with Deputy Norton that the people of South Meath and many in Westmeath who are now added to Kildare are at a disadvantage in that they will not have the due weight of representation which they might have enjoyed had they remained as part of their respective counties. I have not been enabled in respect of those areas to have regard to the existing boundaries which had become so well defined that people [520] now object strongly to their being taken out of them. All in all, the position may not be quite as catastrophic as Deputy Norton suggested but I do agree with him that this measure can in fact operate in a manner in respect of different parts of the country which will have unfair repercussions on the people concerned, so far as electoral representation is concerned. Some of them will know that we cannot help this kind of thing. Deputy Norton also said that the Constitution, if necessary, should be amended. There was much the same suggestion from other members of the Labour Party, as also from members of the Fine Gael Party. If there is to be an amendment of the Constitution in regard to a matter such as this, I have no doubt whatsoever that if the Parties opposite honestly feel as some of them have expressed themselves in the views put forward in the debate on this measure that the Government Party at the moment or at any other time will be as receptive as they were——",17/05/1961,16,247,248,was being done Of course there were others who fell into the same charges and then demolished their own arguments,Deputy Corish,for instance continued the attack on the lines that Deputy Dillon commenced with and he also at a later stage,Deputy Corish,1061617_4,,was being done Of course there were others who fell into the same charges and then demolished their own arguments Deputy Corish for instance continued the attack on the lines that Deputy Dillon commenced with and he also at a later stage,was being done Of course there were others who fell into the same charges and then demolished their own arguments for instance continued the attack on the lines that Deputy Dillon commenced with and he also at a later stage,text526,4,0,0,0,40,-0.1,-4,-2.197224577,-0.054930614,-0.197642354,-0.004941059,0.018018018,0.006006006,0.005005005,0.031031031,0.117117117,0.145145145,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2156988,352,9,115,National Economic and Social Plan: Motion (Resumed).,16/10/1984,Mr. Alan Dukes,Fine Gael,Kildare,"I hope we have an opportunity in the House to take up some of the points made by Deputy Ahern at the end of his remarks because they represent a very constructive approach and one which gets away from some traditions which have become rooted in our system and which are turning out to have the opposite effect to what was intended. Deputy Coveney wondered whether there was a possibility of getting consensus within this House on what the content, aims and objectives of a national plan should be. Having listened to Deputy Ahern I am not sure that there is any great prospect of getting consensus. If I have heard correctly over the past few days when other Members of the Opposition have been speaking, I doubt if there is any great prospect of reaching consensus on the matter with, for example, Deputy Reynolds and other people on that side of the House. We should look at why that is the case. Deputy Ahern supposed that this plan could have been worse. He said it was still deflationary and a statement of aspirations. I suppose those are some of the reasons Deputy Ahern would not give his full agreement. Why will he not give full agreement? I suspect it is because he did not pay much attention to the document called The Way Forward published in October 1982. I suspect that having gone through the process of producing this document, and particularly the analysis that underlies it, the Opposition, finding themselves in Opposition, decided to run away as fast as they could from the analysis they themselves made. If there is one reason we will not get consensus, that is it. The Opposition, following the publication of their plan, during the following election campaign and ever since have decided to run away from the analysis contained in the plan. I wonder what happened to it. I would not find a great deal of fault with much of the analysis [2527] in that document. What was wrong was something completely different. A lot of the analysis has much common ground with what is contained in our plan. The world has not changed all that much since October 1982. The problems we face and the answers to them have not changed all that much. What does seem to have changed is the preparedness of Deputies opposite to follow the logic of their own position, taken up both in Government and in Opposition. The plan we have published has two simple objectives. The first is to increase employment, especially sustainable employment, and the second is to halt the rise in taxation, both direct and indirect. Consistent with those two principal objectives, the plan has a number of complementary objectives which must be achieved if the central objectives are to be attained. Improved competitiveness, and especially labour cost competitiveness, is an obvious complementary objective which must first be achieved if sustainable employment is to be increased. We must take the international trading environment as given. I am not aware of any economy, or economic theory, which enables sustainable employment prospects to be improved without first improving competitiveness. This logical basis underlies the Government's plan. It also underlays The Way Forward and underlies the plans and strategies being used in all successful economies. The Government's pay objective is that increases in average pay in the private sector should not exceed those in competitor countries. This average is expected to grow by under 7 per cent a year. By comparison, The Way Forward expected that average pay increases in the private sector in Ireland would be moderated to achieve a 4 per cent gain in unit wage cost competitiveness each year. This implied a differential in the growth in wage costs with our competitors of 2-3 per cent in Ireland's favour. It is curious to note that Deputy Haughey now seems to have abandoned this line. Why is he still not proposing it? Perhaps [2528] it is because he agrees with me that in today's circumstances the realism of what the Government have put forward in this plan is self-evident. If we can do better than the conditions which we have put forward as the basis of this plan, then we will have an added bonus which will be reflected in an improved economic performance. We are not going to assume this better outcome because we do not think the conditions now justify making a more favourable assumption in relation to cost competitiveness than we have included in the plan. Increasing sustainable employment depends not only on improving the competitiveness of labour costs but also on improving market share. There are many factors which influence the share of world trade that Irish enterprises can capture. Two are especially influential in current circumstances — industrial expansion, especially in new technologically-based industries, and marketing. Their importance is recognised by the Government and exceptional provision has been made for both in the planned Departmental allocations set out in the plan. I refer, of course, to the substantially increased provisions which we have made for industrial grants and for the development of CTT activities along the lines set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy. Complementary to the second central objective of halting the rise in taxation is the need to restore balance to the public finances and especially to reduce the cost of servicing the national debt. Debt service costs can be reduced only if borrowing, particularly borrowing for unproductive purposes, is restrained. Total Exchequer borrowing in 1981 amounted to some 16¼ per cent of GNP. This Government has reduced it to 12¾ per cent of GNP for 1984 and plan to bring it down to under 10 per cent of GNP in 1987. These key figures are in themselves enough to show clearly the hollowness of Deputy Haughey's really extraordinary claim that no progress has been made in putting the public finances right: nothing could be further from the truth. Part of this reduction in Exchequer borrowing will come about autonomously [2529] as large scale capital projects are concluded, or, in some cases, removed from the Exchequer borrowing requirement, but part involves the scaling down of borrowing for current spending. If taxation is not to be increased, some curtailment of current spending programmes is inevitable. This inescapable fact of life is nevertheless now being disputed by the Opposition, in spite of the fact that they recognised it in The Way Forward. That document in planning to eliminate the current budget deficit by 1986, planned to reduce Exchequer current expenditure, other than debt service, from 38½ per cent of GNP in 1982 to about 30 per cent by 1987. Our target is just below 33 per cent of GNP in 1987, again underlining the realism which underlies our plan, and the rather two-faced approach of the Opposition to that kind of budgeting target. These figures show very clearly the incoherence and inconsistency of the Opposition's criticism, not only of this plan but also of the Government's economic policy since December 1982. As I have said, Deputy Haughey's professed aim when in Government was to reduce Exchequer current supply expenditure to a level substantially below our 1987 target as a proportion of GNP. Yet he and his colleagues on the Opposition benches criticise Government current expenditure policy as being too restrictive, although they were taking a far more restrictive view in October 1982. Deputy Haughey wrongly claims that no progress has been made in putting the public finances right, yet he criticises every measure taken with notable success by this Government to secure that aim. No wonder Deputy Reynolds spoke last week of 'quicksand and fantasy'— he and his Opposition colleagues are up to their oxters in them, if not a bit further up. I want to discuss the objectives and aims of this plan in a constructive manner and I would like to be able to discuss the Opposition's criticisms and counter-proposals in the same way, but I have been unable to find the necessary coherence in the Opposition's contributions and I have been totally unable to find. [2530] since December 1982, any counter-proposals from the Opposition. I will, however, deal with their main criticisms one by one in so far as my time allows. The first group of criticisms concern the framework and assumptions underpinning the plan. Deputy Haughey has stated that there are 'a number of very dubious assumptions and suspicious figures'. Deputy Reynolds stated that the figures underpinning the plan 'are highly speculative, built on quicksand and fantasy'. Let us look at a few of the key assumptions and forecasts. The growth rates forecast in the plan have been accepted by professional economists both nationally and internationally as broadly realistic and not based on wishful thinking. I understand that one group of consultants, not noted for an uncritical approach to Government policy, have gone so far as to state that the 'projections covering growth, external balance, employment and inflation are broadly right'. We have forecast GDP growth of 2½ per cent per annum over the three years 1985-87, at a time when we are reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP by an average of 1 per cent per annum. The projections underlying The Way Forward showed an average increase in GDP of 5 per cent per annum, while at the same time reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP by 2 per cent per annum. It takes very little thinking about those two sets of forecasts to determine where realism lies. There has been a fair amount of comment on the assumptions concerning interest and exchange rates in the plan. For those who have an interest in history, I will refer them to the assumptions in The Way Forward. It is very instructive reading, although I have the impression the Opposition want to write this out of the history books because they act as if it had never been published. The plan must be based on some assumptions concerning interest and exchange rates. They are not guarantees — I heard that phrase before, in October 1982. I can assure the House that if I [2531] could guarantee how United States interest and exchange rates would move over the next few years I would not be here. I would be working as a foreign exchange dealer making a killing, as a number of people might well have done if their hindsight of recent weeks had been in operation in 1979 or 1980. But they have not. To be useful, assumptions must be as realistic as we can reasonably make them. The assumptions we have used are based on the views of many international organisations and the considered opinion of leading world bankers. Over the last two years I have spent a good deal of time exploring and examining the state of financial opinion and these assumptions are informed by that work. They are also accepted as realistic by domestic economic commentators. Some play has been made here in the last few days of the fact that there was last week a tendency for US interest rates to firm up. This was advanced as another reason for being sceptical about the assumptions in the plan. Had we been having this discussion two weeks ago, I could perhaps have pointed to events on the US market showing a tendency for interest rates to weaken. Even today there is talk of a weakening in US prime rates. All one has to do is read today's Financial Times and one will see the latest buzz of speculation in that regard. I must say, however, that the opportunistic seizing on short-term movements in interest rates is no substitute for longerterm analysis and I would not for a moment claim that a slight weakening in the US prime rate today is another reason for having more confidence in the assumptions in the plan. For what it is worth, I would remind the House that in recent days two independent and respected economists, neither of whom is particularly reticent in criticising Government policy, have indicated that our assumptions in relation to interest rate movements and exchange rates are well founded. Having said that, I have no doubt that I will still be berated for accepting the [2532] advice, however well founded, of outsiders and rejecting the partisan criticisms of the Opposition. In this regard it might be useful to reflect on what Deputy Haughey said on introducing The Way Forward on 27 October 1982, column 150 of the Official Report. He said: It is based firmly on the skilled advice of all relevant Government Departments, including in particular the Department of Finance and of the Central Bank and independent economic experts. Since December 1982 he has criticised Government policy for being, in his view, excessively influenced by such advice. Why has he now changed his approach? Let him tell us. The House and the electorate are entitled to know. If he has had some blinding revelation or insight which means we can dispense with that kind of advice, let us hear it. But let us not have a situation where the Leader of the Opposition praises all that kind of advice when he is putting forward a plan and rejects it out of hand when he is not. I want to refer briefly to some remarks made in the House earlier today by Deputy Haughey concerning the movement of officials out of my Department. Deputy Haughey suggested that a number of people had left the Department of Finance — and I think I am quoting him right —'because they could not take the lies any longer'. I know the Opposition are stuck for arguments and counter-proposals, but to make that kind of statement in this House without the slightest foundation for it is nothing short of scandalous. The facts belie it. A number of the people in question left the Department of Finance on promotion to go to other Departments, a couple have gone to the private sector and another is on a career break. To seize on that as a reason for suggesting that people, some of whom would be in a position to give the kind of advice that Deputy Haughey criticises the Government for taking, are leaving the Department and as being in some way an argument against the kind of economic policies the Government are [2533] following is really a council of desperation and is scraping the bottom of the barrel. It is a pathetic sight. To expand further on the assumptions concerning external developments, I would say that they assume basically a slow, not spectacular recovery in demand, continued moderation in international inflation and stable exchange rate developments. The assumptions are neither unduly optimistic or pessimistic. They represent moderate assumptions now being made by international agencies. This may sound familiar. There is every reason why it should. It is a quotation from Deputy Haughey's speech introducing The Way Forward to this House — column 154 of the Official Report of 27 October 1982. This approach was, in his view, in order for The Way Forward but is evidently not so for Building on Reality where we used a similar procedure. I wonder why. Is it because it does not suit the kind of prejudgment which he would bring to a plan that carries the analysis that he had made further forward and makes decisions about it? Another criticism which has been raised in this House concerns the labour force projections underpinning the plan. This is quite a complex area. Assumptions must be made concerning mortality rates, net external migration, proportion of females married and single, fertility rates, labour force participation rates and so on. In view of the complexities involved the Government set up a working group from the relevant Departments and the two foremost demographic experts in the country, one from the ESRI and the other from NESC. This independent group, using the most up-to-date data available, produced independent estimates of the likely increase in the labour force over the period of the plan. The range in their forecast was 10,000 to 15,000 per annum, depending on assumptions made concerning the variables which I have mentioned. This is the source of the labour force projections. We used the upper bound of their estimate so as to highlight the maximum employment needs of the economy. If we [2534] had accepted the lower bound, we would have had 15,000 fewer jobs to create over the period of the plan. We took the upper bound in order to be sure we had the most comprehensive view possible of job creation needs. We did not have the results of the work of that group until after the White Paper on industrial policy had been finalised. That was a matter of some discussion earlier on in the House today. I turn now to a second group of criticisms concerning the public finance objectives in the plan. Here again the 'Tadhg an dá thaobh' syndrome has been rampant among the Opposition. In October 1982 Deputy Haughey stated that 'there is now widespread recognition of the need to limit the increasing cost to the Exchequer of the total amount of the public service pay bill if balance is to be restored to the public finances'—column 151, Official Report of 27 October 1982. Why is his view now different on both public sector pay and balance in the finances? Why did Deputy Ahern act as if he had never heard what Deputy Haughey said last October? In columns 151-152 of the Official Report of 27 October 1982 Deputy Haughey also said: We will, following this debate, present to the House the Estimates and the Public Capital Programme for 1983 which will give effect to the commitments made in the plan relating to the public finances. The 1983 Estimates published during the November 1982 General Election campaign were in many respects not underpinned by firm policy decisions. The present plan, in marked contrast, is based on decisions made as part of the preparation of the plan. I would refer the House to table 7-1 on page 136 of the plan where Members will see, set out by each departmental group, what the expenditure plans are for the period covered. Deputy Haughey also had some things to say in October 1982 about expenditure control upon which he seems to have turned his back in the meantime. In that [2535] regard the Government's track record is far better than that of any Fianna Fáil Government in recent years. What is the response of the Opposition to that? The Opposition when in power and publishing their own national plan quite rightly made a virtue of their attempts to control public expenditure. We are now getting the usual cant about monetarism, bookkeepers and other words like that. They are nothing more than a smoke-screen to obscure the fact that the Opposition have not the courage to make any other proposals or even to follow up the logic of their own proposals in 1982. Indeed, so bereft are the Opposition of constructive ideas that Deputy Reynolds was reduced to quoting from what he called 'an influential magazine, World Business'. Deputy Reynolds misquoted from the last paragraph and I think he fell into a trap which was unwittingly set for him by some kind of back room guru because there is no magazine of that name. I suspect he saw a photocopy of an article in The Economist of 6 October. It shows just how much checking Deputies on the opposite side have done if they base their comments on that kind of misreading of what I regard in that article as a fly piece of rushed writing by the Dublin correspondent who does not seem to have worried too much about facts but got a nice racy little article together. Deputy Haughey also selectively quoted from a speech made by my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, in October 1982. In quoting from Deputy Bruton's speech he missed the point of the criticism made at that time. Speaking about The Way Forward, in column 178 of the Official Report of 27 October 1982, Deputy Bruton said: What is wrong with the assumptions is not that they are too optimistic but that decisions are not taken in the plan to achieve them. As I have already stated, our plan is based on decisions. The results are clearly [2536] and unequivocally set out in the document in the tables on current expenditure, in the table on the capital programme and in the chapters that deal with the public finances and which set out clearly what we are doing, in so far as it is within the Government's power, to make sure that the budgetary, social, financial and employment targets are realised. This is a key consideration in the assessment of what the Opposition have said, both in opposition and in Government.

1555163,174,8,8,Committee on Finance. - Vote 48: Health (Resumed).,04/07/1972,Mr. Erskine Hamilton Childers,Fianna Fáil,Athlone-Longford,"Various Deputies mentioned the need for more hospital, county home, and mental hospital construction and so I should point out that in the list of schemes which have either been completed since 1971 or are at various stages of construction but in the case of all of which building can commence in either this or the next financial year, there are 62 schemes relating to general hospitals for additions, improvements or construction of one kind or another there are 36 schemes affecting accommodation of old age persons, 32 mental hospital schemes, 23 mentally handicapped schemes and 41 schemes for the improvement of accommodation of staff, mostly nurses. We are making some progress in providing better hospital facilities. Deputy Moore referred to the denigration of religious orders which is now a very popular form of sport in certain circles. We owe a great deal to the religious orders in our country for their help in hospital services, domiciliary services and in connection with the mentally handicapped. I regard as absolutely disastrous this attack on religious establishments by a great many people who should know better and who do not produce any alternative. I would suggest that anyone who wants to secularise everything overnight, as an ideal panacea for all ills, should go to certain countries where everything has been secularised. They can then come back and tell us if they like what they see. They can come back and argue it after they have been to the countries where everything has been duly secularised. Deputy Moore asked about the long term plan for federated hospitals and voluntary hospitals. The arrangements are in train to develop a great hospital at St. James to replace Sir Patrick Dun's, Baggot Street and Mercers Hospitals. It will take a very considerable time to accomplish all this and in the meantime it is hoped to provide certain medical facilities at St. James Hospital which are urgently needed. I do not think I need go into the question of the disposal of the property of St. Vincent's Hospital. All of this has been published in the newspapers. [608] By an agreement made with the late Donagh O'Malley the nuns were permitted to use for themselves the proceeds of the sale of some of the property and for the property at 96 Leeson Street they agreed that the funds should be handed back to the State. That is an arrangement which I intend to keep. I am afraid it is not possible for me to change the names of hospitals associated with cancer—I quite undestand what Deputy O'Connell meant —but neither can we afford to alter the position in relation to cancer patients and have all cancer patients treated in a great general hospital. Neither of those schemes is practical at the moment. Maternity hospital accommodation is under very active consideration. We have communicated with the masters of the maternity hospitals here and a programme is emerging. If the Deputies choose to read the census, they will find that it would have been difficult for the Central Statistics Office, in the light of the figures available between 1966 and 1969, to predict the upsurge of births which has taken place during the past three years. If they study the history of efforts to calculate the future population of England and Wales, they will find it an extraordinarily difficult task. We are now on to this problem and we will have the necessary maternity accommodation made available. Deputy Tully referred to the under-staffing of Cavan Surgical Hospital and the serious fire hazard there. The North Eastern Health Board have been endeavouring to find alternative accommodation for the patients and staff of the surgical hospital at Cavan where there is a fire hazard. The CEO is making arrangements to discontinue the use of the north wing comprising various numbers of beds and so forth. The intake of patients in this hospital is being relieved temporarily by referring County Cavan patients to the hospital at Navan or the County Hospital in Dundalk. The object is to reduce the fire hazard to which the Deputy referred. Deputy Burke asked when a college of nursing will be established. This is [609] being examined by An Bord Altranais, which is the body appropriate for this purpose. I have expressed the view that a college of nursing will be essential with special training in management. I am awaiting the report from An Bord Altranais on this matter. Deputy Byrne in a very long speech referred to the imbalance of beds between the north side and the south side of Dublin. While it is true that it is customary to think of the hospital development being in some way bounded on either side by the Liffey, I do not think that this is necessarily the best way of looking at the entire situation. The Liffey must not be regarded as a Berlin Wall or an Iron Curtain. It is spanned by numerous bridges and I do not think we could continue to make comparisons between hospital developments north and south of the Liffey. We want to make quite sure that there is a right kind of hospital development to suit the population generally in the various areas. Deputy Byrne claimed that tests of an emergency nature could not be done on Saturdays and Sundays because of the five-day week for laboratory technicians. This is actually not so. There are and there have been for a long time on call stand-by arrangements in operation for laboratory technicians and other key para-medical staff. When the stand-by requirements are needed, they can be put into force. Deputy Byrne made a long song and dance about St. Laurence's Hospital. All I can say is that the scheme of improvements in St. Laurence's Hospital, now in progress includes a new neuro-surgical theatre, a new X-ray department and ancillary accommodation, new lifts, an extension of the out-patients department, an extension of the nurses' home, electrical re-wiring and fire precaution measures and being planned is the replacement of the boiler plant and centralisation. I can say without fear of contradiction that St. Laurence's Hospital has received very ample capital assistance as a result of arrangements which have been sanctioned by me. Deputy Tully referred to patients [610] suffering a financial penalty by choosing their own hospitals. He should know that eligible patients are liable for no charges if they receive treatment in a public ward in a health board hospital or a hospital to which they are admitted with the approval of the health board. There is a choice within the range of health board hospitals and hospitals with which the health board has a deeming arrangement. There is, therefore, no question of a charge arising for an eligible patient unless he decides to be a private patient or goes of his own accord without the agreement of the health board to a hospital with which they do not operate a deeming arrangement. I understand that in the case of the North Eastern Health Board they were in respect of certain matters going to deem Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. The Deputy is a member of the board and it is a matter of a board decision. If certain people in the health board area have to pay if they go to the Lourdes Hos-pital——",04/07/1972,19,429,430,am afraid it is not possible for me to change the names of hospitals associated with cancer-I quite undestand what,Deputy O'Connell,meant but neither can we afford to alter the position in relation to cancer patients and have all cancer patients,Deputy O'Connell,1555163_3,,am afraid it is not possible for me to change the names of hospitals associated with cancer-I quite undestand what Deputy O'Connell meant but neither can we afford to alter the position in relation to cancer patients and have all cancer patients,am afraid it is not possible for me to change the names of hospitals associated with cancer-I quite undestand what meant but neither can we afford to alter the position in relation to cancer patients and have all cancer patients,text803,4,1,0,0,40,-0.075,-3,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,-0.722303649,-0.018057591,0.032032032,0.014014014,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.002002002,0.022022022,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4196075,2253,9,104,Adjournment Debate - Water Supply,25/05/2011,Mr. Ciaran Cannon,Fine Gael,Galway East,"I thank Deputy Lawlor, on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, for the opportunity to set out the current position on the provision of water infrastructure in north Kildare, with a particular emphasis on infrastructure which supports and encourages economic development in the area. Significant water services infrastructural development is taking place countrywide at present and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government’s water services investment programme 2010-12 is providing the funding to support this development. In addition to its public health, environmental compliance and water conservation focus, this programme has among its stated objectives the need to support economic and employment growth throughout the country. Exchequer funding of €435 million has been provided for the water services capital programme in 2011, with €350 million of this provision dedicated to the water services investment programme and the balance of €85 million allocated to the rural water programme. The water services investment programme comprises 130 contracts and water conservation projects which were in progress at the end of 2009, to the value of €1 billion 340 new contracts with an estimated value of €1. 8 billion, including around 80 water conservation contracts, with an estimated value of €321 million, that have been prioritised to start construction over the period 2010-2012 and 190 schemes and water conservation projects to be progressed through their earlier planning stages during 2010-2012. [391]In County Kildare alone, there are three contracts listed as at construction, and a further 14 are listed to start during the lifetime of the programme. The estimated cost of these contracts is just over €172 million. As part of the programme, the Barrow abstraction water supply scheme is one of the most significant projects being undertaken in the county. Although the contract for this scheme was signed only recently, when completed it will provide County Kildare with a new water treatment plant at Srowland, thereby reducing Kildare’s future demand on the Liffey system that serves the greater Dublin area. As part of the overall Kildare county water strategy, the Srowland water supply will enable Kildare County Council to become more self-reliant in respect of the supply of water in the county. A further element of that strategy, the Castlewarden-Ballygoran water pipeline and reservoir contract, recently approved to go to tender by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, will utilise water from Srowland and deliver it to Ballygoran in north Kildare. This contract, consisting of a new 20,000 cu m service reservoir at Ballygoran and over 17. 5 km of water main, will bring water to Barberstown Cross and the western area of Celbridge. The new reservoir will also supply water to the Maynooth, Celbridge, Leixlip and Straffan areas. Any requirements to meet the upgrading of facilities at Intel can be accommodated through a pipeline link from this supply to Intel and this can be completed within a very short time. The Minister is keenly aware of the existing economic and employment benefits of an enterprise such as Intel. The Deputy can be assured that his Department continues to work closely with Kildare County Council to advance the water supply, and other water services infrastructure requirements of the area.",25/05/2011,31,18,19,I thank Deputy Lawlor on behalf of the Minister for the Environment Community and Local Government Deputy,Phil Hogan,for the opportunity to set out the current position on the provision of water infrastructure in north Kildare with a,Phil Hogan,4196075_3,,I thank Deputy Lawlor on behalf of the Minister for the Environment Community and Local Government Deputy Phil Hogan for the opportunity to set out the current position on the provision of water infrastructure in north Kildare with a,I thank Deputy Lawlor on behalf of the Minister for the Environment Community and Local Government Deputy for the opportunity to set out the current position on the provision of water infrastructure in north Kildare with a,text30,0,3,0,0,37,0.081081081,3,1.945910149,0.052592166,0.180838886,0.004887537,0.930930931,0.908908909,0.937937938,0.921921922,0.727727728,0.695695696,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
880097,894,9,93,"Health Bill, 1954—Committee (Resumed).",15/07/1954,Mr. Michael Joseph O'Higgins,Fine Gael,Dublin South-West,"I was about to say to the Deputy that the Deputy is in effect asking me to exercise a power [1824] which I already possess. He is urging on me considerations which would be apt in relation to whatever departmental policy I might follow. His amendment, in so far as it seeks to give me this power, is an unnecessary amendment. I already have the power. I may refer Deputies to the relevant section of the main Act, that is, Section 22. Under the Act of 1953, no service could be provided by any health authority anywhere to anyone except in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister. If the Minister refrained from making any regulations, then no services at all could be provided. If the Minister refrained from making certain regulations then the services in respect of which regulations were not made could not be provided by any health authority anywhere. In fact, my predecessor made seven sets of regulations relating to many of the services set out in the Health Act. In relation to five of these services no practical difficulties have arisen. In relation to two of them practical difficulties have arisen. There are some services under the Act in respect of which at the moment regulations have not been made and, were that position continued, of course, no services could be provided. Under the regulation-making section, that is Section 22, the Minister is empowered to make regulations applicable to every health authority—that is in fact what has been done—or every health authority of a particular class. The Minister could, for instance, say: 'I will make regulations applicable to all rural areas. I will exclude Dublin City and Cork City, and so on.' That in fact has not been done but the power is there. Thirdly, the Minister is empowered to make regulations applicable to a particular health authority. The Minister is empowered to make regulations in relation to the County Roscommon only or, perhaps, the County Roscommon and some other counties only and the regulations shall deal with the manner in which and the extent to which they are to make available these services. [1825] So that, in fact, the power which the Deputy has urged that I should exercise is already exercisable by me. It is quite another matter as to whether I will exercise that power or not. That is a matter of policy and is not relevant to the discussion on this Bill. While, again, it is not strictly relevant to Deputy McQuillan's amendment, Deputy Briscoe referred to Section 2 of the Bill.",15/07/1954,15,424,425,is not relevant to the discussion on this Bill While again it is not strictly relevant to Deputy McQuillan's amendment,Deputy Briscoe,referred to Section 2 of the Bill,Deputy Briscoe,880097_1,,is not relevant to the discussion on this Bill While again it is not strictly relevant to Deputy McQuillan's amendment Deputy Briscoe referred to Section 2 of the Bill,is not relevant to the discussion on this Bill While again it is not strictly relevant to Deputy McQuillan's amendment referred to Section 2 of the Bill,text413,1,2,1,1,27,0.037037037,1,0.510825624,0.018919468,-0.274562589,-0.010168985,0.733733734,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.633633634,0.073073073,0.061061061,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3804823,1028,9,90,Child Care: Motion (Resumed).,14/11/2007,Mr. Alan Shatter,Fine Gael,Dublin South,"I thank my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party and other Opposition Members who spoke so eloquently in support of this motion. I am somewhat puzzled by the contributions of Fianna Fáil Members. It is a tradition in the House for Government Members to support their Minister in whatever he or she is doing. The tradition has somewhat changed in the past 24 hours. Apparently, most Fianna Fáil Members have grave concerns about the implications of the proposed child care scheme but they will support the Minister regardless. This is most unfortunate. This is not a motion of confidence in the Government. It is about genuine concerns about the implications of the proposed scheme for not-for-profit child care facilities and the impact it will have on parents and children. I would like to see those Members of Fianna Fáil who had the courage to express their concerns to have the [1195]same courage when voting on the motion. This is a parliament, not a theatre. We should vote on what we believe and not just play political games in the Chamber. We need more, not fewer, affordable child-centred child care services. I recognise the Government has put up to €300 million in funding for the provision of good not-for-profit child care facilities. People in communities across the State have volunteered their time and made great efforts to provide the type of child care facilities that were badly needed for a long time. This was done not just to facilitate children but to facilitate mothers trying to get back into the workforce. It assisted young families under financial pressure to maintain two incomes. It was not just a back-to-work scheme but one that facilitated those in low-income groups to remain in the workforce. The new scheme announced by the Government will pull the rug from under their feet. The consistent approach over recent years to not-for-profit child care facilities was supported on all sides of the House. The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, claims the proposed scheme will provide child care subventions for those in receipt of social welfare benefits or those in employment in receipt of family income supplement. On all sides of the House, it is recognised the scheme must also make provision for those in the workforce in receipt of low incomes who do not fall within eligibility criteria for family income supplement. The proposed scheme is to become operational on 1 July 2008 with a transitional arrangement to maintain the current scheme. The Government has also promised to do something but it still does not know exactly what. It hopes those running not-for-profit child care services will maintain existing services. However, not one Member on the Government side can say what steps will be taken to ensure this. The motion calls for certainty in this sector for the next 12 months. The Government must maintain the current scheme until 31 December 2008 and examine the data it will collect. It is an extra[1196]ordinary approach for the Government to announce a new scheme without knowing how it will impact and then to claim it will research it afterwards. It also claims that when the research is completed it will work out how and when it will change the scheme. Not-for-profit child care services which need to recruit new staff cannot give any security of contract or inform prospective employees if they will be employed from 1 July 2008. The Minister claims there was misinformation from this side of the House. There has been no misinformation on this side of the House. The Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, referred to regional seminars. The Department’s regional seminars highlighted the inadequacies of the scheme and caused alarm bells to ring in the heads of those across the country who have provided these services. We have not criticised the financial allocation for child care services. The Minister of State has been slaying dragons that do not exist by accusing people of criticising the level of funding available from his Department. We are criticising the new scheme which will not allow for the proper expenditure of that funding and will leave far too many families under financial pressure. The detail of the scheme threatens the future functioning of facilities that work well, the employment of the staff in them and creates real worries for parents, particularly women, about their capacity to remain in employment. I predict that if the House does not vote to extend the scheme to December 2008 it will prove impossible to collate the significant information being furnished to the Department by over 800 child care facilities and tens of thousands of parents, and to work out what the changes should be. It is likely that although the Government will reject this motion the current scheme may have to continue to the end of the year. Would it not be better to do this by agreement on all sides of the House than to allow the uncertainty continue for several months? I urge the House to support the motion. Amendment put.

2355193,300,23,86,"Social Welfare Bill, 1988: Committee Stage (Resumed).",23/03/1988,Mr. Proinsias De Rossa,Sinn Féin the Workers' Party,Dublin North-West,"I have a few points to make on this topic, some of which have already been covered by Deputy Bell. It is important to view this from the point of view of the pressure at present imposed on the health boards in respect of community care. The very niggardly allowance given to pensioners and the incapacitated to support those who are caring for them in the home is contradictory in the light of pressure on community care. The Minister for Health in his speech on the budget emphasised that health boards should ensure, under their budgets — cut back as they are — an attempt to develop community care facilities. If nobody is available to care for the elderly and the incapacitated in [754] the home, then the whole basis of community care collapses. It is important, therefore, that adequate income be provided for those who make a decision to care for their parents or relatives who may be incapacitated. For that reason, there is need to look at this matter a little more closely. The second aspect is that for a variety of reasons the majority of people who are prescribed relatives are women. We know, as has been mentioned on numerous occasions, the extent to which women are discriminated against in our society. To expect them, on the one hand, to take on the burden of caring for the elderly or incapacitated relatives and, on the other, to deny them an adequate income which would leave them with some dignity is wrong. We should do whatever we can to eliminate that. The Minister mentioned that the recommendation from the Commission on Social Welfare was to provide for a unified social system scheme and that the prescribed relative scheme should be abolished and the person who would normally be the prescribed relative should qualify in his or her own right for social assistance. That would be a sensible way to approach the matter. Does the Minister intend to go in that direction? Can he indicate how soon he expects such a reform of the system will be introduced? Certainly, as long as I have been in this House the question of the prescribed relative's allowance has been raised on every occasion on which there has been a debate on social welfare. It is time we took the problem in hand to see how it can be remedied. One of the strongest points made to me with regard to the prescribed relative's allowance is the fact that it is not paid to the person who does the caring. Such people feel very sore about that, that because they take on that job they are then deprived of applying in their own right for assistance. Some get a supplementary welfare allowance but in some cases it is very little. That is not an adequate response to the problem. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is intended as a safety net, to [755] ensure that people who get into difficulties on a temporary basis can be assisted. It is not satisfactory to expect a person who is not only doing his or her relatives a service, but also the community, to live in this way without rights in relation to income.",23/03/1988,25,19,20,I have a few points to make on this topic some of which have already been covered by,Deputy Bell,It is important to view this from the point of view of the pressure at present imposed on the health,Deputy Bell,2355193_1,,I have a few points to make on this topic some of which have already been covered by Deputy Bell It is important to view this from the point of view of the pressure at present imposed on the health,I have a few points to make on this topic some of which have already been covered by It is important to view this from the point of view of the pressure at present imposed on the health,text209,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,0,-0.048666426,-0.001280695,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.281281281,0.283283283,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One could then argue there is no legal problem because the developers who had loans with banks X, Y and Z still have the loans with those banks. The legal relationship between the borrower and the lender would not be [523]changed in any way and could not be challenged. There is good property expertise in the banking system and it could evaluate the real and potential value of such loans. It could address the questions of which loans to form and the capacity to repay. Certain loans could then be isolated and put to one side. The problem the Labour Party has with the NAMA proposal is in the detail rather than the concept. We all recognise there must be a transfer of the toxic debt out of the way to provide for the resumption of normal, healthy banking. On that matter the House, including Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour, is agreed. How much will this cost? The NAMA proposal is not costed. If one paid one third of the book value of loans one would assume or would be obliged to transfer in some shape or form €30 billion.

2218519,1549,9,157,"National Development Corporation Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).",30/10/1985,Mr. Liam (William) Anthony Naughten,Fine Gael,Roscommon,"I am pleased to welcome this Bill which I consider to be a new exciting initiative on the job creation front, of vital importance to our future industrial development. It has been contended that this is a political Bill, that it is a brainchild of the Labour Party. I am not worried about whether it is political or was first thought up by the Labour Party. Rather am I concerned that its provisions will provide major employment opportunities for many of our young unemployed, which I believe they will. In the past there have been industrialists with excellent projects they could not get off the ground. They could not create the jobs that this new corporation could develop simply because they were unable to obtain the necessary financial capital. In that regard I believe the provisions of this Bill will play a major role with both private and semi-State involvement. The House should recognise the advantages and opportunities presented under the provisions of this Bill. Many industries at present importing commodities that could be produced on the domestic market will discover that such can be produced as a result of this Bill. Prior to its introduction this Bill attracted some unwarranted and singularly non-constructive criticism on the part of the Leader of Fianna Fáil. It was evident that very little thought was given to those remarks. I very much regret that he did not await its introduction. Let us not forget that, when the Industrial Development Authority were being established by a former Coalition Government in 1949, Fianna Fáil had the same remarks to make about that Authority then as they have now about the National Development Corporation. [793] We are all aware what a tremendous success the IDA have proved to be. I sincerely hope that, in time, the National Development Corporation will prove to be as satisfactory. Arising from those comments by the Leader of Fianna Fáil and other Fianna Fáil speakers there has been put out a false impression of the objectives of this Bill. I might reiterate some points made by the Minister on its introduction. First, the National Development Corporation will not be giving grants but engaging in equity investment on which they will be seeking to make a profit. It is only proper that profits should be sought from such investment. I might point out that they were not designed to undertake the functions of a rescue agency, again something which I believe to be right and proper. Neither do I believe there will be any conflict whatsoever between the National Development Corporation and the Industrial Development Authority. I know the Minister will ensure that there will be an operating agreement drawn up between the two bodies, which will be subject to Ministerial approval. By operating on a commercial entity basis, the National Development Corporation will provide an opportunity for useful State investment, the establishment of new enterprises and, unlike the IDA, will be able to dispose of them in accordance with normal commercial criteria. They can invest in a project which, if successful, can be disposed of in the normal commercial manner. I believe that policy to be correct, that if a project is got off the ground, is self-financing, then the funds arising therefrom should be utilised for further financial investment. The National Development Corporation can be involved in the development of highly value-added investment to be used as a vital industrial base. They can play a major role in the development of our natural resources, much of which did not receive the type of investment or high priority they should have received in the past. Employment objectives can be achieved only by way of selective investment. When it comes to valuable resources we [794] should be careful how we invest, for example, in what type of projects. At a time of scarce national resources it is important that, in the long term, identifiable projects are viable ones. It is not unreasonable to expect that the corporation will invest in projects which will take some time to mature. It is right and proper that we should invest in them. Unlike private industry, it may not be practical for the corporation to get involved since they might have to wait a considerable time to get a return on their investment. Resources should not be tied up indefinitely in technology of the mid-eighties and the National Development Corporation should, due to their revolving investment fund, be in a position to stay on the frontiers of technology and provide the jobs required for our young population. It is important that the corporation should be able to sell their assets and reinvest in new technology because we must keep abreast of new technology, new products and processes. In the past, many firms ran into financial difficulties as a result of heavy borrowing. In this connection the National Development Corporation can play a major role by becoming involved with private industry and providing the necessary financial capital and loans. The Government are committed, in conjunction with sectoral and agricultural interests, to a co-ordinated development programme for indigenous resources. To expand on this point I wish to draw on one or two examples from my own area. In County Roscommon indigenous industries of a servicing nature for farm products have proved commercially viable and lead one to suggest that the potential of indigenous industries in many rural areas, such as farm land, rivers and other natural resources, have remained largely untapped. The National Development Corporation can play a major role in the development of rural Ireland. Industries in my area which are based on indigenous resources include Hanley's of Roosky, North Connacht Farmers, Connacht [795] Meats and the Shannonside Development in Ballaghaderreen. These are all extremely successful industries but we still have not come to grips with getting the maximum value for our agricultural products. Far too often in the past we were selling a commodity which did not give the best possible returns. I can think of many areas in agriculture where many jobs could be created but, unfortunately, these have not been fully tapped. By comparison with indigenous industries based on agriculture, very often multinational companies employ fairly large numbers of people. However, these companies have a tendency to take the easy option on occasions when faced with difficult trading circumstances. Examples of this can be found all over the west in urban areas such as Roscommon, Castlebar and Sligo which have all suffered over the last few years. One can also question the method of assessing job potential in the context of financial investment and huge moneys by the IDA. The National Development Corporation have as their principal objective the creation of the maximum number of viable jobs as a result of their investment. Under the legislation, the National Development Corporation are required to act commercially, which is welcome and I compliment the Minister and the Government for ensuring that this is part and parcel of the Bill. We must also consider our fisheries and forest resources. In recent weeks forestry was the subject of much comment and I am not unduly concerned whether our forestry development is carried out by the State or by private interests. For far too long we have failed to recognise the tremendous potential and opportunities which lie in the forestry industry, such as job creation, developing the industry and preventing imports of timber. In many cases we export timber which is wasteful and a misuse of a vital natural resource. I also believe that the National Development Corporation can play a major role in developing our fishing industry. In that context one cannot help but notice the lack of impact any such development [796] is making in the media at present compared to ten years ago when EC regulations were being discussed and we had very lengthy debates as to how this industry could best be utilised. Much of the development has been piecemeal and I hope that the National Development Corporation will bring about a more uniform approach. We are an island situated in the midst of some of the richest fishing grounds in the world and it will be our own fault if we continue to allow other nations to capitalise on what is effectively one of our greatest natural resources. Unfortunately we have not taken advantage of this natural resource. We have not developed it or created the opportunities for jobs in the processing of fish. This is an area in which the National Development Corporation can play a major role, together with private investment, in bringing in modern techniques to develop the fishing industry and creating the maximum number of jobs. The National Development Corporation can also play a major role in tourism as we have only touched the tip of the iceberg in this regard. We have neglected this vital source of revenue and tourism received scant attention and small financial resources in the past. I regret that many of our lakes and waterways are totally under developed. Development associations and other bodies, such as county councils, have received small financial allocations to provide amenities and to carry out other improvements. I should like to see the National Development Corporation getting involved in the development and provision of much needed facilities in the tourist industry. In the midlands the MRDO, an organisation involving five adjoining counties, have set up a sub-committee to develop Lough Rea. It is regrettable that such a major tourist asset has not been developed. Whatever work that has been done has been carried out by one or two private companies. Here the NDC can play a major role in the co-ordinated development of the entire Shannon to exploit the tremendous tourist potential of that region. I should like to see the corporation invest in that area. [797] The accusation is often made that there are many bureaucrats running the country. Frequently we say that State companies are overloaded with civil servants. I hope that will not happen with the NDC. I am glad to see that they will have a nine member board and I hope that those appointed to the board will have the ability to develop the NDC to the maximum so that the greatest number of jobs possible may be created for our young people. The announcement by the Minister last Wednesday, together with the announcement by the Taoiseach of other employment incentives, will help to create many vital jobs. Those measures together with the social employment scheme and other schemes of the Department of Labour in the next 12 months will play a major role in reducing the number of unemployed. I welcome the introduction of this Bill and I compliment the Minister. I am confident the NDC will be an important vehicle for employment in the years ahead.",30/10/1985,24,318,319,in time the National Development Corporation will prove to be as satisfactory Arising from those comments by the Leader of,Fianna Fáil,and other Fianna Fáil speakers there has been put out a false impression of the objectives of this Bill I,Fianna Fáil,2218519_3,,in time the National Development Corporation will prove to be as satisfactory Arising from those comments by the Leader of Fianna Fáil and other Fianna Fáil speakers there has been put out a false impression of the objectives of this Bill I,in time the National Development Corporation will prove to be as satisfactory Arising from those comments by the Leader of and other Fianna Fáil speakers there has been put out a false impression of the objectives of this Bill I,text549,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.140556386,0.00351391,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.660660661,0.626626627,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3334768,974,9,164,"National Tourism Development Authority Bill, 2002 [ Seanad ] : Second Stage (Resumed).",12/02/2003,Mr. John Perry,Fine Gael,Sligo-Leitrim,"This is a very important debate. CERT has served this country very well since its formation in 1963. The staff trained by CERT have done outstanding work. The formation of the National Tourism Development Authority to promote and develop tourism facilities and services is very important. The promotion of tourism and the success of CERT in providing a céad míle fáilte has done a lot for tourism in the past. The great difficulty for the tourism industry in the future will be the retention of staff. Recently a huge number of work permits have been granted. If one were to study the number of work permits issued in the past two years, one would find that a high proportion of them were issued to chefs and other specialised staff. I know from speaking with people in the trade that there is a huge problem trying to retain staff. There is also a problem in regard to high expectations and salaries. The stacked up costs involved in running tourism outlets such as restaurants or hotels are huge. A high value added tax is incorporated into the prices and staff must work unsociable hours, including weekends. The high cost of employing chefs is a huge difficulty for a number of people in the trade. We are all aware of what has been happening in the Minister's constituency in the past year. However, what is needed for the promotion of tourism is that regional tourism offices should create new attractions and new hubs. Most tourists visit six or eight destinations. We must develop the island of Ireland as a tourism destination, which would result in repeat business. If people come to a small economy based country, travel around the Ring of Kerry, visit Clonmacnoise and kiss the Blarney Stone, the tendency is not to go back. It is important to develop repeat business, which is the most profitable business of all. We have failed in creating new destinations. Deputy Enright referred to promoting festivals during the summer. This is a generic tourism market which is very easy to grow. We must tap into community resources by involving the Leader partnership, local county councils and the critical mass of people to promote the county tourism plan. Sometimes a lot of money is spent in formulating plans but very little happens. As someone who comes from a Border county, I believe a great deal of work can be done in relation to the promotion of cross-Border tourism. I was very disappointed recently that the money voted for in the Estimate for INTERREG and cross-Border funding did not get approval from Europe. I was very surprised because a huge amount of money drawn down under the Department of Finance Estimate was not spent. The all-Ireland tourism body promotes Ireland as a tourism destination to people who come to Dublin, [478] Belfast or the Border counties. We should promote Northern Ireland tourism to people from southern Ireland who have not gone on holiday to Northern Ireland. We are talking about promoting Ireland in North America but our biggest tourism market is the European market, particularly the UK market. The low cost airlines are very important, therefore we should focus on the UK market. I am very disappointed that Ryanair will not set up a hub in Shannon or the west to bring people to the west coast. There is a possibility of a second terminal in Dublin. There are huge facilities at Shannon Airport or Knock Airport which could easily accommodate a low fare airline like Ryanair. I am disappointed in regard to the development of regional airports which is crucial to bringing people into the regions. The new body will help to market Ireland. It will provide competent staff to deal with people coming to Ireland. We have lost much of the céad míle fáilte element. The perception of parents of the trade is very different nowadays. The tourism industry is seen as just a summer job. CERT should market the industry in the schools through career guidance teachers. Parents think it is fine for their sons or daughters to work in a pub or restaurant at weekends but, unfortunately, they do not see the industry as a very worthwhile career. People do not want to work in the hotel industry, including medium-sized hotels or small restaurants, while they will work in five star hotel chains. There are good examples of people in this country who have been very successful. They have chains of hotels in the United States and the UK. These people have been Ireland's greatest ambassadors and have done outstanding work. I compliment all those hoteliers who have taken huge risks. Running a business today needs a great level of investment on which there is not always a good return. As Deputy Enright said, high insurance costs are a big problem. The cost of public liability is huge. People see the possibility of making an insurance claim as the closest thing to winning the lotto. They feel they are guaranteed money if they have a simple slip or fall. Some people have had to install CCTV systems to verify the truth of claims. Tourism is now Ireland's greatest industry. We need to continue to promote holidays on this island and the islands off its coast. Many people spend a great deal of money to leave this country to go on holidays each year. The fact that the Irish market is quiet is borne out by newspaper advertisements for three midweek nights in a hotel for €100. There is great pressure to fill accommodation. I am delighted that the purpose of this Bill is to amalgamate Bord Fáilte and CERT. It is important that the role of CERT, which will be modified as a result of this Bill, is supported, perhaps by acknowledging that qualifications acquired through CERT are as worthy of recognition as those acquired through institutes of technology. Those who are trained within the industry, perhaps to be a bartender or a head [479] waitress, should be able to communicate with customers. Ireland's greatest asset is the friendliness of its people, but I have heard from a number of sources that people in the service industries often seem tired and do not seem to have a high level of dedication. This is not always the case, especially among those who are pursuing their jobs as a long-term career. The Minister has a tranche of funds to spend creating new destinations in the BMW region, which includes County Sligo. We have to ensure that there are new and attractive destinations, such as the Border region, for tourists coming to this country. I appreciate that we may be reinventing the wheel to an extent, but we have to market new destinations so that people returning to Ireland will be able to go to new places. An example of such a destination in the north-west is the Carrowkeel megalithic tomb in County Sligo, which is comparable to Newgrange. It has not been marketed, unfortunately.

925996,318,9,152,Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 10—General (Resumed).,16/05/1956,Mr. James M. Dillon,Fine Gael,Monaghan,"——and doubtless he will then be saying in 1986 what he was saying in 1928 when the Budget was £26,000,000. At column 1101 of Volume 34 of the Official Report, Deputy MacEntee said:— 'After such a recital, people may well ask what they have to hope for from this Government. The price of butter may go down. The farmers may be beggared and impoverished, but the giddy whirl of governmental extravagance must go on and taxation, so long as the Minister remains in office, remains at its present high level. The Minister's speech was a confession, not only of material but of mental and moral poverty. As previously, the Minister refused to face up to the facts and to set them plainly and truthfully before the people.' Oh, no. Deputy MacEntee is right in the same old groove that he was in 30 golden years ago and his gloomy prophecies of 1956 are just as likely to be fulfilled as were his gloomy prophecies in 1928. Now, the plain truth is that Fianna Fáil is hoping and praying that some unforeseen disaster will overtake this country so that they may be justified in all their gloomy prophecies.

3121037,464,26,99,"Private Members' Business. - Electoral (Amendment) (Donations to Parties and Candidates) Bill, 2000: Second Stage.",16/05/2000,Mr. Eamon Gilmore,The Workers' Party,Dún Laoghaire,"Sooner or later this Labour Party proposal to ban corporate donations to political parties and politicians will become law and this House will pass the legislation proposed by the party. It will do so because the tide has already turned on the corporate funding of politics, and because already, even in Fianna Fáil, which opposes the measure, Members such as Deputy Fleming and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, have spotted the change. Even the Government amendment acknowledges that the House must pass legislation and the Government is postponing the evil day. The sooner the House passes this legislation the better for politics. This Bill, which the Labour Party signalled as far back as its annual conference more than a year ago, is being debated against the bleak backdrop of property interests corrupting public decision making by bribing the votes and decisions of elected and appointed public servants. Even if there was no suggestion of corruption, the time to break the financial link between business and politics is long overdue. Contrary to what some commentators would have us believe, the corporate funding of political parties and political campaigns is not the third secret of Fatima. It has been well known that some companies were paying political contributions to parties and individual campaigns over a long period and until recently these were generally regarded, as Mr. Justice Hamilton famously put it in the beef tribunal report, as 'normal political donations'. The practice should be ended because the corporate funding of the political [287] process has, at the very least, distorted political competition. Until the enactment of the Electoral Bill, 1997, which was introduced in the Oireachtas by Deputy Howlin, there was no limit to what a party or a candidate could spend in an election campaign. While the level of election spending and votes received did not positively correlate in each case, it is clear that the parties with the greatest financial resources got the highest number of seats in elections. It was always difficult, and sometimes impossible, for a candidate or party with limited resources to compete with the expensive advertising and professional campaigning of the larger party, with its corporate funded war chest. A candidate or a party might have a worthy message or set of policies at election time, but how were they expected to communicate them effectively to the electorate during the three weeks of an election campaign? Money enabled candidates and parties to talk at election time and those whose messages were heard best were those who could afford the costs of communicating. The corporate funding of political parties significantly influenced the outcome of elections and the formation of Governments. If the first distortion of politics caused by corporate funding related to elections, the second relates to policy and ideology. It is not an accident that the parties which have received and still receive the overwhelming bulk of corporate funding are those which are generally perceived to be pro-business. In a way, the corporate funding of the more conservative parties in this State has been itself the justification for trade union funding – limited though it is – of the Labour Party. As a former trade union official, I recall debates at union conferences about the establishment and existence of a political fund. Put very simply, the argument was that if employers were going to promote their collective economic interests by funding political parties, workers also needed to have a political arm to which the trade unions contributed. It is not surprising that this country is unique in Europe in that we have never had a Labour-led Government and that traditionally the Labour Party and its allies on the left have been the third force in Irish politics, behind Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. This aspect of the country's political history is not unrelated to the fact that the Labour Party has always had to contest elections against uneven odds and never had the same financial resources for organisation or electioneering as the two larger parties. Neither is it an accident that the dominant ideological consensus has been that whatever was good for business was good for the country. The third distortion of politics to which corporate funding has contributed is the decline in public confidence in our democracy, and it is the most worrying. What began as a tangible declaration of class allegiance, or perhaps a sense of duty to [288] fund politics generally, has, it appears, in some cases, degenerated into a straight corrupt trading of votes for money. To restore confidence in politics we need to end the corporate funding of political parties. The days of corporate funding of political parties are probably numbered anyway. Huge and welcome changes are beginning to overtake the traditional relationship between citizens and the representatives they elect to local authorities and to parliament. Information and communication are the oxygen and life-blood of politics. Up to now, communication between the politician and the citizen has been mediated through the mass media and advertising. The communication of political messages has become an expensive business requiring political parties and politicians to compete not only with each other but also with the whole consumer array available to the public. Policies, serious political discussion, and the exchange and debate of ideas must give way to the sound-bite, the advertised image and the spin. Marketing has become the centre of political activity and it is expensive. To date it has been paid for in the main by contributions from the corporate sector. The signs are, however, that it is changing. New information and communication technology makes it possible for the citizen and the public representative to communicate with each other directly without the need for expensive advertising. That, coupled with the limits that have already been placed on election spending, will reduce the need for big campaigning war chests. That is not to say money will not be required by political parties – of course it will, to fund research, develop policies and staff the new kind of communication cycle. The Labour Party believes this should now be done primarily through funding from the State. If we value our democracy we must fund it from public funds and in a way that is open and accountable. We also have to ensure that the individual citizen retains the right to contribute to political causes, including political parties. That in itself is a fundamental aspect of the right to organise. The Bill confines the right to contribute to political parties to those who are entitled to register to vote. It, therefore, excludes corporate funding. It also excludes funding from outside the State. This is an important aspect of the Bill. How and by whom we are governed is a matter for the voters of the country and nobody else. That is what we call self-determination. There have been well documented stories of some political parties and single-issue campaigns seeking and raising significant sums of money, in the United States for example, for the purpose of influencing politics in this State. That should no longer be permitted. Lobbies of what ever kind in the United States or in any other country, have no right to buy political influence in this State either by funding political parties, individual candidates or single-issue campaigns. The Bill would prohibit that activity for the future. [289] I wish to refer to the proposed Government amendment. Like so much that we get from Fianna Fáil, the amendment is for everything, against nothing and proposes to do nothing about either. The amendment proposes to postpone consideration of Second Stage of the Bill until 1 December this year, which incidentally is a Friday and, therefore, not a sitting day. That is not the only evidence of Fianna Fáil's cynicism in this amendment, however. If what is being proposed in the legislation is not being opposed directly by the Government then why is it being postponed?",16/05/2000,28,629,630,Labour Party and its allies on the left have been the third force in Irish politics behind Fianna Fáil and,Fine Gael,This aspect of the country's political history is not unrelated to the fact that the Labour Party has always had,Fine Gael,3121037_5,,Labour Party and its allies on the left have been the third force in Irish politics behind Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael This aspect of the country's political history is not unrelated to the fact that the Labour Party has always had,Labour Party and its allies on the left have been the third force in Irish politics behind Fianna Fáil and This aspect of the country's political history is not unrelated to the fact that the Labour Party has always had,text228,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.054660817,-0.00136652,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.274274274,0.28028028,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
972429,968,9,112,Committee on Finance. - Vote 61—Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.,13/05/1958,Mr. Patrick W. Palmer,Fine Gael,Kerry South,"People must accept their responsibilities. If increases are given in social services, it means extra taxation on drink, cigarettes, petrol and so on. Old age pensioners and [116] persons in receipt of social benefits should remember that if they get an increase of 2/6 per week, they would lose in other ways, in buying a few drinks or tobacco. Our social services compare very favourably with the social services in any other country that we know of, and we can claim that they are better in many cases. Every Deputy knows that there are many special cases where an old age pensioner or blind pensioner may have no means but the pension. That applies also to certain widows and orphans. Some means should be devised whereby such persons could get something over and above the amounts given to persons living in their own homes who have members of the family or relatives to help them. In the cities and towns especially, there are such very needy cases. I know that there would be a difficulty in doing that. I am not sure if the local authority in such cases can provide extra benefits. That perhaps would be the only way in which something extra could be given, because the home assistance officers could investigate means and make the necessary recommendations. People should be very slow to ask for any increases in the social services as at present fixed, unless they are prepared to accept higher taxation, and saturation point has been reached in that regard. As regards the unemployed and unemployment assistance, we have often heard people state that perhaps a quarter of those on the register as unemployed would be unemployable and nobody would give them work. I do not know how far that is true, but certainly there must be a fairly large number. If they are unemployable or incapable of work they must get some benefits and the benefits that such people receive by way of unemployment assistance are not sufficient to keep body and soul together. However, there are, I am sure, a number of people in receipt of unemployment assistance who are not really deserving of it. People who are pretty well off have been knows to draw unemployment assistance, commonly called the dole. That may be regarded as one of the frauds referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary and, if such frauds [117] exist, it is only right that these cases should be not strictly examined. If such people were not drawing benefits of that kind to which they are not legally entitled, there would perhaps be such a sum left over as could be devoted to increasing the benefits for those who are genuinely unemployed and genuinely looking for work. If anybody is entitled to generous benefits, it is those who, through no fault of their own, cannot find employment in this country and who are genuinely seeking it. As Deputy Corish stated, a vast sum of money is being provided under this Vote, but I am sure it is all quite necessary. Even if there are some people receiving benefits to which they are not entitled under the three sections of this Vote, I am sure the amount would not be very much when compared with the total of over £25,000,000. Still it is only right that the Department should so carry out the administration that there will be no frauds. Let us hope that when the financial situation allows, this House will make even better provision for those who are entitled to those benefits. Increases have been given during the past eight or ten years, but they are not at all sufficient to keep up with the increase in the cost of living. I suppose we have to understand that the benefits given through these social services were never meant to enable people to live in any kind of comfort, but only as a help. Even at that, let us hope that at some future time we shall be in the happy position of being able to increase the benefits to those who deserve them.",13/05/1958,16,489,490,who through no fault of their own cannot find employment in this country and who are genuinely seeking it As,Deputy Corish,stated a vast sum of money is being provided under this Vote but I am sure it is all quite,Deputy Corish,972429_1,,who through no fault of their own cannot find employment in this country and who are genuinely seeking it As Deputy Corish stated a vast sum of money is being provided under this Vote but I am sure it is all quite,who through no fault of their own cannot find employment in this country and who are genuinely seeking it As stated a vast sum of money is being provided under this Vote but I am sure it is all quite,text534,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.376311042,0.009407776,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.916916917,0.866866867,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1124960,652,8,30,"Committee on Finance. - Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill, 1962—Second Stage (Resumed).",31/01/1963,Mr. Jack Lynch,Fianna Fáil,Cork Borough,"I am talking about industrial grants generally. Deputy Donegan came into the House the night before last and said that 1956 was the first time that industrial grants were given in this country. I tried to correct him but he literally shouted me down. He did not want to hear the truth and I want to record it now. The year 1952 saw the passing of the Undeveloped Areas Act and the 1956 Act was perhaps a natural consequence of applying limited grants to the rest of the country. Both of these have continued in existence since then. They have been amended and extended as occasion demanded and as practice dictated. Deputy Donegan also suggested that nothing was done to ease the strictures of the Control of Manufactures Acts of 1932 and 1934 until, he said himself, the tax concessions on [761] exports, or profits derived from new exports, were given by Deputy Sweetman when he was Minister for Finance. That was not in any way an easement of whatever strictures were involved in the Control of Manufactures Acts but the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Act, passed in 1958, was, and many of the new exporting firms with foreign participation have been operating here under that 1958 Act which facilitated their coming in. As long as they export, taking one year with another, 90 per cent. of each of their products then the Control of Manufactures Act does not apply to them. I know that most Deputies know all about this but when you hear a Deputy like Deputy Donegan, who sits on the Fine Gael Front Bench, making these statements and asserting them as facts, one wonders whether it is brash politics or whether it is his belief. In any event, it is better to have these things put on record. Both Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish suggested that nothing was being done about the adaptation of industry for freer trade conditions. Deputy Corish said that there was no evidence that the Government are doing anything to encourage private industry to fit themselves for freer trade conditions.",31/01/1963,17,326,327,Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish suggested that nothing was being done about the adaptation of industry for freer trade conditions,Deputy Corish,said that there was no evidence that the Government are doing anything to encourage private industry to fit themselves for,Deputy Corish,1124960_8,,Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish suggested that nothing was being done about the adaptation of industry for freer trade conditions Deputy Corish said that there was no evidence that the Government are doing anything to encourage private industry to fit themselves for,Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish suggested that nothing was being done about the adaptation of industry for freer trade conditions said that there was no evidence that the Government are doing anything to encourage private industry to fit themselves for,text760,0,3,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.945910149,0.048647754,0.260887907,0.006522198,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.937937938,0.884884885,0.831831832,0.778778779,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
814499,101,8,90,"Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance) Bill, 1952—Second Stage (Resumed).",04/12/1952,Mr. Robert Briscoe,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South,"I am making a good case for a changing of Government and I hope it will be perpetuated. Could you not imagine, Sir, how many days we would have spent on investigation about that transaction, how many motions would have been put down, possibly tribunals set up to investigate why and how? And now we are told, notwithstanding that transaction, that Deputy MacEntee went across to the Chancellor of the British Exchequer, Mr. Butler, to take instructions from him on how to frame our Budget. Is it not obvious that in framing the Budget the Minister has to do it in conformity with the conditions existing and with the results he hopes to bring about and is it not also clear that what Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance wanted to accomplish was a closing of the gap in our balance of payments in order that our reserves invested abroad, whatever they may be— £300,000,000 or £400,000,000—shall remain as reserves? Before I conclude, may I give the Dáil my authority, which I am sure they will agree with, for believing that is a good thing to do? I read the other night in the House Deputy Costello's reference to this matter in 1948 and I am not going to bore the House with it now. But I am sure Deputy Hickey will accept this as authoritative. Speaking in the Seanad on July 29th, 1948, Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, said at column 546, Volume 35, of the Official Reports:— 'We are living beyond our means as far as the difference between the balance of payments shows and, unless we can correct that, we will soon come to the point where these reserves will be dissipated and weakened to the point that they [696] will not give us the old reserve. In that position, two things have to be done. We will have to make a tremendous effort to get extra exports from the country or else we definitely lower our standard of living in so far as that depends upon these importations.' Again in his Budget speech, May 2nd, 1951, speaking at column 1884, Volume 125, of the Dáil Report, Deputy McGilligan said:— 'Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way. The implication is obvious. We cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.' While he was Minister, Deputy McGilligan, addressing the north city constituency of Fine Gael, was reported in the Irish Press of October 25th, 1949, as follows:— 'Even though they could now achieve the object of closing the gap immediately, it could not be postponed for longer than half-way through 1951.' Then, speaking in Dáil Éireann on October 15th, 1947, as reported in Volume 108, column 427, Deputy McGilligan said:— 'We will reach the happy condition then in which we will have nothing more to play with and in which we will have to turn attention to the home front.' That meant that the external resources would have been gone. Obviously we must not dissipate those funds, those assets, that wealth of our people. We must recognise that the real wealth of this nation is what we can save over and above what is needed from year to year. Out of the productivity comes the saving. Out of the saving wealth is created and, if that is going to be of any value at all, out of that wealth some advantage must accrue to the people who create it. They must get something for it. They must get the benefit of their thrift in the shape of an income. [697] If a person has too much money invested and his income is consequently very high, instead of reducing the rate of interest that he gets we tax him. From the other side of the House taxation has been referred to as a bludgeoning attitude of the Government. So that, Fine Gael, if they ever get back and lead the Coalition group again, are going to reduce taxation they are going to reduce the cost of living or, if they are not going to reduce the cost of living, they are going to increase wages so that the increased cost of living will not be felt and they are going to reduce incomes as well. It is a very simple proposition I think you can do it by algebra: If X produces Y, you get so much, and if you put your values on your Xs and Ys and reduce them, what will be the final result? How is a person to get food, clothing and shelter if the means to get them are destroyed, if the means to produce them are destroyed? That is what Fine Gael are talking about now. They talked about our attitude when we were speaking on the Vote for Supplies and Services when we were in opposition, but Deputy Collins cannot remember the facts. Pre-1948, Fine Gael, and Clann na Poblachta in particular, promised, if returned to office, to reduce the cost of living. After they took office the cost of living increased. Our criticism was of their breach of promise, not of the fact that the cost of living had increased. We have enough sense to know that if goods which we import are higher in price one year following another, the cost of living will increase. We did not criticise the then Government because of the increase in the cost of living. We did criticise them for having successfully misled a great number of people by a promise to reduce the cost of living. Clann na Poblachta had literature specifying that they would reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. The others were wiser and did not say by how much it would be reduced. The facts are as I say and not as Deputy Collins would have the House believe, that we criticised the increase in the cost of living. The Deputy is also quite at sea in [698] his dates and, consequently, in his facts about increases in wages and the time when the Standstill Order with regard to wages was removed. He is also quite wrong when he says that there have been no increases in wages since the present Government came into being some 20 months ago.

4434532,1833,9,139,Water Services Bill 2013 [Seanad]: Report and Final Stages (Continued),07/03/2013,Mr. Fergus O'Dowd,Fine Gael,Louth,"Deputies Catherine Murphy and Cowen referred to the Bord na Móna proposals for augmenting the water supply for greater Dublin area. Deputy Murphy lives in a constituency where there has been significant investment by private enterprise to improve the water supply in terms of the industry that is involved. I believe they are paying €29 million in advance to the local authority for future water supply. So there is an issue there regarding improvement. Everybody accepts that the infrastructure needs to improve and it is no secret that to have state-of-the-art water services nationally we need to invest €600 million per annum on capital improvements in order to meet the future demands of the greater Dublin area and to mitigate climate change issues that arise. As Members have said on Second and Committee Stages, 42% of all the water we treat, pump or store never reaches any household. It is referred to as unaccounted water. A significant proportion of that comes from leaks. Infrastructure, which in some cases is 150 years old, needs to be radically improved. We need transparency on the cost of all these issues - everybody wants to know how much they will pay. That will be determined by the energy regulator and not the Government, Bord Gáis Éireann or Irish Water. The regulator will need to get the business plan from Irish Water, and examine all the existing running costs and the future capital investment. In the United Kingdom when the regulator decides a price it remains fixed for five years and if there is a significant increase in inflation, it can adjust it within the five-year period. All of those issues will be dealt with openly, transparently and accountably. There is no question of people not knowing what it will cost. There is no question of not having total transparency and accountability from Irish Water to the regulator. When the regulator makes proposals, they will be put out for public consultation and then there is also the question of making its determination. An important part of all our administration here is the accountability for Irish Water to the Oireachtas. The legislation provides for accountability through the annual report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I have been a member of Oireachtas committees in the past. The committee will have the power to call representatives of Irish Water to appear before the committee if an issue arises of concern to it. That will be a very important part of the democratic accountability process. Deputy Stanley and others referred to the accountability to local representatives on the ground. This is a critical issue. Deputy Catherine Murphy pointed out that some of her constituents had no water supply and did not know whom to contact - I have also come across such people in my constituency in the past. Local authority staff have a very proud record of being able to respond in times of emergency. The accountability of Irish Water to local authority representatives, the Oireachtas and most of all to public is a critical issue. The structures will need to ensure that accountability is there and that elected representatives - Deputies, Senators and members of local authorities - have the same access to the management team in an area as they have at present. Where the service levels exist Irish Water will be in a position to ensure that the local elected representative has that number. Irish Water will be accountable to elected representatives on the issues that arise. The second piece of legislation covering many of the governance issues that have been raised will be properly teased out here in the Oireachtas. Many people are concerned about how to resolve a possible conflict between the water infrastructure requirements for a local authority development in a city, town or community and any Irish Water plan for improvement of water infrastructure. One possibility would be that many of the planning decisions might be made at a regional authority level. That framework will need to be spelled out in fine detail before any charges will commence. The Bill before the House is effectively enabling legislation to allow the regulator to commence its work and to set up the company. Deputy Cowen asked for the estimated cost of the metering programme. It would be inappropriate to release estimates of the cost of the metering programme in advance of completion of the ongoing competitive procurement process. It is intended that the metering programme would be funded through borrowing on commercial terms from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, and that is from the Fianna Fáil national recovery plan, published in 2010.",07/03/2013,31,762,763,programme would be funded through borrowing on commercial terms from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and that is from the,Fianna Fáil,national recovery plan published in 2010,Fianna Fáil,4434532_6,,programme would be funded through borrowing on commercial terms from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and that is from the Fianna Fáil national recovery plan published in 2010,programme would be funded through borrowing on commercial terms from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and that is from the national recovery plan published in 2010,text664,0,1,0,0,26,0.038461538,1,1.098612289,0.042254319,-0.08,-0.003076923,0.735735736,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.870870871,0.23023023,0.212212212,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2632893,352,9,115,Nomination of Taoiseach (Resumed).,05/01/1993,Mr. Alan Dukes,Fine Gael,Kildare,"One would expect to find that after years of high public investment there would be a good response in terms of employment but the record is totally different. During the course of the election campaign Deputy Spring seemed to discern that he had some difficulty in that regard. He said at one stage, I cannot remember his exact words, that he saw nothing wrong with public investment in areas where it would produce a satisfactory return. He carefully did not define what he would regard as 'a satisfactory return'. The Fianna Fáil Party for all its modern jargon I believe suffers from the same intellectual blindness on this issue. It is also a devotee of these famous household gods of public investment. Many Members of this House will remember the absolute apoplexy of indignation that we saw from the then Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance in 1984 when I proposed that we should introduce guidelines for the assessment of public capital expenditure programmes. Many will remember the savage opposition of the Fianna Fáil Party to our programme for improving the performance of our commercial semi-State companies and the Labour Party who were in Government with us at the time, between 1982 and 1987 supported our programme. That programme produced very significant and useful results. The very idea of applying to investment in the public sector anything like the criteria that we applied in the private sector was enough to send Fianna Fáil into orbit. I would bet my bottom dollar that [532] sometime over the next year or so Fianna Fáil will come before us again and will pretend that it has in place systems for measuring the possible return on public investment. If that happens I will be delighted, especially if Fianna Fáil mean it. I will be astonished also, because it does not fit with the old fashioned religion of the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil about public investment, to expect that the taxpayer should be given some kind of assurance that he or she will get the same value for money out of public investment that we rightly look for from private investment. I am not talking about housing, schools or hospitals but without economic investment, without that kind of approach to public investment on the part of these two parties who are now about to set up in Government, we would be wasting taxpayers' and EC money. It was never more important to have economic investment than it is today when we have 300,000 people unemployed and are about to embark, apparently, on a seven year programme to spend £8 billion of European Community money added to whatever capital moneys we raise from our own resources. It seems that the people who are in charge of making decisions about all that should be almost demonically concerned with getting value for money, because value for money means a chance for some of those 300,000 people to get a job when we are spending these billions. That programme should be guided by a very hard headed determination to build a case for sustainable extra employment, but I fear it will be guided by an outdated doctrinaire prejudice that is shared by the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil. While this rather passionless dalliance has been going on between Fianna Fáil and Labour the rest of the world has not stood still. We still have uncertainty in currency markets. Irish exporters are in all kinds of difficulty and all kinds of businesses in the Border areas are in serious difficulty. It is true that some short-term palliative measures have been put in place but they will not solve the [533] problem they cannot and will not solve the problem. It is blatantly obvious that we need a realignment of currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism and that individual devaluations can be no substitute. That means a number of simple but difficult political things. It means, for example, that the German Government must be told it is time to stop making the rest of the world carry the burden of German reunification which we all support, that it is time for the German people to start bearing a bigger part of the cost. It is time to tell the French Government that while a realignment at this stage might be politically embarrassing in the run up to March elections, failure to realign could be even worse, and the evidence is there today. If we do not have a realignment, the French franc will be the next target, and there are some suggestions of that today. That would produce even more electoral embarrassment next March than a realignment today. Our Government should be busily engaged in putting together at EC level the political forces and alliances that will secure that common sense result, but of course, our present Government cannot do that. It is a lame duck, outgoing caretaker Government trying to decide how much of its barely held economic principles it should ditch in order to become the weakened partner in a new coalition. Across the Irish Sea the British authorities are setting in place procedures for the scrutiny of the next phase of a major expansion of activity in Sellafield. I hear the Irish Government is thinking of making mild noises about objecting to that but what it should do before the deadline expires next Monday, is make it unambiguously clear that we want a full public inquiry which will allow all our concerns to be put fully before the competent British authorities. In addition, we need more concerted action at European Community level to prevent any member state — whether the UK or any other state — visiting the consequences of unreflected growth in these areas on its neighbours. Again, our present Government has not got the [534] moral or political authority to do that nor will it have before next Monday — the expiry date for making objections under procedures currently in force in the UK. There is a series of other problems waiting to be dealt with and I do not think they are being addressed in these negotiations. Over the last few weeks Members will have been receiving letters from the bakery and confectionery industry which is being severely damaged by the differences in VAT rates on both sides of the Border. Under the 1992 Finance Act, for example, people involved in riding establishments are subject to four different rates of VAT and for some activities, theoretically they can be subject to three different rates of VAT for services delivered to the same customer. We have a VAT law which places hotels that let rooms for functions in a very anomalous position. Is anybody addressing those problems? Is there any plan to address those problems in the budget we will have next month or in a Finance Bill we will have later? I note with gladness that the lunatic proposal for putting a third banking force in place now seems to be disappearing. The proposal was to create in effect, a political bank owned by the State, like the old Soviet Gosbank. That proposal was yet another example of the devotion of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party to the old redundant family gods of public ownership. As far as I know the Gosbank in Russia is now very sensibly being privatised. I am delighted to see that the Fianna Fáil-Labour version of the Gosbank will be choked before it is born. Is there any space for consideration of these and a host of other pressing problems in the discussions that are going on, or are the negotiators sitting around congratulating each other on the quality of the rhetoric each is producing with regard to the Government programme? The final nonsense comes from the way the media are beginning to write so wisely, so percipiently and so perspicaciously about the fact that there are some social reforms that can be carried out without involving a lot of money. What a blinding flash of insight. What an [535] amazing discovery. I am astonished that our hardbitten political reporters can fall for that old nonsense. We have always known that there are great many social reforms that can be carried out without costing a great deal of money but, hey presto, when we have two parties in discussion having difficulty agreeing a budget, all of a sudden, by accident, the media discover that there are some social reforms that can be implemented without costing a lot of money. What is happening? I will tell the House what is happening. The spin doctors in the Labour Party — I do not know whether Fianna Fáil have a new spin doctor yet after the departure of the last man who made such a bags of the GPA flotation — found that they had to have something nice to say coming up to the end of last week and they make this great discovery that some social reforms do not have to cost money. They will mention a date for a divorce referendum we will have legislation to deal with the fallout from the X case and I am sure there will be five or six other things in the programme. When the people see the programme they should not be impressed by it. They should besiege the party head-quarters of Fianna Fáil and Labour asking why these things were not done 20 years ago, when the biggest obstacles to doing them were people in Fianna Fáil and, I regret to say, the odd one in the Labour Party as well.",05/01/1993,27,172,173,we should introduce guidelines for the assessment of public capital expenditure programmes Many will remember the savage opposition of the,Fianna Fáil,Party to our programme for improving the performance of our commercial semi-State companies and the Labour Party who were in,Fianna Fáil,2632893_4,,we should introduce guidelines for the assessment of public capital expenditure programmes Many will remember the savage opposition of the Fianna Fáil Party to our programme for improving the performance of our commercial semi-State companies and the Labour Party who were in,we should introduce guidelines for the assessment of public capital expenditure programmes Many will remember the savage opposition of the Party to our programme for improving the performance of our commercial semi-State companies and the Labour Party who were in,text335,2,1,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-0.510825624,-0.012770641,-0.015617376,-0.000390434,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.186186186,0.199199199,0.317317317,0.317317317,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company have been less successful than anticipated in their early years in obtaining engine maintenance contracts because of the worldwide recession in the airline industry which has reduced demand sharply for jet engine overhaul. While the setting-up phase of Airmotive is likely, therefore, to take somewhat longer than originally anticipated, there is every expectation that this will be a highly successful high technology Irish company. In relation to asset disposal, also raised by Deputy Wilson, as I have explained in my Second Stage speech, a comprehensive package has been designed to bring the air companies back to profitability as soon as possible. This includes the equity investment by the Exchequer, the cost [1407] alleviation payments and action by the airline themselves to restore their finances to viability. In the latter connection, I have outlined the action being taken by Aer Lingus with a view to improving efficiency and reducing costs in every aspect of their operations. In regard to asset disposal, it is a matter for the company themselves to make the maximum contribution which is commercially prudent from their ancillary activities towards the resolution of their present problems. I am aware that Foxhills, to which the Deputy referred, has been advertised for sale and that some parts of the Tenerife property have been sold. It is a matter for the board of the air companies to determine what further contribution can be made from within their own resources towards solving their financial difficulties. The question of turnover of services at Shannon has been raised by Deputy O'Donnell, who suggested that Aer Lingus transatlantic services should be turned around at Shannon. I stress that Shannon is the country's transatlantic airport and will remain so. However, we cannot avoid the fact that Aer Lingus need both Dublin and Shannon traffic to fill their Boeing 747s. In fact, the two airports contribute almost equally in the generation of traffic for the transatlantic service. The feasibility of using feeder services between Dublin and Shannon has been examined in detail many times, but because of the marketing considerations and other operational reasons the option is not really practical. Deputy Raphael Burke made a number of points countering points made by Deputy O'Donnell. The debate on this point shows the complexity of the whole situation. As I have said, Dublin and Shannon are essentially complementary feeding points for the Aer Lingus transatlantic operation and I can see no situation in which Aer Lingus will not continue to serve both airports. Deputy Bernard Allen questioned the cost of the dual-stop requirement. While double landings clearly cost more than a single stop, marketing considerations dictate [1408] that the airline must serve both airports. In relation to Cork Airport, which was raised by Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Allen among others, following a critical evaluation of services into Cork, Aer Lingus concluded that the restructuring of their services for summer 1983 was called for. While the original plan envisaged the virtual elimination of direct plane services between Cork and the Continent the revised schedules which Aer Lingus devised would have given a better range of services — admittedly directly through Dublin — into Cork from the major European destinations. In the process Aer Lingus would have been expecting to realise a cost saving of some £700,000 a year. The scaling down of direct plane services was not viewed in the most favourable light by the local Cork community and, following a series of very constructive meetings between Aer Lingus and a group representative of all Cork interests led by the Lord Mayor, Deputy Coveney, a compromise package was recently agreed, with the new arrangement to come into effect at the end of the month. It is disappointing that traffic through Cork has been on the decline in recent years and, the costs continuing to rise, this has posed problems not only for Aer Lingus but also for Aer Rianta. A loss of roughly £.5 million was incurred by Cork Airport last year and if the surplus on commercial activities such as duty free sales were left out of the reckoning the loss on operations would have been of the order of £1 million. With no great prospect of traffic recovery this year Aer Rianta are facing a difficult position in Cork. It is against that background that the company's concern about the financial fortunes of Cork must be looked at. In that regard Aer Rianta are looking at all of the options in the same way as any prudent commercial enterprise would do when it sees the gap between its costs and its revenues widening. Clearly, a State company would be failing in its task if it did not take account of emerging trends. At the same time, bearing in mind in particular the headlines in one of this [1409] morning's newspapers, I want to make it clear that there is no question of Aer Rianta taking unilateral action of a drastic nature in terms of their employees in Cork.

1984647,184,14,91,Allocation of Time: Motion.,09/04/1981,Mr. Frank Cluskey,The Labour Party,Dublin South-Central,"The Taoiseach, unfortunately, will find it as difficult to dispose of me as he will of parlimentary democracy. As long as the Taoiseach wants to be Taoiseach, as long as he stays there without facing the people, he will have to face this Opposition. He will not evade it because we will pursue him. We will point out the mismanagement of the economy which he has presided over. We will point out that that mismanagement has led to untold hardship and suffering in the country. We will point out all the issues the Taoiseach has evaded and he continues to evade. Would the Taoiseach not be better employed in the interests of the country to stay here a little longer and let us know about his attitude, unequivocally, on neutrality, let us know if he gave the commitments, which Deputy Boland stated this morning he gave, to the relatives of the Stardust tragedy and let us know if the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, clear and unequivocally, is being, can or will be discussed in these studies which are taking place? [1630] Would it not be better if the Taoiseach stayed here a little longer and let us know, clearly and unequivocally, what policies he has to try to put the 126,000 people who are unemployed back to work, let us know in clear, unequivocal terms how he will make up the very significant and obvious shortfall in the Estimates? There are many other things which could be discussed. The Taoiseach's term of office has been distinguished by one thing more than any other, his evasiveness. Everything has come under the heading of confidentiality and secrecy. We had this with Mrs. Thatcher and we now have it with the Stardust people. Every time a legitimate question was asked in the House and it was politically difficult and embarrassing, the Taoiseach used one of two tactics. He jumped behind procedure or he said the matter was confidential. The confidentiality is over and the bit in the bunker is over, because whether the Taoiseach likes it or not the time is coming when he will have to face the Irish electorate. The Taoiseach can evade us here for three weeks, he has the 20 votes to do it, but he cannot evade his responsibilities for ever. He certainly will not evade the wrath of the Irish electorate.

My own mother spent the last years of her life as a blind person and I know what it is like to have a blind person in the house. To cut such a person’s benefit by €16 a week over two years is very unfair. A total of €40 billion was found to pay off the Ulster Bank people yet the blind pension, the carer’s benefit and the disabled person’s pension was cut. The Minister should be ashamed. I understand that cuts had to be made but why did the weakest in society have to bear them?

2649700,274,21,176,Private Members' Business. - Health Charges: Motion (Resumed).,31/03/1993,Mr. Martin Cullen (Resigned),Progressive Democrats,Waterford,"I thank Deputy Allen for giving me some time to speak on this motion. Because my time is so limited I shall not waste valuable minutes by bringing to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, the various comments he made when speaking as an Opposition Deputy in the past five, six or seven years. I have two or three points that I should like to raise, however. I seriously question the role of the health boards, something upon which the Minister has commented. I do not believe that value is being obtained from the health service. The administrative and other costs associated with the organisation and operation of the health boards are very unsatisfactory. I ask the Minister to examine one way of beginning to reduce the role of the health boards, for it is impossible to remove them overnight. In the development of the regional [1663] hospitals and the major hospitals strategically placed throughout this country, a leaf should be taken from the book of the Department of Education, which oversaw the transition of regional colleges from the control of vocational education committees to the Department. It is my belief that the regional hospitals should deal directly with the Department. Regional hospitals should be directly accountable for what they do, how they spend their money and develop their services. That would be preferable to the practice by which regional hospitals are locked into the overall health board structure, which is outmoded and cumbersome. Vast savings could be made not only in terms of cash but also in terms of efficiency, if the health boards were removed. I am absolutely convinced that a better and more direct relationship with the Department would be one way of moving forward. Is the Minister considering legislation to allow the VHI to own, operate and run private hospitals? This is a measure the VHI has sought for a long time. Hospitals owned and operated by the VHI would be run much more efficiently. The changes and cost controls implemented by the VHI in past years are evidence of that board's efficiency. The VHI should at least be allowed the opportunity to examine the possibility of running hospitals itself. That ability is allowed to BUPA and other agencies in other parts of the world and the VHI should be allowed to do the same. I cannot understand why the health service provided by our hospitals is as bad as it apparently is. For instance, in the new regional hospital in my area the wards are closed and nothing happens. In the new hospital, people are still in beds in the corridors during the weekends. In the past two weeks I had to take my child to that hospital and I realised the seriousness of what is happening. Millions of pounds have been spent, yet the new facilities provided are locked up. Are we telling people that they can get sick only during the week, not in the weekends? It is ridiculous to pretend that [1664] people do not need specific, serious and urgent medical care during the weekends. Surely there is something seriously wrong in the system when such vast sums of money are provided for capital expenditure but there is no provision of resources to utilise the capital assets. I ask the Minister to respond to the three points I have raised.",31/03/1993,27,35,36,Because my time is so limited I shall not waste valuable minutes by bringing to the attention of the Minister,Deputy Howlin,the various comments he made when speaking as an Opposition Deputy in the past five six or seven years I,Deputy Howlin,2649700_2,,Because my time is so limited I shall not waste valuable minutes by bringing to the attention of the Minister Deputy Howlin the various comments he made when speaking as an Opposition Deputy in the past five six or seven years I,Because my time is so limited I shall not waste valuable minutes by bringing to the attention of the Minister the various comments he made when speaking as an Opposition Deputy in the past five six or seven years I,text719,3,1,0,1,40,-0.05,-2,-0.84729786,-0.021182447,-0.118585412,-0.002964635,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.153153153,0.163163163,0.19019019,0.216216216,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2096200,446,8,52,"Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1983: Second Stage (Resumed).",06/07/1983,Mr. Pat (The Cope) Gallagher (Seat vacated 06-06-2009),Fianna Fáil,Donegal South-West,"Before the adjournment of the debate I was the dealing with the competition we are experiencing not alone from third countries—the legislation before the House is meant to prevent boats from such countries fishing here— but from EEC countries also. The Dutch have a quota of 35,000 tons and they had a similar quota last year. They went to the Commission and said: 'mea culpa we have landed 1,000 tons over and above please forgive us'. In fact, they claimed a subsidy from the EEC for £190,000. They appear to be in a position to ignore all rules, regulations and quotas set down by the EEC. We should expose this and I have no doubt that the Minister will. The Minister should endeavour to ascertain how the Dutch obtained the other 145,000 tons on which they claimed a subsidy from the EEC. In my view it amounts to a manipulation of figures only. We are obeying the rules and regulations and playing the game but they are working to our detriment. Those involved in the industry should continue to take better care of the fish using the improved facilities which are available to them. The processors and exporters should be enticed to add greater value to their products thus creating more employment here. I am realistic enough not to accept the theory that all fish landed should be processed here. I can see valid reasons why cans of fish [1828] produced in other countries are displayed on supermarket shelves here. It must be remembered that our industry is in its infancy. We should do our utmost to work our way up the added-value scale until we are able to make such products available here. We must experience competition but I do not believe finished goods from other countries is the problem at present. Any business today has high powered marketing and the fishing industry has a marketing problem like any other developing. We are competing against the professionals and the multinationals. We must strive to improve our methods so that eventually we can produce commodities of the highest standard and we must make every effort to cut down on imports by substituting the home-produced product. The Commission should consider a system of price support for the fishing industry, somewhat along the same lines as that given in respect of agriculture. In the debate on the Estimates for the Department I spoke about the need for greater co-ordination between the various bodies. For far too long the attitude between the fishermen and the processors was 'us versus them'. Things have changed for the better, but there is need for greater co-ordination and the Department must give the lead. The Minister should initiate talks between representatives of the fishermen, the processors and those involved in the marketing and service sectors. A council should be set up with power to deal with matters concerning the industry. Each sector needs the assistance of the others if the industry is to prosper. They should have at their disposal the expert advice of officials in the Department and of BIM. That organisation have been criticised here on numerous occasions but they have played an important role in the development of the fishing industry. Possibly BIM are somewhat confined because of their terms of reference and I suggest that the terms should be looked at again. BIM have the personnel to do the job if the terms of reference are changed. Deputy Daly spoke about the round robin financial system used by some countries in the EEC. It is well known [1829] that penalties are not high enough. Even the penalties suggested today by the Minister in relation to third country boats would not be high enough if they related to boats of EEC countries because of the system that operates. The Dutch are building vessels for the specific purpose of fishing off the west coast. Their quota of 35,000 tonnes has been reduced by 25 per cent but one has to ask the question why are they building these super boats. It is to fish off our coasts. Their quota could be caught by two of the Irish refrigerated sea water vessels in a short period. A maximum penalty should be imposed to keep foreign vessels, including the Dutch, from raping our fisheries. The existing penalties are only a joke. The Dutch and other countries find it very cheap if a penalty is imposed on them here. Our laws are not stringent enough and the penalties are not high enough to deter them from coming here. I welcome the introduction of the Common Fisheries Policy but that is only similar to outline planning permission. It is useless unless we are prepared to forge ahead with a national fisheries policy. It is regrettable that steps have not been taken up to now even to discuss the possibility of having such a policy. The common fisheries policy is only a base. I hope in the next few months the Minister and his officials will give consideration to a national fisheries policy, which I consider a necessity. I wish to comment on the Department's management system which will be put into operation irrespective of our quota. I have had discussions with fishermen, particularly those who are finding the financial strain of repayments too much for them. Boats over 90 feet will be allowed only 500 tonnes per week. We cannot accept that system or the quotas to which I referred earlier. I did not have an opportunity of speaking in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism. There is an important link between that Department and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. We became aware of that last November when it was obvious that boats would have to tie up because of problems in [1830] obtaining money from Nigeria. It transpired that it would take three or four months before the money came through. The then Minister, Deputy Daly, with Deputy MacSharry in the Department of Finance and Deputy Flynn, in the Department of Trade Commerce and Tourism did an excellent job. The Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism with the ICC insured that facilities were made available to the processors and they did not have to stop freezing fish. However, what happened then should be enough warning to ensure that something similar does not happen this year. Apart from the officials in the Department and the Minister, I do not think anyone here realised the seriousness of the position. I suggest that the Government provide credit guarantees to our exporters similar to those provided to our main competitors, particularly the Dutch and the British. This export credit could be provided by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. The risk involved is minimal. In so far as Nigeria is concerned, at the end of the day the risk lies with the Central Bank of Nigeria. The Nigerian market was opened by the then Minister, Deputy Daly, and I have no doubt that this Minister will continue that policy and ensure that we keep the market we have obtained there. I hope the Minister will go there at the first opportunity to ensure that the work initiated by Deputy Daly is continued and that the market share is increased. Without the provision of export credit the industry could come to a standstill. Our fleet would have no outlet for their fish apart from the 25 per cent taken by the freezer vessels and the floating factories that come here each winter. The Bill is exceptionally clever. We asked the Government to introduce it to ensure that the Spanish or any other third country boats would not be allowed to operate the system which they operate in the UK at present. The UK introduced legislation in March to prevent this. It is only right and proper that we should also take similar steps but it would be interesting to know how effective this legislation is in the UK and if it has prevented [1831] these boats from continuing to fish there. I believe the UK were more specific at the time, although I am open to contradiction on this. We are doing this by the Minister making an order stating that a percentage of the crew members must be Irish. There is no reference to the actual percentage, although it should be the maximum percentage as introduced by the British of at least 75 per cent or more. The Bill refers to a percentage only and that section must be tightened up. Section (2) of the Bill proposes that Irish registered fishing vessels can only fish in Irish waters in accordance with the terms of a licence issued by the Minister. This is a very serious matter because by implication—and I hope the Minister will clarify this—we are suggesting that Irish boats can only fish inside the 12-mile limit. I see the Minister shaking his head and I am sure he will place it on the record that it does not refer to Irish boats in Irish waters outside the 12-mile limit. Section (3) provides for the Minister to make regulations specifying conditions and the nationality of crew members to which I referred earlier. There is a loophole in that section. It is vague and weak and the percentage of the crew members should be stated more clearly. It is also suggested in that section that the company may register here and operate from this country. I am anxious for clarification of whether this permits any of the third countries to register a company here and allows them to fish. If so, that section should be amended.",06/07/1983,24,995,996,from Nigeria It transpired that it would take three or four months before the money came through The then Minister,Deputy Daly,with Deputy MacSharry in the Department of Finance and Deputy Flynn in the Department of Trade Commerce and Tourism did,Deputy Daly,2096200_2,,from Nigeria It transpired that it would take three or four months before the money came through The then Minister Deputy Daly with Deputy MacSharry in the Department of Finance and Deputy Flynn in the Department of Trade Commerce and Tourism did,from Nigeria It transpired that it would take three or four months before the money came through The then Minister with Deputy MacSharry in the Department of Finance and Deputy Flynn in the Department of Trade Commerce and Tourism did,text566,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.09486833,0.002371708,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.57957958,0.555555556,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2583444,580,9,147,Nomination of Members of Government (Resumed).,11/02/1992,Mr. Enda Kenny,Fine Gael,Mayo West,"The appointment of a new Taoiseach and Government is a time of excitement and disappointment for many people. It is a day which will be remembered by all Members, especially those who are promoted or demoted, as the case may be. It would be remiss of me not to mention the contribution made by Deputy Haughey as a TD, Minister and Taoiseach to this House and politics in general. His was always a visible and vibrant political presence always controversial and always taking a particular point of view. I would like to thank him for his unfailing courtesy at all times in this House and for his deligent work in making available facilities to all Oireachtas Members. I am sure that the accolade he sought of having worked to the best of his ability for the good of all the people will be acknowledged. As a French author wrote years ago: Heureux qui comme Ulysse a fait un beau voyage—happy he who, like Ulysses, has made a great journey. I take this opportunity [1624] of wishing the outgoing Taoiseach and his family every success on his retirement. This is a day of enjoyment, disappointment and even bitterness for some people. Some families are jubilant and some are very disappointed. The appointment to Government will mean a change in family life and increased responsibility for those concerned. I wish those who have been appointed to the rank of Cabinet Minister every success and good fortune in his or her position. However, as members of political parties we have to deal with the consequences of the decisions taken today by the newly appointed Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds. It is imperative that everybody who takes on a constitutional role ensures that he or she meets their responsibility with diligence, vigour and enthusiasm. I was struck by the interviews given by the new Taoiseach in the past weeks. It is obvious that merit, performance, ability, hard work and team-work are common denominators in his chosen appointments and as evidenced from the interviews given by him, those are the characteristics he was seeking. One recent comment was that he would wish to see more women appointed to his team and that they would play a greater role in Irish life and Irish politics. If the criteria for appointment to Government include merit, ability and performance why was Deputy O'Rourke, the Taoiseach's onstituency colleague, dropped from the Cabinet? It appears to have been a case of vindictiveness but I trust that is not so. While I certainly differed with Deputy O'Rourke in her capacity as Minister for Education she was able to deal with teacher unions which are quite diverse in their objectives. She was one of the few Ministers for Education who ever received a standing ovation at teachers' conferences. That kind of performance warrants a place in this Cabinet, and the new Taoiseach certainly has made a major blunder in dropping Deputy O'Rourke from her position — I am not here to defend her. The Taoiseach said recently the economy and unemployment would be [1625] his greatest priority as Leader of the Government. The unemployment figures in every employment exchange should be available in Departments on a monthly basis as a measure of the performance of each Minister appointed today in terms of dealing with the economy and reducing unemployment. It is a national scandal that human talent and energy is wasted because people cannot find jobs. The performance of each Minister should be measured by the numbers unemployed. Meaningful jobs should be provided for these people, giving them the opportunity to use their talents and better their lifestyles. In regard to the appointments, the minor partner in Government were quite happy to be left in their Ministries. Deputy O'Malley who has responsibility for Industry and Commerce deals particularly with industrial incentive and job creation. From an Opposition viewpoint the change in Cabinet positions has been quite dramatic at first glance. To appoint so many backbenchers of such experience and political achievement is indeed historic. I am not sure they will be content. The Taoiseach has made sweeping changes. Many people on the Fianna Fáil benches will be very angry that the Minister for Finance, a young man with a vision of Ireland and capable of relating to ordinary people, did not have the courage to let his name go forward for election as Leader of Fianna Fáil. However, that is a matter for that party. Obviously, the Government will be very confined in their work when one considers the economic constraints on them and on the Minister for Finance. The budget is only a smokescreen for the changes that will be made next year. The granting of the special pay awards, the introduction of the Single Market next year, the drafting of Estimates later this year and the implementation of a budget in 1993 will prove to be extremely difficult. The 1992 budget will be seen merely as a smokescreen for greater changes to come. As Seán Lemass said in 1966: 'The years ahead will be a great [1626] time to be alive, to be young and to be Irish'. We will have to wait a number of months to see if the amalgamation of minds and talents will result in a solution to the problems facing us. Deputy Molloy remains Minister for Energy. Deputy Garland referred to that Minister's pressurising of a local authority in regard to the implementation of county development plans. I am not clear as to the law in relation to mining activities. The Minister for Energy instructed the local authority of which I am a member not to introduce a blanket ban on mining as it would be contrary to Government policy. He said that local authority members should have faith in the planning procedure and in environmental impact analyses. Yet the same Minister, for religious and historic reasons, introduced a ban in defined areas. If we are to have faith in the planning process and in the outcome of environmental impact studies, why did the Minister give a direction to ban mining in certain areas? This matter is of great importance to the local economy as well as to the national economy, and it needs to be clarified from a legal point of view. Deputy Woods has been nominated as Minister for the Marine. In the short term he served as Minister for Agriculture and Food he recognised from his experience the value of a scientific research into agriculture. As a result of his visit to the west and in particular to the institute at Belclare, County Galway, he declared that centre should not close down because of the value and importance of the research work carried out there. I hope his successor will stand by that policy. I trust that Deputy Woods, in his review of the law of the sea, will be in a position to ensure that Irish fishermen will have the opportunity to earn their livelihood off our coast, thus creating the necessary on-shore jobs. Deputy Séamus Brennan has been nominated as Minister for Education. I said previously that the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, was enlightened in her ministry and she at least livened up the Department. I wish Deputy Brennan [1627] well, because that Department is often quite difficult to work in. He will be dealing with a small segment of the overall budget and I trust he will be in a position to look after the interests of first, second and third level students. It is obvious from all the surveys and studies that have been carried out that although in the next ten years or so more students will be emerging, there will be fewer opportunities for employment. Obviously if they are going to have to go abroad to work, and this seems likely, they should be given the very best training and education. I hope the Minister will be able to strive at Cabinet level for further funding to ensure that resources will be made available for our students. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn is obviously very capable, articulate and intelligent. However, I wonder what her personal view is on the Shannon stop-over. Will it continue to be Government policy to retain the stop-over at Shannon or will it be a split decision between Shannon and Dublin? What stand will Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn take on the up-grading of the Galway, Westport and Sligo lines? Will she have sufficient clout to ensure that both Government and European funding will be provided for this? I wish her well and hope she will deal successfully with communications, tourism development and other fundamental issues connected with her portfolio. The fact that Deputy O'Connell has been nominated as Minister for Health after a very long period in this House causes me to wonder. I distinctly remember that in the late seventies and early eighties, Deputy O'Connell, then a member of The Labour Party was very enthusiastic, diligent and vibrant in his pursuit of health matters. Were he to be appointed Minister for Health, I think he should have been appointed to that post back in 1973. This is a strange appointment but I wish him well in this very difficult ministry. I honestly do not see any great change being made in the numbers waiting for orthopaedic, cataract and other operations unless there is a massive change of heart at Government [1628] level, but the recent allocations to the health boards do not indicate that. Deputy Smith has been nominated as Minister for the Environment, a major, free-spending Department. Deputy Smith is obviously a man of intelligence, ability and perceptiveness. I wonder, however, if the recently reviewed Programme for Government will have to be reviewed again. The programme states quite clearly that the proposed regional councils will be set up by the end of March of this year and that the sub-county districts will be set up before June of this year. Let me say that every single councillor, Senator and TD from practically all the political parties is completely and totally opposed to setting up another layer of bureaucracy without teeth or finance, and requiring another level of administration. Since the Government are unable to provide the finance to run the county councils how in the name of high heaven are they to be expected to implement and set up a further layer of bureaucracy with none of these facilities? This could well be the crunch issue between the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat elements of the Government. As Deputy Smith comes from a rural constituency he would well know the state of the county roads and I hope he will be in a position to do something about them. Deputy Andrews has been a Member of this House for 27 years, which is a very long time indeed and his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs is well merited. He is a man of considerable ability. Having served with him on the New Ireland Forum and on the British-Irish Association, I have no doubt that he will carry out the very great responsibilities given to him. He is the tallest member of the Cabinet.

3095575,967,9,84,Private Members' Business. - Ansbacher Accounts Queries: Motion (Resumed).,09/02/2000,Mrs. Nora Owen,Fine Gael,Dublin North,"It is mind boggling what the Taoiseach expects us to believe. I am sure Deputy Foley was not a constant visitor to the Taoiseach's office. I never saw him going over there. He was a backbencher, although a senior one being vice chairman of the most senior committee in the House. He did not go on many walks to the Taoiseach's office. However, on 15 December he was invited to the Taoiseach's chamber, probably his first time in that hallowed office. The Taoiseach did not ask him whether he had an account, owed tax, broke the exchange control laws or what discussions he had with the tribunal. I can understand somebody saying that the tribunal must make the final decision on this, but that the Taoiseach is the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party. A member of his party sat on the Committee of Public Accounts Sub-committee on Certain Revenue Matters and he knew that its report would be published the following day. He also expected that in the weeks following the publication of this report much praise would be heaped on the sub-committee for its excellent work, yet he sat idly by and did nothing. The Taoiseach told the House that Deputy Foley was thinking about resigning from the Committee of Public Accounts. Leadership required the Taoiseach to ask him to resign from that committee immediately and if it transpired that what was alleged did not occur his membership of that committee could have been considered again. It was the Taoiseach's prerogative to appoint Deputy Foley to the committee and it was also his prerogative to ask him to resign. Earlier we were informed that Deputy Foley tendered his resignation from membership of that committee. It appears that every time the Taoiseach did not want to know what was happening he sent three or four intermediaries, including the Government Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan – the great nanny of our time – to do his business. He did not ask Deputy Foley what was happening at the tribunal, whether he would leave the parliamentary party or resign from membership of the committee, but instead asked some backbenchers who were friendly with the Deputy to ask him what he intended doing. These people were asked to tell [157] Deputy Foley that he was not wanted in the parliamentary party and it would better for him if he left.

4438277,2291,14,91,Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed) (Continued),14/03/2013,Mr. Michael Conaghan,The Labour Party,Dublin South-Central,"For too long in Ireland, even the most minor criminal conviction hasa mounted, in effect, to a life sentence. A person may not be condemned to spend the rest of his orh er life behind prison walls, but he or she is condemned to a lifetime of stigma, lost career opportunities and serious difficulties in rebuilding a normal life. The Bill before the House is a most welcome step in the slow process of reorienting the criminal justice system away from a system which merely serves to penalise wrongdoers towards one which will allow them to be rehabilitated in the interests of the entire society. Much of what is considered normal in Irish prisons should not happen in a civilised country. The job of reforming the prison system is a massive one. The Government has committed to closing St. Patrick's Institution for young offenders, which has been condemned for many years by many expert groups as completely unfit for purpose. More than this, the Government has, in a time of austerity, done what Fianna Fáil failed to do when it was throwing money around, namely, make the necessary funding available to make the closing of St. Patrick's Institution a reality. However, there is much more to be done. The prisons are overcrowded practices such as slopping out are not acceptable and broader reform of the system is necessary. It is in this context that I welcome the Bill. By international standards, Ireland is years behind other countries. The United Kingdom first introduced spent convictions legislation nearly 40 years ago in 1974. Last year Mr. Liam Herrick of the Irish Penal Reform Trust was able to write: 'The fact that Ireland remains the only EU state without any system of spent convictions is only one example of how we condemn even minor offenders to lifetime barriers to employment.' I welcome the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, who, in opening the debate on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, said this spent conviction legislation was only one strand of a suite of policies to avoid the creation of a gap between offenders and 'normal society'. Other aspects include a focus on youth diversion programmes and the use of non-custodial alternatives such as probation, community service and restorative justice measures. These are very fine policy priorities and I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss them at a later stage. We must ask what is the purpose of the criminal justice system. Is it just to punish? Certainly, this is one element, but so too is rehabilitation. Unfortunately, this is not a strong enough current of thought. One shining light in this area is the prison education system. Curriculums devised by the City of Dublin VEC play a valuable role in allowing people to leave the prison system with much greater literacy and numeracy skills. Many prisoners really do engage with the education service. They want to better and prepare themselves for the world outside. I pay tribute to the teachers and City of Dublin VEC for this remarkable aspect of their education service. Serving a custodial sentence is, in reality, only one part of the equation. Recreating a normal life outside of prison can present further serious difficulties. For example, the obligation to inform an employer of a conviction sets off an alarm bell that is impossible to quieten. It is an employers' market. In a choice between two candidates of equal merit - one with a conviction and one without - there will be only one winner and it would be hard to blame the employer. According to the Law Reform Commission, only 52% of employers would employ an ex-offender. In similar research the Small Firms Association claim this figure rises to between 76% and 87%. People must have the opportunity to reintegrate fully into society. Finding a job is an essential part of getting back to a normal life. Where someone is determined not to reoffend, it is only right that, after a certain period, he or she be allowed to leave his or her past behind. Where someone cannot find work, it is possible that old habits might re-emerge. Without hope, the likelihood of a return to criminal activity increases. There might be an economic incentive to return to crime. If we are serious about reducing recidivism, we must be serious about rehabilitating prisoners and ensuring they have hope on their release. The Bill will not put in place a mechanism to have any conviction to be expunged and will not wipe clean a person's criminal record rather, it will put in place a system under which certain convictions, at the less serious end of the criminal spectrum, will not have to be disclosed in certain circumstances where a person does not reoffend for a set period of time. The time period after which a conviction must not be disclosed varies, depending on the severity of the crime, the length of sentence involved and so on. A sliding scale will be put in place, from a maximum of a five year rehabilitation period in the case of a 12 month custodial sentence down to a two year period for less serious offences. The measures contained within the Bill do not apply to every criminal conviction and there are necessary safeguards. Serious offences such as murder, manslaughter, sexual offences and others are excluded from the remit of the Bill. A conviction involving a sentence of more than 12 months cannot be considered spent under the Bill. Neither will repeat offenders be able to have their convictions considered spent. No individual can have more than two spent convictions, even if they meet all of the other criteria. Similarly, there are safeguards in place regarding the types of employment where the measures outlined in the Bill do not come into effect. For example, where a person seeks employment which involves working with children, vulnerable persons or certain State bodies and Departments, all convictions must still be disclosed. In 2011 there were over 11,000 prison committals with sentences of up to 12 months which would fall within the remit of the Bill. The Bill will give those convicted hope that, once they make a commitment not to reoffend, they will be able to leave their past behind and rebuild their lives. It achieves a balance between giving hope to those who seek rehabilitation and maintaining the need for disclosures in the public interest. I welcome the Bill as a positive step towards a criminal justice system that will have rehabilitation and reintegration into society as its core objective.",14/03/2013,31,317,319,how we condemn even minor offenders to lifetime barriers to employment I welcome the comments of the Minister of State,Deputy Lucinda Creighton,who in opening the debate on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality Deputy Alan Shatter said this spent,Deputy Lucinda Creighton,4438277_2,,how we condemn even minor offenders to lifetime barriers to employment I welcome the comments of the Minister of State Deputy Lucinda Creighton who in opening the debate on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality Deputy Alan Shatter said this spent,how we condemn even minor offenders to lifetime barriers to employment I welcome the comments of the Minister of State who in opening the debate on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality Deputy Alan Shatter said this spent,text398,3,4,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.251314428,0.006282861,0.126491106,0.003162278,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.582582583,0.577577578,0.636636637,0.603603604,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3924083,2014,9,221,Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) (No. 2) Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed).,27/11/2008,Mr. Frank Feighan,Fine Gael,Roscommon-South Leitrim,"I always find Wexford to be warmer than Roscommon. I left Boyle, which is on the N4 and drove through Athlone, Tullamore, Portlaoise and on into Enniscorthy. On the way home I decided I would use the N11 and the M50. Despite the fact that the latter route is up to 50 miles longer, the return trip was 50 minutes shorter. A community without a motorway or a dual carriageway is being discriminated against. There are motorways from Dublin to Belfast and Dublin to Galway but a swathe of the north west still has single carriageway roads. The new Roosky by-pass is a single carriageway with two lanes each way which is effective. At least it is safe for overtaking and it is good value for money. I compliment Leitrim County Council and the NRA for constructing the road. In the same area there is a 12-mile single carriageway which was only constructed a year and a half ago. This is the N5 Charlestown by-pass but it is not possible to overtake on this road because it is not dual carriageway or a dual-lane road. We need a motorway to the north west but in the meantime dual carriageway roads are vital. The N5 to the west is the same as it was 30 years ago. The N4 is an improvement but a lot more needs to be done to give access to the regions of the west. [40]Deputy Browne highlighted the case of the holiday homes tax of €200 which is destined for a central fund. The services are provided by the local authorities and therefore the local authorities should have full access to that revenue. In my area of counties Roscommon, Leitrim and Longford, there are many holiday homes and also, unfortunately, many unsold houses. This tax would be vital for rural local authorities. Today I attempted to raise on the Order of Business the question of flooding in my area, which occurred because there was no demarcation lines between the Office of Public Works and the local authorities. No maintenance was carried out on certain rivers and streams so that when the floods came the roads were blocked by fallen trees and were washed away. It costs up to €2 million to replace narrow rural roads. The effects of flooding could have been alleviated if some body was responsible. The county councils say it is not their responsibility but rather that of the OPW and the OPW say the opposite. The sooner legislation is in place to decide who is responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of these tributaries and rivers, the better otherwise the same problem will arise again. I do not want to be going back to the farmers, the landowners, the householders who were terrified for their lives. Much damage was caused but thankfully, there were no fatalities although there were some near misses. This is an issue that needs to be addressed. The M50 has improved over the years because we are paying a huge amount for it. It costs me a toll of €2. 70 each way to Dublin and it is another €2 each way if I use the M50, making a total of €10. If we are paying money for the upkeep of the roads in Dublin, we should get fair play in the west. We are not doing enough to promote the use of electric cars as they are a very innovative use of energy which can be generated cheaply. Their use would remove our dependence on fossil fuels. I do not have much time for SUVs and four by four vehicles. Only about 1% of the people who drive these vehicles need them for the work they do. The Government has done a reasonable job in getting people to move away from the SUVs. They are dangerous when in collision with other vehicles or pedestrians or a bicycle. The chances of coming off unscathed from such a collision are very slim. These vehicles were regarded as a fashion item or accessory but the less we see of them on the roads, the better. I agree they are useful vehicles for farmers and builders or for certain lines of work but one does not need an SUV to bring children to school. We went over the top and the sooner we roll back from these outdated modes of transport, the better. I would encourage schools to have a traffic management plan to allow young children to cycle or walk to school with their friends because there is nothing better and it is environmentally friendly.",27/11/2008,30,240,241,an improvement but a lot more needs to be done to give access to the regions of the west 40,Deputy Browne,highlighted the case of the holiday homes tax of 200 which is destined for a central fund The services are,Deputy Browne,3924083_1,,an improvement but a lot more needs to be done to give access to the regions of the west 40 Deputy Browne highlighted the case of the holiday homes tax of 200 which is destined for a central fund The services are,an improvement but a lot more needs to be done to give access to the regions of the west 40 highlighted the case of the holiday homes tax of 200 which is destined for a central fund The services are,text572,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.089343448,0.002233586,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.566566567,0.544544545,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3986611,628,8,96,Finance Bill 2009: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.,27/05/2009,Mr. Brian Joseph Lenihan RIP,Fianna Fáil,Dublin West,"I note Deputy Morgan’s comments and I assure him that the Commission on Taxation will deal this matter. We could assist the public by being factual in our assertions with regard to it. In that context, if one earns income in Ireland, one pays tax on it. If, however, one does not reside in Ireland, one does not pay tax on income one earns elsewhere. There is nothing unusual in that legal arrangement. It appears to be a feature of this debate for people to suggest that Ireland is somehow out of line or unusual in the context of the arrangements that are in place here. Those arrangements are almost identical to those which obtain in the United Kingdom. If Deputy Morgan has evidence that a particular individual is living here for more than half the year and is not paying the full tax on his or her income around the world, he can put the Revenue Commissioners in possession of that information in order that they might investigate the matter. Everyone is aware that the Revenue Commissioners have extensive access to information relating to particular taxpayers. It is open to the Deputy to do as he sees fit in respect of this matter. It is useful to have a public debate on this issue. However, we must have a peg on which we might hang a particular person. We cannot simply say that because he or she was originally a [751]citizen of this country and has now made a great deal of money through his or her business dealings across the globe, he or she must pay tax here on his or her entire income. There are two countries which employ citizenship as a basis for taxation, namely, the United States and Eritrea. It is fair to ask why we could not use citizenship rather than residence as the basis of our taxation system. One reason is that attempting to link liability to income tax with citizenship is totally out of line with the normal practice in OECD countries — most of which are our neighbours — where tax liability is based on residence and not on citizenship. It is desirable, as a matter of general course, to have a similarity of treatment with one’s neighbours in respect of an international matter of this nature. A specific difficulty would arise in the Irish context if citizenship were to be employed as the basis of taxation because there is a very extensive access to citizenship in this country. As Deputies are aware, citizenship of Ireland is obtained by birth or descent or through marriage or naturalisation. These are the general categories that apply. The extensive access to Irish citizenship for those who do not live here is part of our history of migration to other parts of the world. Very few countries outside Ireland recognise the right to a grandchild to obtain citizenship. In addition, and as I am sure Deputy Morgan is well aware, we have always attributed citizenship throughout the territory of the island of Ireland on an equal basis. Were we to decide to impose taxation on the basis of citizenship — I do not wish to rake over old embers here — we would be obliged to send tax return forms to virtually every resident of Northern Ireland. In his amendment, Deputy Morgan seeks to narrow the position by including a stipulation with regard to people relying on their Irish passports. A passport, which is issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is only evidence of identification of citizenship. It does not represent a person’s citizenship but it is a sign that he or she has committed himself or herself to being protected by the State. Ireland has an extremely large number of passport holders, namely, 4. 3 million, which is more than the population of the State. It is worth noting that under the nationality and citizenship legislation, the individual has a right of renunciation of citizenship. Any Irish citizen is free to apply to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to renounce his or her citizenship. It is true that the Oireachtas could suspend that right in order that military conscription could take place. In general, however, there is a facility whereby citizens may apply to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to renounce their citizenship and they must act in good faith in respect of this facility. Even if one negotiates the practical hurdle of sending tax forms to everyone in Northern Ireland and then assesses the tax position of other Irish citizens living abroad, one is still left with the fact that a person can renounce his or her Irish citizenship. The reason the United States is able to base its taxation system on citizenship is that it is such a powerful country. We do not possess an equal level of power. I note that Eritrea has followed the US example but it is the only tax-collecting country to have done so. We base our system on residence because that is what our neighbours do. That is why people move back and forth. As I informed Deputy Burton in respect of an earlier amendment, there are two areas in respect of which the concerns that exist might be addressed. The first is that the Revenue should police the provision that is already in place. I am satisfied that it does so. The second is whether greater international efforts can be made to outlaw, on a mutual basis, places which sell tax residencies at a discount, for a premium or whatever. There is no other solution because the facts of residence and non-residence are incontrovertible. [752]Constant reference is made to individuals who are prominent here in respect of this matter. I am not sure of the identities of these people but the implication is that they are very generous with particular charities or may be active in sporting life. There are a number of individuals who are Irish and who are prominent here but who maintain that they live abroad. If there is any evidence in the possession of Deputies that the people to whom I refer do not live abroad, it should be placed in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.",27/05/2009,30,553,554,here we would be obliged to send tax return forms to virtually every resident of Northern Ireland In his amendment,Deputy Morgan,seeks to narrow the position by including a stipulation with regard to people relying on their Irish passports A passport,Deputy Morgan,3986611_3,,here we would be obliged to send tax return forms to virtually every resident of Northern Ireland In his amendment Deputy Morgan seeks to narrow the position by including a stipulation with regard to people relying on their Irish passports A passport,here we would be obliged to send tax return forms to virtually every resident of Northern Ireland In his amendment seeks to narrow the position by including a stipulation with regard to people relying on their Irish passports A passport,text795,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.047434165,0.001185854,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.488488488,0.476476476,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2602575,24,9,99,"Private Members' Business. - Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).",29/04/1992,Mrs. Monica Barnes,Fine Gael,Dún Laoghaire,"It was because of such heart breaking cases that Deputy Fennell felt there was not only a real need for this Bill but a real urgency about it. Therefore, while the Minister of State naturally made a case for not accepting Deputy Fennell's Bill, I think all of us would agree that this Bill could stand in its own right. The Minister said that the Bill is not broad enough and does not meet all the international standards, but if the Bill is given a Second Reading we can work on the areas referred to by the Minister on Committee Stage. This would enable us to strengthen the Bill. We could even consider setting up a special committee to deal with any complex matters in the Bill. It is appalling to think of the way in which these services have been allowed to be downgraded. As both the Minister of State and Deputy Fennell said, we are not in accord with international standards in this area or the Human Rights Declaration of the United Nations, an organisation of which we are proud to be a member. We make a very serious and generous contribution to the UN peacekeeping operations, but we need to study the UN conventions, the Declaration on Human Rights and the rights of women and children to ensure that not only do we have a high profile in terms of our peace-keeping activities, which we all fully support but that we can also stand proudly at the UN, and in Europe and say that we have introduced legislation which does not deserve any criticism. As the Minister rightly said, this area has not been reviewed or amended for many years. Deputy Fennell pointed out that the objective of her Bill was to amend the 1945 Mental Treatment Act. Great strides have been made in medical procedures and particularly in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Thankfully we no longer treat those who were termed 'mad people' as other than human beings who are suffering a deterioration of mental and emotional faculties and, therefore, need treatment. Certainly, they should not be segregated or stigmatised for the rest of their lives. I would like to think that the changes [2090] made in these areas will be taken into consideration in the preparation of a Bill. Deputy Fennell pointed out the loopholes in the very real injustices against people in this isolated and vulnerable position. The objective of her Bill is to provide greater safeguards against inappropriate detention in mental hospitals. Nobody could have believed that that type of enforced incarceration and total denial of a voice and of justice to a citizen could have taken place. Deputy Fennell has been raising this matter for many years. Yesterday she outlined a very dramatic and heartrending case. It shocked all of us that in 1991 what seemed to be a Dickensian case arose where a woman was not alone denied protection within her family home but was wrongly placed in detention. In such a case it is impossible to prove that you are sane and that you have been wrongly detained. That is why we must be very careful and responsible in this area. Not only are these people vulnerable but they are powerless once they are admitted to a mental hospital. It is almost a catch 22 situation because to insist that one has been unjustly and wrongly detained sometimes seems to add to the diagnosis of insanity. That is something we must guard against resolutely. We must ensure that mental patients have the same rights as the rest of us. They must have full access to commital documents relating to them. Due to the precarious position in which they find themselves we must positively discriminate in favour of these people who are denied the opportunity of making a case for themselves and who, if they were not detained and cloistered would be accepted as responsible. Deputy Fennell highlighted something we all find unacceptable. The last thing we should allow here is a two-tier health service with a difference between private and public treatment. An urgent review is needed is this area. Those who read this Bill I am sure will support the thrust of it. It provides protection and support for the people concerned. It would amount to civil rights for patients if the time bar of six months during which legal [2091] proceedings may be instituted for wrongful commital, and providing for normal access to the court for damages for false imprisonment, was eliminated. Such a time bar is not just unnecessary it creates an injustice which, considering what the person has gone through, is intolerable. We must ensure that these people have equal rights and access to courts and documentation. I agree with the concept of review boards and that the representation on these boards should be broadly based. They should consist not only of skilled professionals but also of compassionate lay people with experience and community care expertise. Until such a structure is set up patients who have been treated in an unjust way will feel vulnerable. It is important that there be an objective board to which these people can make their case and that they be seen to be independent. It is hard to believe that it is only now we are attempting to amend the 1945 Act considering all the changes that have taken place and the hardship and injustice suffered by some people. It is wrong to talk about review committees, Green Papers or reports, before drafting such legislation. Legislation at the drafting stage will not include all the necessary safeguards and be free of anomalies and loopholes. That is why the debate on Second Stage and, particularly, Committee Stage is so vital. Committee and Report Stage debates are the backbone of our procedures in Parliament. In the majority of cases a Bill undergoes a great process of change in the House. I appeal to the Minister to use this Bill as a foundation on which he and the parliamentary draftsmen can build. We accept that in drafting a private Bill a Deputy cannot avail of the expertise and drafting skills that are available to a Minister. A tremendously strong arm of our democracy is that Private Members' Bills are allowed to be introduced and this allows us to debate urgent matters that may have taken a back seat because some of our most vulnerable, voiceless and powerless [2092] people are involved. This Bill sets out to represent their views. I appeal to the Minister to consider seriously the tremendous boost it would be to the work of this House and to the rights and privileges of this House if a Private Members' Bill which was introduced in such a spirit of sincerity and which reflects a genuine need were taken on board. Deputy Fennell had not the back-up resources of the parliamentary draftsman and I commend her on the amount of work she has put into this Bill. She would be the last person to say that this Bill is perfect in every way but we can all say that it highlights the desperate injustice which can befall some of the most vulnerable people in our society unless such safeguards are written into legislation. May I once again appeal to the Minister, whom I know to be very compassionate and who recognises the thrust of Deputy Fennell's Bill, to use the Bill as the foundation for improving and broadening mental health legislation. The Fine Gael Party and Deputy Fennell, in particular, would be agreeable to accepting amendments. We are not claiming that the Bill is perfect, but it is a great start. With the level of support in this House for the Bill and with the aid of the Department's expertise, we could produce a very fine Bill and we would not have on our conscience the terrible injustice of incarcerating people who do not need treatment but who are totally isolated and powerless to fight committal when this happens to them.",29/04/1992,26,1257,1258,Bill to use the Bill as the foundation for improving and broadening mental health legislation The Fine Gael Party and,Deputy Fennell,in particular would be agreeable to accepting amendments We are not claiming that the Bill is perfect but it is,Deputy Fennell,2602575_9,,Bill to use the Bill as the foundation for improving and broadening mental health legislation The Fine Gael Party and Deputy Fennell in particular would be agreeable to accepting amendments We are not claiming that the Bill is perfect but it is,Bill to use the Bill as the foundation for improving and broadening mental health legislation The Fine Gael Party and in particular would be agreeable to accepting amendments We are not claiming that the Bill is perfect but it is,text215,0,4,0,0,40,0.1,4,2.197224577,0.054930614,0.306859518,0.007671488,0.94994995,0.974974975,0.978978979,0.923923924,0.876876877,0.825825826,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

789778,674,22,154,Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 11—General (Resumed).,01/05/1952,Mr. Seán MacEntee,Sinn Féin,Monaghan South,"Let us see what are the facts. The Dáil will remember how, with a flourish and loud music from the Labour Party, Deputy Norton, [963] when Tánaiste, announced the establishment of a Prices Advisory Body. This was a body which, according to Deputy Norton, was specially chosen by the then Government to put manufacturers and others who sought increases in prices through all the processes of the Inquisition in order to discover the truth about their costs and profits. Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, played a very large part in the selection of the personnel of that body. The Prices Advisory Body has been kept in being by the present Government and functions as effectively under us as it ever did under our predecessors. Last year, the Prices Advisory Body, having duly considered an application from the tobacco manufacturers, recommended that they should be permitted to increase the price of the standard cigarette by 2d. per packet of 20. Now the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not immediately give full effect to that recommendation. Instead he went at first only half of the way and granted permission for an increase of 1d. last October. That, however, could only be regarded in all fairness and in all justice as an instalment since it did not meet by any means the increase in the cost of the tobacco leaf and other charges which have occurred since the former standard price was fixed. It is necessary because of the continued rise in these costs to concede now the full increase recommended by the Prices Advisory Body. These are the circumstances under which Deputy McGilligan alleges we are making a gift of 1d. per packet of 20 cigarettes to the tobacco manufacturers.",01/05/1952,14,272,273,these costs to concede now the full increase recommended by the Prices Advisory Body These are the circumstances under which,Deputy McGilligan,alleges we are making a gift of 1d per packet of 20 cigarettes to the tobacco manufacturers,Deputy McGilligan,789778_4,,these costs to concede now the full increase recommended by the Prices Advisory Body These are the circumstances under which Deputy McGilligan alleges we are making a gift of 1d per packet of 20 cigarettes to the tobacco manufacturers,these costs to concede now the full increase recommended by the Prices Advisory Body These are the circumstances under which alleges we are making a gift of 1d per packet of 20 cigarettes to the tobacco manufacturers,text929,0,1,0,0,37,0.027027027,1,1.098612289,0.029692224,0,0,0.715715716,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.785785786,0.323323323,0.323323323,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
745575,674,22,154,"Committee on Finance. - Vote on Account, 1951-52—Motion (Resumed).",07/03/1951,Mr. Seán MacEntee,Sinn Féin,Monaghan South,"Perhaps before I devote myself to an examination of the general economic position of the country, I might correct a statement which has just been made by Deputy Kyne. I was Minister for Local Government in 1947 and I did not terminate the hand-won turf scheme. I did issue a circular indicating that the production of hand-won turf could be better undertaken by the specialised organisation which had been set up by the State under the Fianna Fáil Government for the development and exploitation of our peat resources rather than by the improvised organisation which had been set up in time of emergency under the county councils. I pointed out in the circular that the work of reconstructing and restoring the roads which had been so heavily damaged during the emergency was urgent and that for that purpose the Government were giving a free grant, I think in that year of over £2,000,000 and in the following year of over £4,000,000, to enable the county [1392] councils to employ their skilled staff and their experienced engineers upon the job for which they were originally recruited. That was the purpose of the circular which was issued by me in 1947, and which transferred the responsibility for producing hand-won turf from the local authorities to Bord na Móna. What happened in the year 1948 was the responsibility of the Government of that day and not of the Opposition. It is interesting to look at the figures which appear on the volume of the Estimates for the Public Services for the year ending 31st March, 1952, in respect of which we are now considering the Vote on Account. We have there set out the total cost of the Supply Services for the year broken up into two components—the capital services which are costed at £12,079,000 and the Supply Services which are estimated to cost £70,956,000. In all, and this is the significant relevant figure, the Government anticipate that during the coming year they will spend no less than £83,000,000 of the people's money. Whether that money comes from taxation or whether it comes from inflation, it is money taken out of the pockets of the people and used by the Government for their own purposes. It is quite true that you can do more harm to the economic structure of the country if you take it in one way rather than in another. I venture to say that when the Estimates for the Central Fund services are before the Dáil it will be quite clear that irresparable damage is being done to the finances of this country by the policy which is being pursued by this Government since it came into office, that is, of borrowing where they ought to have taxed to defray public expenditure. However, we have here this figure of £83,000,000 for the Estimates for the Supply Services for the coming year. But let nobody in this House deceive himself that that is going to be the whole tale or toll of expenditure. At the moment, we are endeavouring to cope with Supplementary Estimates that are falling upon this House as the leaves fall in autumn. They are pouring [1393] in upon us in a spate, in a full flood tide, indicating the extravagance even at the last moment of the eleventh hour of the Government under which the people are now groaning. It is impossible to keep track of them all. In some cases, it is impossible to check them all but they are miserable in information, grandiose in magnitude and prodigal in conception. Over and above the £78,000,000 which we were asked for this time last year, we have been asked to provide in round figures, and not taking into account any broken thousands, over £1,500,000 within these past few days. During the year which is now closing, over that £1,500,000 additional which is now being demanded, the Dáil voted another £500,000, making, so far as I can ascertain, the total amount asked for under the head of Supplementary Estimates at least £2,000,000. Now we may take it as certain that when the financial year 1951-52 is drawing to a close we shall again be asked, either in the last month of that year or during the course of the year, to provide at least another £2,000,000 over and above the £83,000,000 with which the country has been confronted during the past few days. That will make £85,000,000 in all for what may be described as the normal expenditure visualised under the expensive policy of the present Government. In addition to that, and there is no provision for it in this volume, the Minister for Social Welfare has indicated that the Government will look to the taxpayer to provide—it will not provide—another £1,000,000 for old age pensions. We have then an additional £4,600,000 as the contemplated State contribution under the Social Welfare Bill, if it ever becomes law. When we tot all these things up we find that the true estimate for Government expenditure during the coming year, so far as we can visualise it, is of the order of £90,600,000. That leaves out of account the £3,400,000—or, shall we put it this way, the burden of the Minister for Social Welfare's stamps, £3,400,000 of which is to be provided by the worker in the first instance—some may succeed in passing this part of it on to other members of the community—[1394] and £4,600,000 to be found by the employers which will definitely be passed on, with added profit, to the consumer. The position may be roughly summed up as follows: over and above the amount which will be provided by taxation, definitely imposed as taxes and not cloaked as contributions, there will be this £8,000,000 additional burden imposed on trade, industry and agriculture to be passed on by the producers in practically every industry except one, namely agriculture, to the consumers and ultimately to the taxpayers. The real expenditure then with which the community is confronted at the instance of the Government, and in order to serve the Government's ends, is not £83,000,000 as appears on the Book of Estimates but almost £100,000,000 if it will not exceed that sum. Let us now turn for a moment and contemplate the Minister in his earlier swashbuckling days when he came in here proclaiming proudly that he would cut everything and then suddenly found that he was about to cut off the nose of the Coalition in order to spite its Labour face. In the days when the Minister was still preaching the Fine Gael policy, in the days when he was all for retrenchment and reductions in the cost of living, in expenditure and in taxation, the actual expenditure under the last Fianna Fáil Budget, according to the Minister's own speech, for the year ending 31st March, 1948, on all supply services was £58,527,000. To-day, as I have shown, the probable expenditure forced by the Government upon the community will be about £100,000,000, or £42,000,000 more than it was in the year which closed on 31st March, 1948, an increase of over 70 per cent. in public expenditure and concomitant public taxation. We know that, just as Deputy Kyne endeavoured to justify the present inflationary expenditure on the grounds that a great deal of it will be spent on social services, the Minister, if his memory fails him, will probably take that line also when he is closing this debate. It will, perhaps, be salutary then to remind the House and the Minister and the Fine Gael members of the Coalition Government what the [1395] present Taoiseach said in respect of the Budget of 1947-48, under which £58,000,000 was provided for the supply services. On the 13th May, 1947, at column 72 of Volume 106 of the Official Reports, Deputy Costello, as he then was, said:— 'Has he ever adverted to the fact that high taxation in itself takes money from those who would have saved it, thereby creating an asset in building up the economy of the State, or from those who are unable really to pay it, thereby creating a hardship for some section of the community?' As I gathered, the whole purport of Deputy Kyne's speech was: 'We are going to spend £83,000,000 in this year and let the taxpayers and the producers and the workers of this country-remember that you cannot have an omelette without breaking eggs, you cannot spend money without increasing taxation,' and, as the present Taoiseach told us when he was in opposition, in 1947, you cannot get that money without taking it 'from those who would have saved it, thereby creating an asset in building up the economy of the State, or from those who are really unable to pay it, thereby creating a hardship for some section of the community.' That was the Taoiseach's attitude towards the comparatively moderate expenditure, the really and truly moderate expenditure of that time as judged by the standards which prevail to-day. Then the Taoiseach went on to gibe at those who, like Deputy Kyne, said: 'We are spending all this money on social services.' I trust that those who believe that the Taoiseach's heart bleeds for the suffering poor will remember the words which I am now going to quote: 'Here we have him spending away.' —He was referring to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken— 'There is no proposal for the reduction of Government expenditure or for economy. It is not even envisaged that there shall be any restriction in Government activities. [1396] He is on the left of the economic thoroughfare there because, as has been said by speaker after speaker on the opposite benches, the money is wanted for social services.' That, I assume, will be the excuse of Deputy Kyne and, indeed, of the members of the Fine Gael Party who were never on the left of the economic thoroughfare until they were goaded there by the need to keep Deputy Kyne, Deputy McAuliffe and Deputy Desmond in harness behind them, if one can put it that way, or—should I say?—in harness in front of them, drawing them and drawing Fine Gael where it did not want to go. I am quite content.

2947862,1051,14,115,Private Members' Business. - Duty Free Sales: Motion.,10/02/1998,Mr. Emmet Stagg,The Labour Party,Kildare,"If there were any doubt about the future of duty free or whether the decision made in 1991 could be reversed, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, with his well known directness and honesty gave it the kiss of death tonight. From any fair reading of his speech, the fight is over. The absence from the proceedings tonight of the champion of duty free, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is also instructive. The Minister for Finance stated that the package of taxation included the duty free sales decision. A reply to a question my party tabled to the Department of Finance today stated that the decision to abolish duty free in 1999 was not contingent on a programme of tax harmonisation. The idea that has been sold that we will lose the whole package if duty free is not abolished is not the opinion of the Department of Finance. This was stated in a reply today Last autumn, during the Second Stage debate on the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill many Deputies spoke at length about their concerns at the proposed abolition of duty free. I am pleased to have this opportunity to draw attention to this vital matter again and I thank the Fine Gael Party for tabling the motion. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has been particularly vocal on this matter and I fully support her actions in trying [1521] to reverse the 1991 ECOFIN decision. This Government has been adept at making the u-turn an essential part of Government policy and I welcome the Minister's efforts to have this modus operandi raised to the European level. However, I do not hold out much hope for her efforts. This matter was discussed at a meeting of the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport on 7 January. During that debate the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, indicated that there was an earlier decision to scrap duty free from 1992 onwards. She undertook to have her officials examine the papers from that time to demonstrate the point and to make the papers available to the committee. No papers have been produced to date. However, I have carried out my own research and it appears the Minister is wrong and may have inadvertently misled the House. The position is crystal clear and the Minister for Finance's speech also made it clear. The original proposal from the Commission was to abolish duty free from 1992 onwards. That was not a decision, it was only a proposal and required the unanimous agreement of the Finance Ministers to give it effect. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, had the power to veto that Commission proposal. Instead, he accepted a modified proposal to abolish duty free in 1999. He also had a veto on that proposal, but he did not use it. He voted for it. That is why we are where we are now on this issue. This chicken is about to come home to roost with a vengeance. The ECOFIN decision of 1991 was a disgrace and the Taoiseach must take full responsibility for his actions on that occasion. He had a veto on that fateful night, but for some reason, which to the best of my knowledge he has never fully explained, he choose to abolish the Irish duty free industry rather than ruffle the feathers of his fellow Finance Ministers around the table. The Taoiseach has always traded on his reputation as a consensus seeker, but on that night he elevated this quality to the point of absurdity. I read with interest in The Irish Times on Saturday that the Taoiseach currently employs seven people in his media monitoring unit at an estimated cost of £130,000 per annum. Perhaps he should consider diverting a small amount of that sum away from his spindoctors in Mount Street to do an assertiveness training course before he signs away the future of Irish workers again. The decision to abolish duty free is adhered to by many EU policy makers with a near religious fervour. It is an irrational, destructive and unnecessary policy decision, but the mandarins in Brussels, and Commissioner Monti in particular, are determined to implement this nonsense. The EU abolition of duty free will produce not one positive benefit for any EU citizen. It will bring inconvenience, hardship and misery to thousands of citizens, yet the Commission is intent on implementing the decision. In the forthcoming Amsterdam Treaty referendum we will again hear calls for the promotion [1522] of a citizen's Europe. If the Commission is intent on destroying a European-wide industry for the sake of abstract philosophical coherence, those of us who promote the European ideal will have a hard time countering well founded public disillusionment with the EU. The effects of abolition of duty free here will be enormous and will probably effect every family in some way. The magnitude of this decision is only dawning on the Irish public. The Taoiseach's decision of 1991 will have a devastating effect on tourism, commerce, Aer Rianta and airline and ferry companies. More than 2,000 workers are directly employed in the Irish duty free industry. These jobs are directly under threat with the abolition of duty free which was voted for by the current Taoiseach in 1991. Aer Rianta earned £26 million in 1996 from duty free sales, representing more than half its profits for the year. Because of the success of Aer Rianta's duty free operation we currently have one of the lowest systems of airport charges in Europe. This will not be tenable when duty free is abolished. It will lead to higher airport charges for airlines which will be passed on to consumers through higher ticket prices. This could have a knock-on effect on our inflation rate. My party colleague, Deputy McDowell, has been at pains to point out the inflationary effects of the Minister for Finance's budget carve up. Reductions in capital gains tax, the reduction in the higher rate of income tax and the onset of EMU will lead to inflationary pressures on our economy. Increases in transport rates for people and trade will also feed into this Government inspired spiral and could, in the long-term, put our economic success at risk. I do not wish to appear alarmist but there is serious cause for concern at this Government's tax and fiscal policy to which Ministers seem oblivious. The abolition of duty free will severely restrict Aer Rianta's plans for investment and expansion and will place unnecessary and untimely strain on the finances of one of our most successful semi-State industries. It is ironic that at the same time as we finally manage to put Aer Rianta on a statutory footing through the Air Transport and Navigation (Amendment) Bill, the EU is intent on cutting the ground from under them by this madcap insistence on the abolition of duty free. Given the severe cut in revenue that Aer Rianta will suffer in the coming years, I ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Enterprise to re-examine their decision to pillage the coffers of Aer Rianta as part of the process of conferring on them semi-State status. The £14 million the Department is demanding from Aer Rianta is morally wrong, but in the face of the abolition of duty free this smash and grap decision is also commercial madness. I urge the Ministers responsible to give every consideration to reversing this daylight robbery. The impact of the 1991 ECOFIN decision will extend to all our international transport operations. Ferry companies, airlines and our airports [1523] will suffer a severe loss of revenue and no doubt this loss in income will be compensated for by increased fare prices and job losses. Many workers in the duty free sector also earn a substantial amount of their wages from commission on duty free sales and the loss of this will affect ordinary workers in a very real way. I support the Minister's actions in trying to reverse the 1991 decision of her party leader. However, I cannot hope the Minister will succeed in her endeavours. The sound of the stable doors being closed keeps ringing in my ears whenever I read reports of the Minister's offensive in Europe. It was the Taoiseach who got us into this mess and it is he who needs to explain his decision to destroy a thriving industry with the wave of his hand. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is taking much of the heat on this issue but the Taoiseach cannot hide behind her forever and must account for his actions in 1991. Bluff, bluster, kicking to touch and shadow boxing are no substitute for action. I doubt, having heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, today there will be any real action. I wish to share my time with Deputy Shortall.",10/02/1998,28,436,438,a proposal and required the unanimous agreement of the Finance Ministers to give it effect The then Minister for Finance,Deputy Bertie Ahern,had the power to veto that Commission proposal Instead he accepted a modified proposal to abolish duty free in 1999,Deputy Bertie Ahern,2947862_6,,a proposal and required the unanimous agreement of the Finance Ministers to give it effect The then Minister for Finance Deputy Bertie Ahern had the power to veto that Commission proposal Instead he accepted a modified proposal to abolish duty free in 1999,a proposal and required the unanimous agreement of the Finance Ministers to give it effect The then Minister for Finance had the power to veto that Commission proposal Instead he accepted a modified proposal to abolish duty free in 1999,text969,1,3,0,0,40,0.05,2,0.84729786,0.021182447,0.232185823,0.005804646,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.651651652,0.63963964,0.804804805,0.750750751,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2085135,991,8,137,"Estimates, 1983. - Vote 49: Industry and Energy (Resumed).",09/06/1983,Mr. Albert Reynolds,Fianna Fáil,Longford -Westmeath,"I should like to point out to the House that while industry and energy forms the total responsibility of the Minister, on this side of the House we have divided responsibility with industry and employment on one side and energy on the other. I should like to inform the House that my colleague Deputy O'Malley will deal with energy when the debate resumes on Tuesday and I will deal with the industrial side. I am sure Deputy O'Malley will not mind if I refer to a few minor matters in the energy field, ones in which I had a particular interest. There was a reference by the Minister to negotiations in relation to Kinsale gas for Belfast and Northern Ireland. I listened attentively to what the Minister said, that negotitions were still in progress, but we have now passed the first birthday of these negotiations which were finalised not started — in May of last year between Mr. Adam Butler and myself, as Minister for Industry and Energy. Like the Minister I should also like to express pleasure at the manner in which those negotiations were conducted. However, I fail to understand why after two long evenings, one in Iveagh House and the second at Stormont Castle, the matter has not been finalised. We reached agreement on all heads for the supply of gas. It is understandable that the agreement had to be put into contract form but it is important [1198] to record that we reached full and final agreement on all aspects of the supply of natural gas, the quantities asked for, the price, the escalator clause, the mix of currencies to be applied in payment for the gas and the energy components making up that complex area of negotiations. I do not underestimate the problems that had to be dealt with and I should like to pay tribute to the officials in the Department who were involved in the intricate negotiations for their untiring efforts in the negotiations. It is important to record that around the table at Stormont Castle we reached agreement. Not alone that but we shook hands on that agreement. At Mr. Butler's request we proceeded to the steps of Stormont Castle for him to announce that agreement had been reached. It was then only a matter for the Irish and the British Governments to approve the terms of the agreement. I do not know of any situation where two Ministers of two sovereign Governments reached agreement and announced it in public before the television cameras and in the media in Belfast. Naturally enough I was only too delighted to join with Mr. Butler in the same announcement. It baffles me to think what we have all been at over the past 12 or nearly 13 months. Before I left the Department I went through all the final telex messages and there was no doubt that it was only a matter of getting together and signing the documents. Have the negotiations been reopened? What has happened? The British Minister had officials with him from the Treasury in London. I can understand those officials trying to get a better deal and taking advantage, as they saw it, of an incoming Government. Perhaps they thought they could upset the deal and get better terms. At the first meeting with Mr. Butler in Iveagh House he gave the clear impression — probably good tactics in negotiations — that he thought the price we would be looking for the gas would be a lot lower than the price I was talking about. He said that impression was given to him clearly by my predecessor. I have no knowledge of that. Perhaps there was some element of truth in it and perhaps not. I do not know. [1199] If they are trying to upset the deal and looking for a cheaper price, applying all the pressures for which British Governments are well known in negotiations and in tactics, I expect the Minister to stand firm on the terms. They are related to the price at which the gas will be sold in Dublin. I believe it was an excellent deal. Obviously they thought it was too good a deal for us if they tried to upset it. Where agreement is reached at ministerial level, with nothing remaining but the formal rubber stamping at Government level, I would expect the agreement to be implemented. Everybody attending these negotiations had plenipotentiary powers. I had from the Government here, and the Government had no hesitation in endorsing what I said. We still do not know what the present position is. The Minister said this matter went on right up to the time of the British election. There was an interesting announcement during that election campaign from John Hume. He said he had it from the highest authority in Dublin that the deal was over and done with. Listening to the Minister today one would not get that impression. When questioned in more depth about it John Hume was absolutely adamant that that was the true position and he had it from the highest authority in Dublin. I would expect that the Minister opposite would be the highest authority in relation to this matter.",09/06/1983,24,54,55,and employment on one side and energy on the other I should like to inform the House that my colleague,Deputy O'Malley,will deal with energy when the debate resumes on Tuesday and I will deal with the industrial side I am,Deputy O'Malley,2085135_1,,and employment on one side and energy on the other I should like to inform the House that my colleague Deputy O'Malley will deal with energy when the debate resumes on Tuesday and I will deal with the industrial side I am,and employment on one side and energy on the other I should like to inform the House that my colleague will deal with energy when the debate resumes on Tuesday and I will deal with the industrial side I am,text383,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.158113883,0.003952847,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.693693694,0.653653654,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
683145,622,2,91,Committee on Finance. - Vote 55—Industry and Commerce.,25/05/1949,Mr. Con Lehane,Clann na Poblachta,Dublin South-Central,"Deputy Lynch had certain animadversions to make upon the attitude which he alleged was adopted by Clann na Poblachta and other Parties in the inter-Party Government to the question of tourists, before the last general election. Before proceeding to a consideration of the Estimate proper, I would like briefly to refer to Deputy Lynch's remarks. Many of us did undoubtedly express the view that a tourist industry, to the extent that it resulted in our surrendering food, clothing and accommodation to cross-Channel visitors —and perhaps the recent visit of Mr. Maximoe was not absent from our minds—in return for pieces of paper with '£1 sterling' printed on them, was not an industry which was of paramount importance to the country. The only reason I refer to Deputy Lynch's remarks is lest anything he said should lead people in this House or elsewhere to believe that the people on this side of the House do not realise the value in dollar-earning capacity of a properly run and directed tourist industry. Having said so much, let me proceed to a consideration of the matters involved in this Estimate. The Minister, in his conclusion, requested Deputies to approach this Estimate and the cognate Estimates in the spirit that, although much has been done, much remains to be done, and, in that spirit and with that constructive approach, I hope to place certain considerations before the House. We are fortunate that so far, at any rate, in this debate we have had, in the main, a constructive approach by those who spoke. In any criticism I make of the administration of the Minister's Department, I should like him to realise that these criticisms are addressed to him in a constructive spirit and, as I told his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, are not criticisms merely for criticism's sake. I believe that between some of us who sit on this side of the House and the Minister there is a pretty deep philosophical chasm. The Minister and two or three of his colleagues make a fetish of free enterprise, of doing away with controls and a policy generally that, in the long run, if things are left [2096] to work out for themselves, they will work out for the best. That is a policy to which I do not subscribe and a policy to which the members of Clann na Poblachta do not subscribe. We believe in intelligent planning. I think it was Deputy Larkin who regretted the absence, or apparent absence, of any unified industrial and economic plan for the whole country. I may be told, and probably will be told, that it is premature to expect the emergence of such a plan. At the back of my mind, speaking perfectly frankly, is the fear that the Minister and his Department are afraid of being accused of following too closely in the steps of their predecessor. I am no apologist, and would never like to be taken as an apologist, for the Fianna Fáil Party, but I would say this to the Minister, that merely because, at some stage in their political evolution, the Fianna Fáil Ministry did entertain briefly, or embark upon or complete a particular line of action it would be wrong, in my estimation, to put it to one side purely for that reason. I am glad the Minister was able to tell us—it was a heartening thing which will give heart to our people as a whole —that there is a trend towards a reduction in our adverse trade balance. Our people will be heartened to know that there has been an increase in exports and a fall in imports. I am not going to be so mean or so niggardly of appreciation as to attempt to ascribe that to factors outside the Minister's control. In so far as he can report to us that progress has been made in that direction, the Minister is deserving of congratulation, and I for one will not withhold it from him. One matter to which no reference was made by the Minister—it is a matter which I think can be fairly described as relevant to the Estimate—is the position of these semi-State or statutory companies. On two or three occasions, by way of Parliamentary Questions to the Minister and also to the Taoiseach, I and some of my colleagues sought to elicit some indication of what future Government policy was to be in relation to these bodies. There is a rather impressive list of them, a rather impressive list [2097] of statutory, semi-State corporations receiving support out of public moneys and over which this House has no control. Every Deputy has from time to time been faced with the situation that, on behalf of a constituent or some body or group, he has been requested to redress a grievance in connection with conditions of employment or other matters in Córas Iompair Eireann, in the Electricity Supply Board, in Bord na Móna, in Aer Lingus, in Aer Línte, in Irish Shipping, in Mianraí Teoranta and all these companies which come under the designation of semi-State concerns.",25/05/1949,13,521,522,Party but I would say this to the Minister that merely because at some stage in their political evolution the,Fianna Fáil,Ministry did entertain briefly or embark upon or complete a particular line of action it would be wrong in my,Fianna Fáil,683145_6,,Party but I would say this to the Minister that merely because at some stage in their political evolution the Fianna Fáil Ministry did entertain briefly or embark upon or complete a particular line of action it would be wrong in my,Party but I would say this to the Minister that merely because at some stage in their political evolution the Ministry did entertain briefly or embark upon or complete a particular line of action it would be wrong in my,text823,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.227683992,-0.0056921,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.101101101,0.129129129,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
704794,611,14,90,"Committee on Finance. - Transport Bill, 1949—Committee Stage (Resumed).",21/02/1950,Mr. James (Junior) Larkin,The Labour Party,Dublin South,"It is very easy at times to be misled by sympathy. Frankly, I had a great deal of sympathy with Deputy Lynch's amendment until I started to ponder what we were being asked to do. Let us leave aside the question of the poor man's son and the opportunities for education and everything else and deal with this amendment as it is. The purpose of it is to get an increase of wages or salaries. I have every sympathy with men who are trying to do that, but I do not think this is the place to do it. We should bear in mind, when we talk of open competitive examination, that it is the passing of the examination that determines the salary. If we take away the value of that examination, we may be affecting in many ways the whole wages and salaries scale of the company. I have no objection to doing that, but, again, this is not the place to do it. It would be very easy in dealing with a measure like this to try to clear up the various odds and ends which may require it and I would agree, if there were not adequate machinery for doing that, that we should do it. But I think that neither Deputy Lynch nor Deputy Hickey would suggest that we should put in a clause that a particular section to the number of 70, 100 or 200 should be given an increase of wages. I think that Deputy Hickey, like myself, would be the first to object to that. But that is, in effect, what it is proposed to do. I think it exceptionally dangerous for an Assembly like this, which clearly cannot have a full knowledge of the facts or the background or of the possible repercussions on the whole system of wages and salary adjustments, to deal with this matter because we have sympathy with individuals, not realising that we may upset arrangements, not only of [398] long standing, but which require very difficult working out in practice. I do not represent clerical workers to any large extent, but in very many cases the basic factor in the fixing of wages for clerks is the type of examination passed. In so far as railway clerks are concerned, their prior and immediate claim in the fixation of salaries for a particular type of employment is the passing of that examination. If we insist that that particular status should be lowered by bringing men into the grade who have not passed an examination, whether we like it or not that will be used in future negotiations by the officials of the railway company against the men representing the clerical grade in Córas Iompair Éireann. I think we would all wish to avoid that. I think this particular case can be met along the lines suggested by waiving the age limit for this particular type of employee and creating a special clerical grade suited to their requirements, allowing for the fact that many of them are advanced in age and could not be expected, even if they had the opportunity, to go through an amended competitive examination, and also for the particular points in the salary scales to which they would be duly entitled to go forward. I think it would be as well that we should not try to solve this problem by embodying actual sections in the Bill because of the possible repercussions. If we proceed on that line, we are going to invalidate the status that the clerks in the company have attained, and part of that status consists in the fact that they passed a competitive examination. We are also going to place in that general clerical grade new clerical officers who quite clearly, if they have not been required to pass a standard examination, will in certain cases not be up to the educational requirements necessary to go to the top of that grade, and we will have various other complications arising in the future. I suggest that if we had an indication from the Minister that the matter would be brought by him to the attention of the company the matter could be adjusted between Córas Iompair Éireann and the organisations representing these men. That would [399] be a far better way to deal with it than to allow ourselves to be misled by our sympathy in this matter and, in trying to do what Deputy Lynch feels is justice to this body of men, undo the good work which has been done by other large bodies of men and organisations over a long period and, it may be, do an equal degree of injustice to employees in Córas Iompair Éireann.",21/02/1950,13,218,219,were not adequate machinery for doing that that we should do it But I think that neither Deputy Lynch nor,Deputy Hickey,would suggest that we should put in a clause that a particular section to the number of 70 100 or,Deputy Hickey,704794_2,,were not adequate machinery for doing that that we should do it But I think that neither Deputy Lynch nor Deputy Hickey would suggest that we should put in a clause that a particular section to the number of 70 100 or,were not adequate machinery for doing that that we should do it But I think that neither Deputy Lynch nor would suggest that we should put in a clause that a particular section to the number of 70 100 or,text245,1,1,1,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.251443203,-0.00628608,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.088088088,0.118118118,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

844541,666,9,8,Motion of Confidence (Resumed).,02/07/1953,Mr. Seán (Major-General) Mac Eoin,Fine Gael,Athlone-Longford,"Deputy Cowan would like to have attention drawn to himself. I am not going to assist him in that. Deputy MacEntee, the present Minister for Finance, said all the things about him that I could ever think of saying. I do not have to add to that. I want to address myself to these three constituencies—North-West Dublin, East Cork and Wicklow—for a vindication of the programme and policy of the inter-Party group. The majority of the electorate in all three constituencies voted in no uncertain fashion for that programme, yet Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll says that we are looking for a blank cheque. We are not. We do not want a blank cheque. We have stated specifically what our programme is. We will fulfil every promise that we have made. It is not like the 15-point programme: promises are no sooner made by the Government than they are broken. Yet Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll votes for that breach of the fundamental plank of his programme which was that the subsidies would be retained. We said in Limerick and in Waterford that we would restore the subsidies. Believe it or not, the people of West Cork, in Limerick and in Waterford said to me: 'The Government will not take them off.' Fianna Fáil supporters in Limerick City said to me: 'You are talking through your hat. If the Government win these by-elections you can take it that the subsidies [499] will not be removed.'

4177170,2319,8,50,Road Traffic Bill 2011: Second Stage,23/03/2011,Mr. Charlie McConalogue,Fianna Fáil,Donegal North-East,"I congratulate the new Minister, Deputy Varadkar, on his appointment. He faces a big challenge and I am delighted to see somebody as young as Deputy Varadkar in the Cabinet. During my election campaign I picked up from the public the need for new blood and an infusion of new people into politics. I am delighted to see the Minister in his new role although I am a little disappointed not to see more young members in the Cabinet we will also need experience in these challenging times. I wish the Minister well. As this is my first time addressing the House I will take the opportunity to thank those who worked so strongly for me in the constituency of Donegal North-East to ensure I was elected here to represent the area and work for its people as a representative at national level. I will work on the issues of importance to the constituency, driving them in the Chamber and ensur[419]ing there is progress. I will also make a contribution during this Dáil term to the big issues and challenges facing the country now. As it is my first time speaking, it is appropriate that I speak to the Road Traffic Bill 2011 because of where I come from. As we are all aware, Donegal is one of the areas at national level which has suffered disproportionately in this regard. I welcome Ms Susan Gray, who is in the Gallery, a founding member of the Public Against Road Carnage, PARC, road safety group. She is from my own parish and I have met her in the past. Like many other families in my local area and nationally, she has suffered loss due to a road traffic accident. She dealt with the issue by taking the initiative and working with other people to set up the PARC safety group to try to improve our road safety. It is a remarkable and commendable act. With the PARC group she achieved a petition signed by 40,000 people calling on the Government to introduce compulsory testing of people involved in road traffic collisions. Up to now if there is a fatality in a road traffic collision, certain people can be tested but others involved in the incident may not. A very important measure would ensure that the message would go out that drink-driving will not be tolerated. It is also important to ensure that those involved in incidents are tested in order to clarify where alcohol is not involved. The Bill will be key in allowing for the early introduction of the significant provisions in road traffic legislation to support and reinforce existing measures against drink-driving. The Road Traffic Bill 2011 amends existing legislation and the Road Traffic Act 1994 to allow for the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing of drivers involved in collisions in advance of the coming into force of sections 9 and 14 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 in September this year. The Road Traffic Act 2010, which was passed into law in July last year, introduced mandatory alcohol testing in specific circumstances, as well as a lower permissible blood alcohol count of 50 mg and 20 mg for novice drivers. Section 9 of the Act provides for the mandatory breath testing of a driver who in the opinion of a member of the Garda Síochána has consumed intoxicating liquor or been involved in a road traffic collision resulting in an injury. Section 14 of the Act, which is linked to section 9, provides for the mandatory testing of a driver of a vehicle involved in a road traffic collision where the driver is injured and removed to hospital. It provides that a member of the Garda Síochána shall test that driver in hospital unless, following consultation with a doctor, it is not possible. There is a close relationship between sections 9 and 14 with regard to blood-alcohol limit levels. Unfortunately, these sections of the Act were unable to be put in force as the evidential breath-testing equipment could not be recalibrated to the lower blood-alcohol limit of 20 mg per 100 ml of blood until September 20011. In this interim, the Road Traffic Bill we are currently discussing amends current legislation to provide for the mandatory alcohol testing at the scene of collisions, albeit within the constraints of the higher blood alcohol levels. The provisions of the Bill send a strong message that drink-driving will not be tolerated. Importantly, it also clarifies the powers of arrest conferred by law on the Garda Síochána. The legislation must proceed as quickly as possible to ensure no driver can avoid being tested for alcohol intoxication. I am particularly delighted, on that basis, that the Minister has put the Bill before the Dáil today, following the strong work done by the outgoing Minister for Transport. This will ensure that any gains made in changing driver behaviour following the passing of the Road Traffic Act last year will not be lost between now and September this year. This is the seventh major legislative initiative taken on traffic law in the past decade by various Governments. In the past ten years we have seen the introduction of the fixed charge and penalty points system, a new structure for speed limits based on metric values, the introduc[420]tion of mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints in 2006 and the reduction of blood-alcohol count levels for drivers from 100 mg to 80 mg in 2006. The Road Safety Authority was also established and there is a mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between this country and the United Kingdom. Last October a network of privately operated speed cameras was rolled out. The key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users. The primary focus of a road safety strategy has been to positively influence that behaviour, and this Bill is another element of that programme, which we should continue. I recognise that the Minister has recognised the work done by predecessors such as former Deputies Noel Dempsey and Martin Cullen. I congratulate the current Minister, Deputy Varadkar, on this and I hope he will manage to continue this success. The previous Minister, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, accepted the 2010 Road Safety PIN award in recognition of the outgoing Government’s successful and sustained strategy in reducing road deaths. The award was made by the European Transport Safety Council and marked an outstanding road safety programme among the 27 EU member states. I hope we will continue to build on that record. Speed remains a major cause of road traffic deaths and serious injuries. In November last, a contract was signed on the provision of safety cameras which appear to be operating successfully. Those of us who have received feedback on the use of such cameras will be aware of a degree of public annoyance caused by the issuing of fines for speeding. This is a sign that the system is working and indicates that drivers will take note of developments in this area. The focus of the operation of speed camera vans should be on ensuring they are in place for the greatest possible number of hours rather than on catching the greatest number of people. Recently, I encountered a case of an older person who had never before been fined receiving two fines within ten minutes while travelling to a shop to buy milk. A good appeals process must be in place to address such cases and ensure the system enjoys public confidence. The psychology and culture of speed is a key factor in road traffic accidents. While many measures have been introduced to address the behaviour of recently qualified drivers and improve driver education, I am not aware of many cases of inexperienced drivers causing road traffic deaths. Speed is usually the main factor involved in road traffic fatalities. The prevailing culture among a certain group of young people, specifically young men, is that those of them who have had repeated court appearances or received multiple fines enjoy a certain amount of street credibility. We need to focus on this issue. A person who is disqualified from driving for six months can engage in the same behaviour once his or her licence is returned and gain enhanced status among his or her peer group as a result. We should consider imposing on repeat offenders a requirement that they may only drive cars with low powered engines — perhaps 1. 0 or 1. 2 litre engines — for two or three years. This would address the problems arising from the ego aspects of driving at speed in high powered cars, while acknowledging the right of individuals to continue to drive. I welcome the measures in the Bill and commend the legislation to the House. I extend my best wishes to the new Minister and hope he will progress work in this area.",23/03/2011,31,6,7,I congratulate the new Minister,Deputy Varadkar,on his appointment He faces a big challenge and I am delighted to see somebody as young as Deputy Varadkar,Deputy Varadkar,4177170_1,,I congratulate the new Minister Deputy Varadkar on his appointment He faces a big challenge and I am delighted to see somebody as young as Deputy Varadkar,I congratulate the new Minister on his appointment He faces a big challenge and I am delighted to see somebody as young as Deputy Varadkar,text265,1,2,0,0,25,0.04,1,0.510825624,0.020433025,0.49,0.0196,0.738738739,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.636636637,0.95995996,0.972972973,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3621669,580,9,147,Leaders&rsquo Questions.,14/12/2005,Mr. Enda Kenny,Fine Gael,Mayo West,"It is important that the House record its thanks to Kieran Mulvey and his team from the Labour Relations Commission for arriving at a settlement in the Irish Ferries dispute, despite the fact that the Government, through the Taoiseach, said a number of weeks ago that nothing further could be done. While this will change the nature of social partnership, it is very important for the economy that this matter has been settled. I want to raise with the Taoiseach the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report on the PPARS debacle. The Taoiseach should examine the commentary of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of his Ministers and their Departments. The Comptroller and Auditor General identified a number of key issues concerning the debacle, which was first raised by me five months ago in the House. The report stated there was a failure to develop a clear vision and a void in decision making caused by the poor handling of the changeover from 11 health boards to the new Health Service Executive. This was explained to the Fine Gael parliamentary party by the chief executive, who said 3,000 of the administrators did not know what their jobs were. The report also stated there was an initial budget of €9 million which mushroomed to €195 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General stated both internal appraisals of the project fell short of the requirements of a full business case for the project. He said consultants were brought in on very generous terms, that there was no sharing of risk and that the State carried all the risk. A number of contractors were paid higher fees than the ones they tendered at and one recruitment agency, registered in the British Virgin Islands, was paid €2 million. Nobody seems to know who is involved in this company, who represents it and what it was paid for. At the end of seven years under the Taoiseach’s watch, the final cost, excluding that pertaining to voluntary health agencies, is €195 million. We are left with a system that caused [750]little or no redeployment. Additional resources are required for the system and, damningly, there is no evidence of staff savings having been achieved. It is five months since I raised this issue in the House on notice given to me by a concerned citizen. The issue is a scandal and has been discussed by the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on a number of occasions. The Taoiseach received the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and, in this regard, I would like to ask him three simple questions. Whom does he hold responsible for this debacle? Who is being held accountable for this litany of waste? What lessons has the Government learned from this episode?",14/12/2005,29,178,179,poor handling of the changeover from 11 health boards to the new Health Service Executive This was explained to the,Fine Gael,"parliamentary party by the chief executive who said 3,000 of the administrators did not know what their jobs were The",Fine Gael,3621669_1,,"poor handling of the changeover from 11 health boards to the new Health Service Executive This was explained to the Fine Gael parliamentary party by the chief executive who said 3,000 of the administrators did not know what their jobs were The","poor handling of the changeover from 11 health boards to the new Health Service Executive This was explained to the parliamentary party by the chief executive who said 3,000 of the administrators did not know what their jobs were The",text487,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,0.048666426,0.001216661,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.495495495,0.482482482,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2937350,5,8,65,Financial Resolution No. 9: General (Resumed).,04/12/1997,Mr. Bertie Ahern,Fianna Fáil,Dublin (Finglas),"Thank you, Deputy. Mr. Coveney: I will talk about the budget primarily as it affects agriculture, but I will make a few broad comments on it, particularly as I had the privilege of serving with Deputy Quinn in the Department of Finance. We should claim some credit that we handed over a set of books the like of which no Government has ever inherited. Given that, it is reasonable we should constructively criticise the steps taken by the Government to avail of the opportunities presented by what it inherited from the previous Government. It would be churlish of people not to welcome many of the excellent features of the budget. On the taxation side, the overall package is one that will bring satisfaction to many people and I do not want to take from that. We lost the argument about rates versus bands, but I find it difficult to comprehend that a person who will pay tax at 46 per cent does not realise how much better off he or she would be if there was a greater concentration on widening the bands. That would give a benefit of 22 per cent and not 2 per cent. Our strategy in Government, which we presented to the people, and would use if we were in Government now, would be to place greater emphasis on [300] personal allowances, to widen the tax bands and to reduce rates including the top rate. However, the Government has made a decision on this and it is for the people to judge it. Another serious concern I have about the budget is the way in which the Government dealt with public expenditure. It is continuing to delude itself and the nation that it is sticking rigidly to a 4 per cent increase, but that depends on what that 4 per cent is applied to. Our view would be that taking the outturn for 1997 without adding in the money brought forward out of 1998 and without including the rate support grant which does not arise in 1998, there would be a much lower base on which to apply the 4 per cent. However, by what has been described as different ways of playing around with the figures, the Minister has managed to create the impression that he is sticking to a 4 per cent increase. Some, although not many, commentators have seen through that, but there are dangers in that for the future. The proper addition for a realistic and correct 4 per cent increase would have been slightly more than a £500 million increase in expenditure while the real increase is in excess of £1 billion post-budget. That is a significant difference. While most Governments try to present their figures in the best possible light to suit themselves, this year's shenanigans with public expenditure has gone further than ever before and we are stacking up some difficulties for the future by dealing with public expenditure in that manner. If the hoped for reductions in interest rates arise from our entry into EMU, it is projected that over the next 12 months or so interest rates will fall by 2 per cent. That may not happen, but the likelihood is that it will. The combination of reducing interest rates, rapidly increasing public expenditure and giving a good deal in tax cuts, which nobody denies were due, will result in increased pressure and will tend to overheat the economy. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, might well finish up like Nigel Lawson by producing an attractive tax reducing budget, but the Minister's approach is dangerous because he has resisted the temptation to keep public expenditure tight. I will concentrate on the budget as it affects the agricultural community. The Taoiseach stated this is a good budget for the farming community. He talked about providing an increase of £23 million for headage payments, but that is not the truth. For reasons I do not understand, the Minister for Agriculture and Food seems to have been unsuccessful in convincing the Minister for Finance about the treatment of his Estimate. Although I was broadly critical of the excesses of this year's Estimates, it was extraordinary that, in such a climate, the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food dropped by about £22 million in real terms, that is, taking last year's base and adding 2 per cent for inflation. There were significant cuts, including a cut of £34 million in real terms in headage, £30 million on farm investment — the control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes, in particular — £5 [301] million in structural improvements — installation aid for young farmers — and £5 million in the TB and brucellosis eradications schemes. Some people may not know we are on the brink of losing our brucellosis free status so it is a strange time to cut back expenditure in this area. Those cuts totalled about £75 million in real terms in 1998 as against 1997. There were some increases but cuts under these specific headings seem especially inappropriate in the present climate. Yesterday, the Minister for Finance said he put back £23 million into headage. He did not, however, read out the postscript which said that £13 million of the £23 million will have to be found from other savings in the Department of Agriculture and Food. In fact, he gave back an extra £10 million and nobody has explained where the £13 million in savings will be found, although the Minister may do so in his speech next week. When those savings are found, will the £23 million be sufficient to fund the vital headage scheme for next year? To a large extent, we are speaking about the less well off sectors of the farming community who depend so much on headage. There are dangers ahead and for the Minister to say he gave back £23 million without mentioning that £13 million of it had to be found from savings in the Department was a bit of a sleight of hand. The failure to provide funding for the reintroduction of the control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes both of which, to a large extent, are mandatory on farmers at a time when farm incomes are dropping vis-à-vis the rest of the community and in real terms, was an unfortunate failure by the Minister, perhaps more on Estimate day than on budget day. In some respects, the budget dealt with installation aid for young farmers and £3. 5 million was provided for that purpose. It was, however, stated emphatically that it was to deal with applications in the pipeline without any commitment to the maintenance of the scheme after 1998. Young farmers are particularly cynical about this Government because of this issue which is small in relative terms. During the general election last June Macra na Feirme wrote to parties and asked them a specific question about installation aid. The main Government party, Fianna Fáil, replied in writing and stated unequivocally that not only would it maintain this scheme, but it would improve it. However, by 7 August it had eliminated the scheme. It is now half-heartedly reinstating it to deal with applications already in the pipeline. I spoke to young farmers last night and there is grave cynicism and disappointment about this. When one looks at overall budget figures, the mean way in which this issue was tackled by the Government is surprising and uncharacteristic of a party which has its ear to the ground in rural Ireland. On the control of farmyard pollution scheme, there is a tax measure in the capital allowances area which will help a little. Most farmers with [302] small and medium sized farms, who need to invest in the control of farmyard pollution scheme, cannot do so without some financial assistance from the State. A totally inadequate response was given in the agriculture Estimate to the request for funding to encourage this valuable scheme. The same is true of the dairy hygiene scheme which is mandatory on dairy farmers. Small dairy farmers cannot afford to undertake this scheme themselves. Small producers are living on the edge with falling incomes. The 1996 Teagasc survey on farm incomes indicated that 63 per cent of all farmers earn less than £10,000 per annum. People living in cities, who are generally critical of farmers and farm leaders who they believe constantly bellyache about issues do not appreciate the low incomes farmers earn. Offering capital allowances to small farmers, who are not in the tax net because of low incomes, will not allow them to invest in the control of farmyard pollution scheme, which they need to do. I welcome the extension of stock relief for young farmers from two to four years. I was disappointed by the response to the widespread demand from rural Ireland for some form of a rural renewal incentive scheme. I know from my time in the Department of Finance that such schemes are extremely difficult to design in a way which will target them at those who need them. Many schemes, including the urban renewal scheme, have been seized upon by smart accountants and have been abused. I welcome some of the steps taken on BES and capital allowances to redress that. However, we should not be discouraged from considering a scheme which would encourage investment in rural communities because there is no doubt that in the coming decade Irish and European farming will face the greatest threat to its existence. There is considerable pressure not so much from Brussels but from the World Trade Organisation in Geneva to force European farming into a market price related situation with minimum and temporary supports from the EU. That is a matter for another day, although we debated it last week. In such a climate and if we are serious about redressing the flight from the land which is causing chaos in our cities in terms of traffic and so on and protecting small to medium sized farm families, we will have to look at innovative ways outside mainline agriculture to encourage investment and job creation in rural areas because farmers will only survive as part-time farmers and will look for alternative work. A type of rural renewal scheme, rather than the lip-service paid in the budget to designing a pilot scheme in the upper reaches of the Shannon, will be required. One possible measure could be the renewal scheme embracing the idea of advanced factories in specified rural towns providing alternative jobs, part-time or wholetime, for farm families, although I can see the difficulty in ringfencing it to ensure it is not abused as some of these schemes have been in the past. [303] As far as farming is concerned, the budget attempted to redress the deficiencies of the Estimates in a minimal way. I referred earlier to cuts in the Estimates of about £75 million in real terms. Yesterday, the Minister gave back £13. 5 million, £10 million in headage payments and £3. 5 million in installation aid, having accepted cuts in real terms of £75 million in schemes essential to agriculture. It is not true, as the Taoiseach said, that the farming community has done well out of this budget. There are other interrelated difficulties facing agriculture. The Minister must do more than he proposed for grain farmers who have suffered serious losses in the south and south east. The Minister, having raised many expectations, devised a £1. 2 million package which excluded all tillage farmers who managed to salvage or harvest any of their crops and confined it only to those who could not harvest anything. Many farmers believed that if they did not make an attempt to harvest what in some cases were partially unharvestable crops, they would not qualify. Having done that, they are now disqualified. That is unfair and unreasonable. The Minister also attached a set of conditions at the eleventh hour stating that any other on or off farm income of any significance disqualifies farmers. The combination of both these factors has excluded the vast majority of farmers who suffered catastrophic losses as a result of weather in August, the likes of which none of us in the south can remember having seen before. Rain and high winds throughout the month wrecked tillage crops, especially the grain crops, in south Cork, south Waterford and Wexford. The Minister's response is inadequate. Given the problems in the UK which again highlight the problems of beef producers, the Government's failure to make any worthwhile progress on the export of live cattle, especially to the Middle East, has been extremely disappointing. It was an issue the current Administration made much of during the election. The Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Taoiseach gave a clear signal to farmers in letters they issued and in interviews that they would raise——",04/12/1997,28,575,576,cuts which nobody denies were due will result in increased pressure and will tend to overheat the economy The Minister,Deputy McCreevy,might well finish up like Nigel Lawson by producing an attractive tax reducing budget but the Minister's approach is dangerous,Deputy McCreevy,2937350_2,,cuts which nobody denies were due will result in increased pressure and will tend to overheat the economy The Minister Deputy McCreevy might well finish up like Nigel Lawson by producing an attractive tax reducing budget but the Minister's approach is dangerous,cuts which nobody denies were due will result in increased pressure and will tend to overheat the economy The Minister might well finish up like Nigel Lawson by producing an attractive tax reducing budget but the Minister's approach is dangerous,text922,2,3,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.336472237,0.008411806,0.122538259,0.003063456,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.585585586,0.580580581,0.633633634,0.600600601,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1900336,28,8,26,"Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1979: Fifth Stage.",17/07/1979,Mr. Sylvester Barrett,Fianna Fáil,Clare,"During my Second Reading speech on 27 June I referred to a notice which was inserted in the Press on 1 June about section 18 of the Bill. I said that it contained several inaccuracies and misleading statements. A further notice was inserted by the CIF on 4 July which also contained the same type of inaccuracies. The notice referred to my lack of consultation with the CIF about the Bill. As I have already stated in this House and to the press, there have been numerous meetings between the CIF and my Department since the Government came into office. At these meetings various, aspects of the CRV system were discussed and the CIF were informed that further discussion on specific provisions of the Bill could be held after it was published. I received a request from the CIF for a meeting at which they would give me their views. I replied that I was prepared to meet them and that firm arrangements for a meeting would be made as soon as they gave me details of the matters which they intended to raise. On 25 June I was informed by the CIF that they had nothing to add to their views already contained in the press notice. They chose instead to insert a further notice in the press on 4 July, notwithstanding the points I made to them. It is fair to say that the amendments passed will both strengthen the provisions of the section and ensure that builders are treated fairly. The notice says that the Bill will extend the CRV system to all new houses for sale. This is incorrect. The notice also says that the Bill will give my Department the power to decide the number and type of houses [2803] to be built by a particular building firm. This is also incorrect. Any regulations made under the Bill in common with all other regulations having the force of law must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will be the subject to a motion of annulment by either House. As soon as the Bill becomes law I intend to invite representatives of the CIF to discussions regarding the implementation of the revised procedures for the CRV system which will be necessitated by the provisions of section 18. As I have already indicated, I will go as far as I can to meet them, especially in regard to the question of giving reasons for refusals, where this is possible. It is certainly my intention that these discussions should not be prejudiced by what I referred to earlier and that they will be frank and fruitful. I should like to draw attention to a printing error in section 6 (2). The words 'contribution in kind' in line 4, page 6, were inadvertently hyphenated in the text of the Bill as initiated. This error was overlooked at the proofing stage and the words appear incorrectly in the text of the Bill now before the House. On Friday last I issued a statement giving details of a special house improvement grant of up to £600 to reduce dependence on oil. This Bill covers the making of these grants. The grant applies to the following works: conversion of oil, electricity or gas central heating systems to solid fuel systems the installation of a back boiler or other solid fuel burning appliance where a house has a fireplace but no back boiler the cost of replacing a fireplace or appliance or installing an additional fireplace or appliance is not reckonable for the special grants the installation of a fireplace or solid fuel appliance in a house which has central heating but no fireplace or solid fuel appliance in it the cost of installing a back boiler in such fireplace or appliance may be included in determining the amount of the special grant. This special grant is not subject to the normal limiting period of ten years for further grants. I need hardly say that this announcement has far-reaching implications for our energy policy. Let me say here and [2804] now in unequivocal language that, while I stand over everything I said on 13 June during the course of supplementaries to questions put down by Deputy Collins on this subject, at that stage our policy in the matter was being developed. Last Friday's statement shows that we have at least got the guts to tackle the oil problem head on. We are now determined to take a number of measures to reduce our dependence on oil. The latest announcement is a further important step in meeting this need. I now wish to bring the attention of the House to the fact that I do not propose to hold up the payment of any grants under this special scheme. After the Housing Bill becomes law section 5 will be brought into operation and regulations will be made under the section as soon as practicable. For the benefit of Deputy Horgan section 5 of the Bill covers these grants. Before I conclude I wish to thank Deputies Fitzpatrick, Quinn, O'Brien and Tully who were mainly concerned with the lengthy debates during the various stages of this Bill. The debate lasted some nine hours on Second Stage and 19 hours on Committee Stage. The Deputies that I have mentioned have generally adopted a constructive approach to the provisions of the Bill which reflected their own views and, in the case of section 18 and section 20, the views put forward mainly by the building societies and the CIF. For my part I have very carefully considered the observations made by Deputies and by outside bodies. It is of course impossible to reach agreement with all interested parties. For example the CIF described section 18 of the Bill as a draconian measure and at the other extreme Deputy Keating said that the CRV provisions were weak-kneed and cosmetic. In fairness to the CIF they indicated the changes they wished to have made. On the other hand, Deputy Keating spoke in vague emotive generalities which seemed to be designed to grab the media headlines at the time. But I failed to hear him make any practical suggestions as the other Deputies did. Any fair-minded Deputies opposite will accept that I have gone a long way [2805] towards meeting proposals for amendments. Essentially as amended the Bill provides a statutory framework for housing grants, loans and subsidy systems. The Bill also provides a flexible framework for a form of house price control which may be applied, modified or dismantled as is necessary.

1237464,228,14,181,Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 12: General (Resumed).,29/03/1966,Mr. Brendan Corish,The Labour Party,Wexford,"Towards the end of my contribution on Wednesday last, I was speaking about certain aspects of the NIEC Report and, in particular, about that aspect of the Report which referred to an incomes policy and to industrial relations generally. I should like to talk for a short while now on industrial relations and also about an incomes policy as recommended by and referred to in the NIEC Report. What I am concerned about is the deliberate attempt by certain people to discredit the trade union movement. The way many people talk one would imagine there was near anarchy in the country as far as industrial relations are concerned. [37] The trade union movement and the members of my Party, the Labour Party, would be the first to admit that there is a great deal of room for improvement in industrial relations. The trade union movement also concedes that, as far as its own association is concerned, there is need for improvement in the whole trade union structure. However, even with these admissions, I still think it is wrong — it does a great deal of harm as against the harm that may be done by unofficial strikes or by poor industrial relations generally — for people to try to represent the trade union movement as a movement that is near anarchy, as a movement wanting to disrupt the economy and as a movement which wants to stop the wheels of industry turning. Many people talk very loosely about wildcat and unofficial strikes without seeking out the facts. The Minister for Finance and, in particular, the Minister for Industry and Commerce are in a position to demonstrate to those who are concerned and to the critics of the trade union movement that we have not had a great number of wildcat and unofficial strikes in the past 12 months, and it is the past 12 months to which reference is usually made. Such strikes it will be found, I think, have been very few indeed, and only in some areas in the country. Whilst there is, as I say, a great deal of room for improvement in industrial relations and in the trade union structure, it is recognised by the various trade unions and by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that there is much more room for a change in the social and economic system since there must be some fundamental reason for the unrest. There must be a reason for the dissatisfaction that undoubtedly exists in certain sections of the community, particularly in those sections which are now being criticised for trying to improve their personal and their general position. Mark you, the Minister for Transport and Power in a good portion of his speech here last Wednesday quoted certain of the recommendations of the NIEC Report on the economy of the country. That Report was published [38] last November. The Minister took out sections and misconstrued many of them in an effort to give the impression that the NIEC Report was directed in the main to workers, advising them to show restraint in relation to their anticipated incomes in the coming year. I said, and I believe, that there is much more need for a change in the social and economic system of the country. That is borne out to an extent — not in respect of the whole economy — in paragraph 68 of the Report. In an objective way, the Council make some attempt to analyse the reasons for dissatisfaction in many respects. They talk about the dissatisfaction with the present personal distribution of incomes. It is a pretty valid point. They advocate that consideration should be given to the change I have suggested. They also talk about the grievances of wage and salary earners with regard to social and economic distinctions or inequalities in opportunities for advancement. They talk about the difference between economic and social security as between wage and salary earners. They also mention as a source of dissatisfaction the incremental scales applying to certain sections. We have heard much criticism about what we might term the unreasonableness of certain clerical workers who have sought service pay. They believe that in industrial employment and other work outside Government and local government employment where service pay is given automatically, the same situation should apply. There has been talk and criticism in regard to fringe benefits, pensions and compensation for loss of employment. All these things have been won and are being enjoyed by a certain section of the community and surely it is legitimate for those who have not got these advantages to seek them. That is all they have been trying to do during the past 18 months or two years. In their report, the NIEC recommend that these grievances should be removed. When the Minister for Transport and Power purported to quote the NIEC Report, he seemed to skip over the paragraphs in which the members of the NIEC pinpointed some of the grievances and the causes [39] of dissatisfaction among certain sections of wage and salary earners. It is thought unreasonable if trade unions seek to improve the position of their members, but these sections of the community are specifically mentioned in the November Report of the NIEC. I should again like to emphasise this point apropos the speech of the Minister for Transport and Power and the statements of other members of the Fianna Fáil Party during this debate. Lengthy statements were made in October, November and December last about an incomes policy and let me say it would be fair criticism to allege that as far as the Government are concerned, a wages and incomes policy should apply only to wage and salary earners, forgetting that the Report, to which I have referred a few times in my speech so far, specifically states that an incomes policy cannot and should not be implemented in respect of wages and salaries only. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport and Power apparently want the country to believe that a three per cent increase in incomes — wages or salaries — is the only portion of an incomes policy that ought to be applied now. There is no free advice from the Taoiseach or others in the Government for those whose incomes are derived from profits, from professional earnings or realised capital gains. I have not heard the Minister for Transport and Power or any Member of the Government say that an increase in incomes this year in all sectors should be confined to three per cent. I have not heard any warnings from the Minister for Transport and Power as to how the economy would be affected if there were more than three per cent earned as profits, professional earnings or capital gains in 1966 and 1967. I shall quote from the NIEC Report on the Economic Situation, page 42, paragraph 56: The position as regards other types of income is different from that of wages and salaries in that the method by which the principle is to be applied is less obvious, and [40] requires to be developed in further detail here. I think that is pretty valid. It is easy to apply it to wage and salary earners and relatively difficult to apply it to other sectors. The paragraph continues: It must be emphasised, however, that the difficulties in applying the principle to these other money incomes must not only be faced but also overcome. Incomes policy must be accepted as a whole and its application to all sectors must have equal priority and effectiveness. The measures relating to other incomes should be set out in advance by the government and applied to them contemporaneously with the application of incomes policy to wages and salaries. Therefore, the Government have a duty, if they wish to impose an incomes policy, to apply it to all sections of the community as well as to the wage and salary earners. Speaking here last Wednesday, the Minister for Transport and Power, reported at columns 2172 and 2173 of the Official Report, stated: I have made it perfectly clear — indeed, we all have — that we believe in a strong, constructively organised trade union movement. But we would like to see a general acceptance of the principles in the report of the National Industrial Economic Council on incomes, which principles are now universally accepted as authentic. We have gone further than that. Many of us have suggested that there should be more communication between employers and workers and employers should take workers more into their confidence in regard to their distributed profits, their levels of profits, so that workers will understand to what extent they are sharing in the prosperity of firms and to what extent shareholders are likewise sharing. We hear little about that from the Opposition. If there could be more propaganda for better communication between employers and workers and members of the Dáil could give practical suggestions as to how to bring that about and [41] encourage it, we would be getting a greater understanding of the implications of the incomes policy. I do not think that is valid comment on the Opposition as represented here by the Labour Party who, for many years, have been advocating not what the Minister advocated last Wednesday but what the NIEC advocated three or four months ago. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has been in the House for approximately the same period as I have, will agree that the Labour Party have been advocating this for years and years. We have talked about disclosures of information to workers that would induce them to give even more by way of production. We have always said it was a pity that steps were not taken to correct the situation whereby workers and employers seemed to meet only when in dispute. At column 2174, the Minister continued: We none of us are against workers' wages rising but, at the same time, it is just as well to be frank about what will happen. If incomes go markedly above what has been recommended by the National Industrial Economic Council, the workers will not gain any advantage. The rise will not help them. It will merely mean an increase in the cost of living that would not otherwise be necessary and the nine trade unionists and the employers on the Council have solemnly informed the people that, if there is an increase of ten per cent in incomes all round, the cost of living will go up by six per cent. That is what they have said. We warned the people of that. We have suggested that, if incomes go up excessively, the workers will not get any advantage out of that situation. That is one of the things that has not been accepted as yet. I do not know whether the Minister was being deliberately mischievous. Either he was or he did not read the NIEC Report properly. It is pretty well accepted that the inference by the Minister for Transport and Power is that wage and salary earners want ten per cent and if they [42] get it, the cost of living will go up by six per cent. I want to emphasise that the NIEC — represented by the trade unions, the employers and the Civil Service — said that would happen only if all incomes go up by ten per cent. But the inference by the Minister for Transport and Power is that the nine trade unionist members of the NIEC have advocated that there should not be an increase of any more than three per cent so far as wages and salaries are concerned. The members of the NIEC, through the trade union movement, have made their position very clear in the resolution they put to the trade unionists of this country at a conference held in Dublin on 19th or 20th January last in which they advocated that a maximum salary and wage increase of £1 should be sought. Therefore, I think it is wrong for the Minister for Transport and Power, either by inference or by innuendo, to forecast what may happen to the economy if workers get more than three per cent. If he had been a little more specific and talked about incomes all round and then went on to speak about what he considered to be the dangers to the economy, that would have been valid enough, but to try to pretend that the leaders of the trade union movement on the NIEC speak in another voice is dishonest, if that is the view the Minister intended to be taken from the remarks he made on Wednesday last. The Taoiseach in his speech said he felt frustrated when I gave the example of a three per cent increase in wages to a man with £10 per week as being represented by 6/- per week and to a man with £7 10. 0. per week as being represented by 4/9 per week. He went on to talk, not for very long I might say, to the effect that, if increases were to be given, the bigger increases should be given, to the lowerclass workers. There is an opinion in the trade union movement that that might be the general pattern but, if the Taoiseach believes that, he should contact his Minister for Agriculture immediately and make a proposal to him as to what the agricultural workers should get. I do not know whether Deputy James Tully has made any recent plea for the workers in the [43] rural areas but I am sure he is not as optimistic about the result and that the benevolent Agricultural Wages Board, or a certain section of it, or the Minister for Agriculture will automatically give a pound to those who are now in receipt of £7. 10. 0., £7. 15. 0., or £8, a week. However, we will see, but I am assuming that, if the previous practice is engaged in, the agricultural worker will be offered a very small increase indeed and nothing in relation to what the trade unions advise should be sought. In paragraphs 62 and 63 of this NIEC Report, there is a reference to tax evasion apropros the grievances of those in receipt of fixed wages or salaries, or in receipt of a fixed income. They make certain comments and certain recommendations as a followup to another recommendation made by a Government-established body in respect of collection of income tax and tax evasion. They say, in paragraph 62 of the November Report on the Economic Situation, 1965: The position in regard to professional earnings contrasts sharply with that of wages and salaries, where the possibility of tax evasion is generally negligible. We, therefore, draw attention to the recommendations in the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation, that there should be a statutory obligation on all who carry on a trade or profession to keep a correct record of business and professional transactions and that these records should be available for inspection by the Revenue Commissioners. There may not be concrete evidence of the justifiable grievances, particularly of those who contribute income tax under the PAYE system because, as we stressed before from these benches, under PAYE, there is no possibility of evasion in relation to those on fixed salaries and wages. But it was recognised by the Commission on Income Taxation that there was evasion and it does not seem to me that the Government made any strenuous efforts to minimise that evasion. Let me concede that two or three [44] years ago the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dr. Ryan as he was then, did introduce some measure to minimise tax evasion and that was given the wholehearted support of the Labour Party. It seems to me we still have this evasion, on what scale I do not know, but it is no excuse for a Government, a Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners to say that it would be too difficult or too expensive to track this down. There is one other ominous factor so far as income tax is concerned. Whether or not it is peculiar to this country I do not know. There seems to be a feeling among certain sections that, morally and legally, income tax evasion is all right. The Minister for Finance, and others as well, should take stronger steps and should make much more positive statements to the effect that if the Government pass a Budget Resolution or a section of the Finance Act to the effect that a tax will be paid on net income received or that this should be subject to a tax, that it is collectable legally, those who evade it in any way should be punished. There is a moral aspect of it which we cannot debate entirely in this House. I believe, in any case, that it is immoral to evade payment of income tax by devious methods even though the methods employed may be regarded as legal. I think it is morally wrong. We cannot legislate for morals here but the man on £6 per week has to pay his tax and it is collected from him by the Government through the employer. I believe that those who do not pay under the PAYE system should, as a moral obligation, apart from a legal obligation, be required to pay as well. The Taoiseach talked about income tax and said, in criticism of the Labour Party, that income tax was 7/6 in the £ ten years ago. He asked the irrational question whether anyone bemoaned the rate then, meaning, I suppose, the Labour Party and the Members of the Opposition who were then in Government. The Taoiseach should, and must, realise that ten years ago a big number did not pay income tax. But now the number being brought into the income tax net under PAYE is very considerable [45] indeed and is increasing. There seems to be no escape for persons in that category, particularly when one remembers that the single worker earning over £6 a week has got to contribute under PAYE. The single agricultural worker or the single road worker, when one has regard to his wages ten years ago, was not brought into the income tax net. That was the gist of our criticism of the income tax code when we put down our motion some years ago. The rate of income tax may have changed up and down in the past ten years but the income tax allowances have not changed substantially. That is the reason we voted against the proposal by the Minister for Finance in this particular Budget. I am sure we would have been much more sympathetic had there been better allowances in respect of married people and the other categories under the code. It seems, in any case, as far as this Budget is concerned and in respect of the various Fianna Fáil Budgets over the past number of years, that when they want money they are content to extract it in the easiest way, irrespective of the hardship that may be imposed. The turnover tax was the simplest method and so they just put a blanket 2½ per cent on everything. Similarly with the PAYE system. I want now to refer to something which I mentioned the last night I spoke here. It would appear that no consideration was given to a capital gains or capital receipts tax. Every time we raised that matter here we were told (1) it would get in no money for us this year or (2) the Government had no idea how much they would get from it. If they are getting a few tens of thousands of pounds in tax on mineral waters, surely it would be worth an effort to ensure that those people with capital gains or capital receipts would not be let off with the entire profits but would be liable to pay tax on them. When somebody outside this House mentioned this matter, the Taoiseach thought it a brilliant idea. It is typical of the Fianna Fáil Party that when a suggestion comes from this side of the House they think it has no merit at [46] all. We mentioned this matter about this time last year in our election manifesto and at elections before that again and we have advocated it in every Budget debate here. The Taoiseach did not think it was a good idea this year. If the Minister for Finance believes his Government will be here next year, he should bear this in mind as a source of revenue. Therefore, I strongly advocate that the Minister should give the matter serious consideration for inclusion at least in the Finance Bill. When they want a considerable amount of money, the Government are dependent on the old reliables — beer, spirits, tobacco, cigarettes, petrol, and so on. The Minister said that that would have the effect of increasing the cost of living by about 1¾ per cent but, with other factors which must be included, the cost of living will go up by about 3½ or four per cent. The Taoiseach always talks as if he were Simon Pure or Holy Joe. In his eyes, the Opposition have no worthwhile criticism to offer. He talks about the poor and dreary contributions from the Opposition on the Budget, with no suggestions: he calls it a negative approach by the Opposition. He talks about the dynamic forces within the Fianna Fáil Party and he criticises us for not making suggestions and for what he calls our 'negative approach'. If these were my own words, and not a quote, I know I should be criticised, abused and laughed at by members of the Fianna Fáil Party. In any case, I shall read it, for what it is worth: We are opposed to all the Resolutions which involve increased taxes on the ground that the Government should have avoided the need for increased taxes if they had made a serious effort to reduce administrative costs. Those are the words of the present Taoiseach who was then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as reported at column 75, volume 157, of the Official Report of 8th May, 1956. Is he proud now of that kind of criticism of the proposals of the then Minister for Finance on 8th or 9th May, 1956? [47] This, surely, is a negative approach: this, surely, is opposition for the sake of opposition. The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach must admit that the contributions from this side of the House on this Budget have not been purely in that sort of tone. The attitude, at that particular time, by the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Seán Lemass, was, in effect: 'It does not make any difference what proposals the Government bring in, we shall oppose them because we are the Opposition.' The members of the Fianna Fáil Party ought to remember that. The only defence the Government seem to have not alone on this Budget but on previous Budgets is: 'What would you do?', as if they expected any individual in this Party, or this Party as an entity, to frame an alternative Budget to the one framed for us now by the Minister for Finance, Deputy J. Lynch. The job of an Opposition is to criticise — not to oppose — as best it can and to make broad suggestions. We cannot be expected to know what the revenue would be from a 2d tax on, say, drinking glasses. Our function here is to criticise, to keep the Government on their toes, and to suggest, where we can, proposals — not detailed — for the raising of money, to point out where savings can be made and to draw attention to obvious methods of raising taxation without hurting people who cannot afford to bear these burdens. The Government now say, in relation to this Budget, that there is no positive approach by the Opposition. They cannot expect us, or any Opposition in any Parliament in the world, to frame detailed alternative suggestions to a Budget prepared by a Minister for Finance with the assistance, in theory, of 30,000 civil servants. The Labour Party have had a positive approach not alone to the matter under discussion but to many aspects of our economic and social life. I made pretty clear — again, I admit, not in great detail — what the view of the Labour Party was in regard to the establishment [48] of industry. These are not proposals which we have thought up this year. This is what we believe in. We believe that, while private enterprise can do a good and a big job in this country, it is not capable of doing the total job. For that reason, we say we expect the State to intervene. Again in this Budget, we have suggested the method in which the money available for agriculture should be distributed. We have given positive proposals there, as we have in regard to the establishment of industry. The Minister for Health — not in this particular debate — has given credit to the Labour Party for their proposals in respect of health. We went even a little farther in regard to health. Not alone did we indicate what health policy we wanted but we tried to cost it as best we could. We were not afraid to say that it should be financed, in part, by an extra contribution through insurance stamps by the workers and salary earners, where applicable. In one of his soft moments, some few years ago, the Taoiseach congratulated the Labour Party on the policy document on education which was produced, with all due respect to them, before that of either the Fine Gael Party or the present or the past Minister for Education. That document was comprehensive in the views and suggestions it contained. I think we have been positive in our approach as far as taxation is concerned. We supported the Government in the measures they introduced in relation to tax evasion. Our views on direct versus indirect taxation are pretty well known. We have complained many times about the increased incidence of indirect taxation. We are a Party who believe that the burden of taxation should not be placed on the backs of people who are not able to bear it. We do not stand for the sly and the mean manner of collecting tax on bread, cigarettes, tobacco and drink. We believe that where wealth is recognised, and where it can be proved, the people with that wealth should be asked to contribute in a greater proportion than people who are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. I do not think there is anything unusual or unreal in that attitude. [49] We should get away from this mean and sly method of imposing indirect taxation to which we have been prone in the past five, six or seven Budgets. The attitude of the Labour Party in respect of social welfare has also been positive. As demonstrated last year, we were prepared to support every single measure the Government brought forward in order to finance increases in social welfare. We have always told the various Fianna Fáil Ministers for Social Welfare that we will support the measures they bring forward, provided they are fair measures, to increase the insurance stamp contribution in order to give those in receipt of social welfare benefits some increases. The Minister for Industry and Commerce must concede that we were positive in our approach to price control. Within themselves, the Government would be forced to admit — no matter what they may think about the general question of price control — that, if they had taken our advice on price control about 12 months earlier, we might not now be in the economic mess in which we undoubtedly are. I know that the Fianna Fáil Party do not like price control but, ever since last July, they have been boasting that it has been effective. They have been boasting that the cost of living index figure has been stable since last May. Without giving absolute credit to the Price Control Act, 1965, the inference is there — and there have been positive statements from some members on the back benches — that the implementing of this Act has been responsible for the relative or actual stability in prices since last May. It does not make any difference what the Fianna Fáil Party think about the policy of the Labour Party. So far as the Trade Agreement was concerned, at least we were honest and direct in our approach. We appeared to be in the minority, and appear to be in the minority. We gave our reasons for thinking that the Trade Agreement should not be signed. We described what we thought would happen, and what we still think will happen, in respect of certain industries. We were [50] not codded into thinking—nor are we still — as the Minister for Agriculture believes, that the agricultural industry will reap enormous benefits from the Trade Agreement. For that reason we had a positive approach — or a negative approach in this case because we decided to oppose it — but we gave our reasons for that decision. We oppose this Budget not only for the increased taxes it imposes, but for the gloomy outlook it indicates. That is absolutely rampant throughout the speech of the Minister for Finance, and I assume that was the major speech for the Fianna Fáil Government. Above all, we oppose the Budget for the arrogant way in which the Government have presented it and attempted to defend it. The Fianna Fáil Party were happy over the past few years and they were boastful and arrogant. They were content to drift with the tide of favourable European and world conditions and now, when the tide has turned, they find themselves somewhat lost, and they pathetically ask the country and the Opposition: 'What went wrong?' If this were purely a Fianna Fáil Budget to be endured purely by a Fianna Fáil population, it would not be too bad, but unfortunately it is a Budget for the whole nation. Neither is Government policy for the Fianna Fáil Party alone, and I do not think anyone can say it has been an outstanding success. The Labour Party will continue to be critical, and we will continue to advocate our own policy, no matter how unreceptive or belittling the Taoiseach may try to be. In recent years he has poured scorn and abuse on the members of the Labour Party but he should remember that this Party have gained increasing support from the Irish people during the past two general elections and that is more than he can say for the Fianna Fáil Party.",29/03/1966,18,5025,5026,and the Opposition What went wrong If this were purely a Fianna Fáil Budget to be endured purely by a,Fianna Fáil,population it would not be too bad but unfortunately it is a Budget for the whole nation Neither is Government,Fianna Fáil,1237464_18,,and the Opposition What went wrong If this were purely a Fianna Fáil Budget to be endured purely by a Fianna Fáil population it would not be too bad but unfortunately it is a Budget for the whole nation Neither is Government,and the Opposition What went wrong If this were purely a Fianna Fáil Budget to be endured purely by a population it would not be too bad but unfortunately it is a Budget for the whole nation Neither is Government,text342,5,0,0,0,40,-0.125,-5,-2.397895273,-0.059947382,0.265612526,0.006640313,0.011011011,0.002002002,0.002002002,0.024024024,0.840840841,0.786786787,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3754657,1823,11,104,Adjournment Debate - School Closures.,06/03/2007,Mr. Paddy McHugh,Independent,Galway East,"I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the serious issue of the threatened closure of Seamount College, Kinvara. The saga surrounding Seamount College is well known to everybody. It is known to the Department of Education and Science and the Minister for Education and Science, and last week the Tánaiste visited the school and was apprised of the situation by the very active and professional committee running the campaign to retain the college. As I said, the facts are available to everybody and presented in a manner which is easily understood. Facts and figures have been put forward to show the need for this school now and in the future. The statistics are indisputable and it is, [168]therefore, incomprehensible that the Minister has not acted on this issue to date. A simple request was made to the Minister in the initial stages to create a mechanism for the enrolment of first-year students in Seamount College in September 2007. To date the response from the Minister has been stunning silence. That stunning silence is no way for a Minister to behave, especially when young people and the quality of the education they receive is at risk. The Minister is responsible for those students but to date has failed to live up to her responsibility. In the catchment area of Seamount College the CSO figures and primary school enrolments show growth of about 30% in the four years 2002-06. In time this growth will impact on secondary schools. Parents in the catchment area of Seamount College have been attempting to have it opened to boys and girls. The figures show there will be 600 boys and girls of secondary school age in the catchment area in three years’ time. Approximately 500 of these are already in the eight local primary schools. Under the ham-fisted approach adopted by the Department and the Minister, it has been suggested the children can be sent to neighbouring secondary schools. The enrolment statistics and capacity of the schools, namely, Calasanctious College, Oranmore, and Gort community school, have been studied. Taking into account the statistics relating to Seamount College, it is simply not possible for the latter two schools to cope with the numbers that must be accommodated. The population of the area is growing so rapidly that there will, even if Seamount College were to remain open, be a severe shortage of school places in as little as two or three years’ time. Even if the college is allowed to remain open and convert to co-ed, Gort community school needs to be expanded to cater for 1,000 students. Where do the Minister and the Department of Education and Science expect those children to find school places? Why close Seamount College? Gort and Oranmore have excellent schools but the places available are required by the children who live in both towns. The 600 children from the Seamount College catchment area are entitled to be educated in their locality. The Minister, her officials and the Government should act in order to ensure this happens. The only way it will happen is for a secondary school to continue to operate in Kinvara. The Minister and the Government are the only people who can facilitate this. The time for talking is over and the time for analysing figures has passed. The statistics are stark, the figures add up and the numbers are there all that is missing is Government action. Government thinking in respect of this matter is worthy of attention. On his visit to the school last week, the Tánaiste stated the situation was unacceptable. This leads one to believe that the Fianna Fáil wing of the Government is intent on [169]closing the school. We need clarification in respect of this matter. If the Tánaiste is in favour of the school’s survival but cannot bring it about, are we to believe the Progressive Democrats has no influence within the Government? The Progressive Democrats promises in respect of this issue are of no use. We need that party to demonstrate that it has influence within the Administration by bringing about a Government decision to save the school. The Fianna Fáil wing of the Government can avoid being forced into action by the Progressive Democrats by making the decision to save the school before the latter exerts pressure. The Government parties should not play politics with this issue. The children, their education and their futures are too important and the situation too serious to allow anyone to play politics. I plead with the Minister to show that she cares, to live up to her responsibilities and to immediately move to save Seamount College.",06/03/2007,29,657,658,survival but cannot bring it about are we to believe the Progressive Democrats has no influence within the Government The,Progressive Democrats,promises in respect of this issue are of no use We need that party to demonstrate that it has influence,Progressive Democrats,3754657_3,,survival but cannot bring it about are we to believe the Progressive Democrats has no influence within the Government The Progressive Democrats promises in respect of this issue are of no use We need that party to demonstrate that it has influence,survival but cannot bring it about are we to believe the Progressive Democrats has no influence within the Government The promises in respect of this issue are of no use We need that party to demonstrate that it has influence,text363,0,3,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.945910149,0.048647754,0.118490544,0.002962264,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.937937938,0.884884885,0.613613614,0.584584585,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3476147,212,9,104,Garda S&iacute och&aacute na Report: Motion (Resumed).,16/06/2004,Mr. Paul Connaughton,Fine Gael,Galway East,"Where is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? I do not wish to show disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, but on an issue of this importance the Minister should be present. It is not enough that he should come in, deliver what he has to say and then buzz off. That arrogance is what is wrong with the Government and is why it got the works at last week’s local and European elections. The Government is so arrogant it believes it knows everything. The Minister should be sitting opposite us during this debate. This is the national Parliament conducting a national debate on crime and the Garda Síochána. He should be present to listen. The electorate bought into the promise made before the most recent general election by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that 2,000 extra gardaí would be recruited. We cannot blame it for buying into the promise because people knew there were not enough gardaí on the beat. What the public did not know was that the Government did not have the slightest intention of appointing 2,000 extra gardaí. The Government was reacting — something it was good at until last week — to the research analysis and the private opinion polls which informed it that this was something the electorate wanted to hear. However, the Government was not in office a week when the Minister for Finance decided to [804]place a bar on recruitment. This happened in the first week of the new Government. There was nothing the public could do about it at the time but having waited two years, the people delivered their verdict when they got the chance. One of the most important elements of a democracy such as ours is that every Member of the Oireachtas owes it to the electorate to ensure that every man, woman and child can go about their lawful business day or night without being mugged or kicked around by drunken louts who appear on the streets of every town and village, especially at weekends. This problem of offences against the person has created fear and anxiety in society. Deputy Perry was right about the crime figures. The Minister was at pains to point out decreases in the figures and there was an overall drop. However, he did not point out the figures for crimes that are not reported. Where can crimes be reported late at night? For example, a small town with a few hundred youngsters in it, the majority of whom are sane and responsible, may be infiltrated by the louts about whom I spoke, thereby giving rise to mayhem. The result is one or two gardaí in a squad car at 2 a. m. or 3 a. m. trying to control 200 or 300 people. It is an unfair battle the gardaí cannot win. The reason people are afraid is that when they go out about their business, no gardaí in uniform can be seen as they would expect. Gardaí on the beat are the only visible sign that the State has the security of the people and the community at heart. 8 o’clock I do not want to be personal about this issue. However, I have never yet seen a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with such hindsight as this Minister. The vision he has in hindsight is wonderful. When it comes down to brass necks, this Minister would do justice to a brass monkey. There is no question that this man has the answer to everything but it is not happening on the ground. There are areas of the country where if something is not done very quickly, there will be an even more hostile reaction at the next poll because this is what people want.",16/06/2004,29,367,368,town and village especially at weekends This problem of offences against the person has created fear and anxiety in society,Deputy Perry,was right about the crime figures The Minister was at pains to point out decreases in the figures and there,Deputy Perry,3476147_4,,town and village especially at weekends This problem of offences against the person has created fear and anxiety in society Deputy Perry was right about the crime figures The Minister was at pains to point out decreases in the figures and there,town and village especially at weekends This problem of offences against the person has created fear and anxiety in society was right about the crime figures The Minister was at pains to point out decreases in the figures and there,text618,6,2,0,0,40,-0.1,-4,-0.955511445,-0.023887786,-0.600832755,-0.015020819,0.018018018,0.006006006,0.152152152,0.16016016,0.005005005,0.028028028,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3939517,1028,9,90,Child Protection: Motion (Resumed).,28/01/2009,Mr. Alan Shatter,Fine Gael,Dublin South,"The Minister of State who was appointed only last May said: 'I became acutely aware that communication difficulties, deficits in information and the absence of standardised procedures can impede service responsiveness with potentially serious consequences for some children.' Why did none of his predecessors discover that was a problem? How long will it take to put that right? I greatly regret that this House will divide on this motion and that we have terms of reference that are widely acknowledged to be inadequate. The independent chairperson — she is independent, unlike two of the other people appointed — has said that if the terms of reference do not work out, then she will have them extended. We should have terms of reference that are so comprehensive that the group appointed to conduct this investigation is able to cover all areas and know its remit from the start, and not be inhibited in the work it does. If need be, the group should be able to subpoena people to attend before it to give evidence so that we can ensure the full story of this is known. That will not happen. The sad reality is that whatever report is produced by this group, there will inevitably be a need for a further investigation. It is unfair to the family and the children involved. It is unfair to children across the country who may be at risk tonight. It is unfair to the general public and it is contrary to the public interest that we have two forms of investigation that go on endlessly. [890]I urge the Minister to change his mind, to accept the motion before the House and let the commission of investigation proposed by Fine Gael be formulated, so that it can get on with its work.

4025231,2028,10,90,Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy.,04/11/2009,Mr. Eamon Ryan,Green Party,Dublin South,"On behalf of the Green Party and my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who cannot be hear this morning, I want to pay our respects to Joe Doyle and to extend our sympathies to his wife, Peggy, his daughter, Róisín, and sons, David and Michael. I had the great fortune of knowing Joe Doyle. I served on the city council with him for five years. Three thoughts came to my mind when I thought of how I would describe him. He was a man of standing. I mean that literally in describing the way he would speak. He spoke in a clear and proper manner, confident in his honesty and views, even if they were not popular or the views of the day. He stood and spoke in a way that had real authority and standing. He was a man of physical stature in how he stood and spoke in a council chamber where I saw him speak. He smiled a lot. He smiled at his own humour. I recall one simple incident. There is a very nice small council housing development in Ranelagh. He made some quip to the effect that if one got in there, one would have already got to heaven. He kept smiling after he made that nice quip. He had a good sense of humour. He was also very successful. I was the director of elections for Minister Gormley’s campaign in 1989. Joe achieved quite a trick, his constituency was divided between him and Garret FitzGerald. Joe was very much part of the team but still his own man. For his party to win two seats in a very tight election was a remarkable achievement. He was also a successful and capable councillor and Lord Mayor, as I witnessed. I had the fortune to join the council when he became Lord Mayor. He worked with the county manager, the council and the officials in an effective way. One could do a deal with Joe Doyle. As well as being a man of principle and [607]standing, he also knew how to work and to do what politicians do, namely, to seek compromises and solutions. On behalf of our party, I want to mark that huge public service he gave and to honour the man.",04/11/2009,30,5,6,On behalf of the,Green Party,and my colleague the Minister for Environment Heritage and Local Government Deputy Gormley who cannot be hear this morning I,Green Party,4025231_1,,On behalf of the Green Party and my colleague the Minister for Environment Heritage and Local Government Deputy Gormley who cannot be hear this morning I,On behalf of the and my colleague the Minister for Environment Heritage and Local Government Deputy Gormley who cannot be hear this morning I,text190,0,2,0,0,24,0.083333333,2,1.609437912,0.067059913,-0.102062073,-0.004252586,0.931931932,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.95995996,0.209209209,0.172172172,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
641423,626,8,90,"Committee on Finance. - Vote on Account, 1948-49.",09/03/1948,Mr. Seán F. Lemass,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South,"I will not argue about a point or two—say 96 per cent. or 98 per cent. The Labour Party of this country is in a unique position in comparison with all other Labour Parties in the world in that it is committed to retrenchment in Government Departments. Of course, they said that they joined the Government because, by doing so, they were going to fulfil their election pledge to promote a policy of full employment— and they start off by sacking employees in Government Departments for the sake of economy. The alternative is reducing their salaries or wages. Such a course would not be justified. On the contrary the time has come when a further revision of the wages and salaries of Government employees is necessary. So far as the Minister for Finance considers himself bound by the pledges of his predecessor, he is bound to do so. The wages and salaries of civil servants were established by agreements made with the Civil Service organisation which were, I think, based upon a cost-of-living index number of 175. It was understood that they would again be reviewed if the cost-of-living index number rose above 310. I am not quite clear of the details of the agreement but that, I think, was its main feature. There is, therefore, an obligation on the Minister for Finance to enter into discussion with the Civil Service organisations for an upward revision of the scales of salaries of civil servants which were established under the agreement made at the end of 1946. I am assuming, therefore, that the economies in Government Departments will not be secured with the assent of the Labour Parties through cutting down on the salaries of civil servants and the wages paid to workers employed by these Departments, and that if there are to be economies they must be secured by dismissing a number of the officials or men employed in those Departments. You are committed to economies. Deputies cannot make pledges like that [241] to the public and then forget all about them. As the Minister for Finance to-day has reiterated his determination to pursue a policy of retrenchment and economy, then in so far as it is true to say that 98 or 99 per cent. of the direct expenditure of Government Departments goes out in wages and salaries to individuals, any economy must clearly mean either a reduction in the amount paid to the individuals or a reduction in the number of people to whom wages or salaries are paid. As things stand at the moment, it appears that the Labour Party's programme of full employment is to begin by fairly widespread dismissals from the public services. I want to refer now to another matter, which affects me to perhaps a greater extent than others, that is, the announcement of the suspension of the commencement of the transatlantic air service. I would like if possible to discuss this matter in a non-controversial way but I was not helped in doing so by being inveigled into buying a publication of the Labour Party—am I right?—which I saw advertised in Dublin last week. Let me say something about that, incidentally. I purchased this journal because I saw a newsvendor with a contents poster announcing the appearance in the journal of the full story of why the American air service was held up. I understand that there is a regulation in force, for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible, which prohibts periodicals from publishing contents posters. All other periodicals are apparently required to conform to that regulation but, for some reason——",09/03/1948,13,17,19,I will not argue about a point or two-say 96 per cent or 98 per cent,The Labour Party,of this country is in a unique position in comparison with all other Labour Parties in the world in that,The Labour Party,641423_1,,I will not argue about a point or two-say 96 per cent or 98 per cent The Labour Party of this country is in a unique position in comparison with all other Labour Parties in the world in that,I will not argue about a point or two-say 96 per cent or 98 per cent of this country is in a unique position in comparison with all other Labour Parties in the world in that,text943,1,1,0,1,36,0,0,0,0,0.185933936,0.005164832,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.736736737,0.713713714,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4012567,2009,9,137,National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed).,23/09/2009,Mr. James Bannon,Fine Gael,Longford -Westmeath,"This is probably the most important debate we will ever have in this House. My sense that I am participating, however unwillingly, in the greatest gamble in the history of the State is mind-blowing. We have all heard of the great confidence trickster immortalised in song as 'the man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo'. We are now seeing the man who broke the Irish economy attempting to hedge his bets in a similar fashion with no guarantee of success or even luck. Gambling with other people’s money is shocking in any context. Gambling with the money of 4. 3 million people, many of whom exist below or just above the poverty line, is horrifying. These people would be unwilling participants in what could be the financial disaster to end all disasters if NAMA goes ahead in its present form. Unless some Government Members come to their senses it will go ahead by sheer weight of numbers and a few will be protected at the expense of many. I am disappointed that there are no Green Deputies in the Chamber this evening to listen to what people on this side of the House have to say. They will walk in blindfolded to vote with the Government on this issue and the people will walk them out of office at the next general election. While I do not wish to use unparliamentary language, a cartoon in a recent issue of a well-known magazine depicting the Minister for Finance saying 'Screw the public and save AIB' sums up the public’s opinion of NAMA which leaves many people feeling disenfranchised and helpless. Three quarters of the Irish people either reject NAMA or doubt that it can solve our financial difficulties. For many there is the real fear that their lives will be financially ruined by one tax and levy after another, not to get the country back on its feet but to bolster the position of banks, property speculators and the grasping beast that devoured the wealth of the Celtic tiger. They fear that those who attacked the foundations of this State for their own gain will be bailed out once again to the detriment of hardworking taxpayers. They fear a repeat of the cronyism that was and still is rife in Fianna Fáil, and that brought the country to its knees. This was the cronyism born in the Galway tent where the power and confidence of those same developers and speculators led them to claim they had more influence on Irish politics than [93]Ministers have. Alarm bells are ringing throughout the length and breadth of this country and trust in the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government has declined greatly. The frightening signs of the double whammy that is about to be unleashed on the Irish taxpayer represent not only a betrayal of trust but a confidence trick by the Government that exceeds all others. While taxpayers worry about paying for the crippling debt NAMA will impose on them, the very banks they will assist are, with Government collusion, lining up to stab them in the back by way of higher costs and interest rate hikes in the offing. This is already happening. Yesterday one heard reports that interest rates will rise again. There is no end to the Government’s duplicity on this. How many Deputies sitting on the Government benches can look their constituents in the eye and assure them that NAMA will be a fair and open solution to the financial mess their Government got them into? How many can explain why some of the best economic brains have come out against it? How many will vote for the good of their constituents and their country rather than shore up the Fianna Fáil and Green parties? We must consider how this will bear on our population. Will the bankers and speculators plough money into repayments to make good their debt to our society? I think not. It is an historical fact that Fianna Fáil Governments attempt to make good their losses on the backs of the poor of this country. This occurs, while those responsible for massive financial meltdown escape to prosper again after a short period. The poor get poorer and the balance of power remains with the wealthy, the grasping and the corrupt. I wonder just how many Fianna Fáil Deputies will benefit from NAMA because I know many of their card-carrying members up and down the country will so benefit. This is scandalous and disgraceful. It is shocking to note that figures for 2007, the most recent statistics available for salary scales in this country, show that in that year 33% of employees earned less than €25,000, namely, just under 500,000 workers. Given the impact of Government mismanagement of our resources, we know that figure has risen dramatically in the two years since these figures were compiled. The Minister should balance that statistic with the demands now being made on lower earners whose wages are just over the poverty line. Those earning as little as €15,000 are being asked to give up what they cannot afford to bail out the banks and the dodgy developers, although 'asked' is the wrong word —'forced' is more apt. This legislation has as many holes in it as a small child’s knitting. It is full of dropped stitches, and is of grubby appearance and sticky texture. Like the small child who asks us to believe that all will turn out all right in the end, the Government assures us it can be trusted on this and will produce the goods for us. That trust is noticeably absent across the country. When over three quarters of the population have no faith in NAMA, where does that leave a Government that still insists on pushing the legislation through by sheer force of numbers? That is if those numbers are there at the final hurdle. If the Green Party has any guts it will walk away. Speaking of numbers, this legislation is not the product of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet working in conjunction with the best economic brains in the country. It results, rather, from the extraordinary decision of the Government to rely solely on the judgment of one man. This is the man who is calculated to send shivers down the spines of every man, woman and child in my own county of Longford. When he was asked to produce a strategy report on the economic development of the county, Dr. Peter Bacon earnestly assured us that one of the major problems for County Longford was that it was under threat from serious coastal erosion. How can the Taoiseach or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs expect this country——",23/09/2009,30,663,664,money into repayments to make good their debt to our society I think not It is an historical fact that,Fianna Fáil,Governments attempt to make good their losses on the backs of the poor of this country This occurs while those,Fianna Fáil,4012567_3,,money into repayments to make good their debt to our society I think not It is an historical fact that Fianna Fáil Governments attempt to make good their losses on the backs of the poor of this country This occurs while those,money into repayments to make good their debt to our society I think not It is an historical fact that Governments attempt to make good their losses on the backs of the poor of this country This occurs while those,text162,3,2,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-0.336472237,-0.008411806,0.007905694,0.000197642,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.232232232,0.232232232,0.441441441,0.435435435,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3658072,250,9,43,Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006: Second Stage.,06/04/2006,Mr. Simon Coveney,Fine Gael,Cork South-Central,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage to outline some of my ideas and concerns in respect of the energy market, of which some the Minister of State may already be aware. I hope he and his advisory team will take note of my contribution. My first criticism has been outlined by other Opposition spokespersons, that is, the lack of a Government energy policy document setting out targets and requirements for the energy market in the short, medium and long terms. Instead, we have piecemeal policy development. In 1999 in the alternative energy sector alone, there was a Green Paper on sustainable energy and, in 2000, there was a consultation document entitled Options for Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets and Programmes. In 2004, we set up a renewable energy development group to essentially start all over again. We have had consecutive alternative energy requirement or AER programmes, of which any realist would recognise that the first four were absolute failures. They did [1977]not result in the type of wind energy development anticipated. I accept the recent AER programmes have been successful. Most recently, there has been a welcome development in subsidies for domestic grant schemes for greener homes, but it is a piecemeal approach. More broadly within the energy sector, consultations have taken place with a range of different bodies and interest groups. However, nine years after the Government entered office, there is still no overarching policy document. Ireland must be the only country in Europe that does not have one and is certainly the only country in Europe that has a nine year old Government without a coherent overarching energy policy. It remains to the CER to deal with all of the complexities and significant challenges of the marketplace. I accept there are no easy answers. The energy climate is constantly changing and, while some issues remain consistent, the factors influencing any overarching policy document for Ireland are also changing. Two years ago, I was Opposition spokesperson in this sector and, even in those two years, the goalposts have shifted somewhat. Energy is a policy area of discussion in the European Parliament and has rapidly moved up the priority list. A number of factors affect all states within the European Union. In the past three years, we have moved from $35 per barrel of oil to almost $70 per barrel and the price is fluctuating between $60 and $70. In the long term, it will really only move in one direction. Security of supply is perhaps the most significant political issue relating to energy in the European Parliament at present. Countries such as Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are exerting tremendous pressure to try to reduce the European Union’s existing reliance on Russian gas. At present, the European Union imports 55% of its energy fuels and by 2025, it is estimated that this figure will be closer to 75%. This is movement in the wrong direction. EU policy encourages member states to become more self-sufficient in energy and to move away from the importation of carbon fuels, particularly oil and gas. Moreover, all member states have commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and I intend to discuss Ireland’s lack of response in that regard shortly. In addition, environmental commitments have led the European Union to discuss and support alternative fuel sources and to find ways in which it can provide direct financial support to them. Factors specifically affecting the Irish market are somewhat more complex. First, there is a lack of competition. Deputy Kelly spoke as though we have successfully opened and liberalised the Irish marketplace to the extent whereby every energy supplier in Europe wishes to compete here. That is an extremely naive position to take. While we have gone through the motions and have made an effort to open up the Irish market to competition, it has not come. Although consumers and particularly businesses have some choice, it is still [1978]limited. In effect, the ESB still enjoys a monopoly of supply of electricity and power in Ireland. Moreover, the restrictions imposed on the ESB in an effort to try to promote competition mean that potentially, we have the worst of both worlds. As we do not permit the ESB to expand and increase its generational capacity in an effort to introduce competition, we are in danger of having insufficient capacity. Potentially, we may not provide sufficient power to the growing Irish economy as a consequence of failing to attract competition to fill the space which would be filled by the ESB, if it was allowed to so do. High demand has led to high prices and that factor, combined with the increased cost of gas and oil has meant that costs are rising dramatically for Irish consumers and business operators. This makes Ireland less competitive than it ought to be, relative to other parts of Europe. As an island, Ireland is an isolated marketplace and I welcome this Bill’s attempts to create an all-Ireland market. It is an obvious step and has not happened before time. However, even with the creation of an all-Ireland market for energy, Ireland will still be a small player isolated by the sea. The interconnection capacity between Northern Ireland and Scotland is small and insufficient. If we seriously intend to significantly expand wind energy projects in Ireland, our grid can only handle significantly more power from wind generation if we have significant interconnection capacity. This is because by its nature, wind is an inconsistent source of supply and although better wind speeds and consistency can be achieved in Ireland than in most other European countries, one still needs a substitute source of energy when the wind is not blowing. Until such a substitute source of energy can be obtained through interconnection and until that interconnection is used to export green energy produced in Ireland — it has a natural competitive advantage to so do with its wind speeds — we will never maximise our potential as far as wind energy is concerned. Ireland is incredibly vulnerable to imported fuel inconsistency and at present, it imports approximately 87% of its fuel requirements. It is the end of the line in the European Union, with respect to gas pipelines and, potentially, the supply of oil. Ireland is on the western coast and most energy comes from eastern Europe. Hence, if the supply runs out, Ireland will probably be the first country to suffer. Although we should be aware of this, little is being done to address this issue. From a positive perspective, as I stated earlier Ireland has a significant natural competitive advantage as regards renewable sources of supply in that its wind speeds are better than anywhere else in Europe. From an efficiency perspective, approximately 40% can be achieved from wind turbines here. In other words, 40% of the time, one can take acceptable amounts of power from wind turbines in Ireland. In most other European [1979]countries, that figure is closer to 35% and falls to 30% in some regions. Ireland also has an advantage in that at present, the EU, of which it is part, actively tries to support renewable energy and has encouraged the Irish Government to take initiatives in this regard. Unfortunately however, Ireland has not acted on this encouragement. Moreover, one can point to a change in the Irish mindset. People are more aware of our responsibilities regarding the environment and are more aware that alternative and renewable energy sources are no longer pie in the sky. This is no longer exclusively concerned with the environment as it is also about economics. Hence, groups such as IBEC, as well as business leaders have become engaged in pushing alternative energy sources. It is no longer simply a Green Party issue. While I intend no disrespect to the Green Party, from a policy perspective, this is the area on which it focuses. What is the way forward for Ireland? I wish to discuss interconnection in more detail because it is critical in a wide range of areas. Despite Deputy Crowe’s comments, we are moving towards a common European energy market, and rightly so because we live in an internal market in which jobs, people and goods move freely between countries and borders. This is encouraged to promote more competition, opportunities, business activity and so on. Hence, energy should also move between European countries. If Ireland is to participate in this regard and is to have the security which this would provide, it requires proper interconnection. Hence, from the perspective of security of supply, this is absolutely essential. The Government would claim that several years ago, it announced that it was open to the development of an interconnector between, for example, Wicklow and Wales and that it invited private sector interests to build it. This should be built and paid for by the State. It is fundamental infrastructure like roads, airports and railway stations. Moreover, the present electricity grid in Ireland is also fundamental, and should be kept in public ownership if the ESB is ever privatised. We cannot afford to wait for an entrepreneur to finance this project. The State must do so immediately and regardless of whether it costs €200 million, €300 million or €400 million, it would be money well spent because of the significant costs to the economy if this is not done. Hence, we should invest in this project without delay. We require a balanced energy mix in Ireland. I do not advocate the proposition that Ireland should be entirely energised by renewable sources. However, although gas and oil have roles to play, renewable energy should be part of the energy mix. Although some people may not agree, coal also has a role. It contributes to the security mix as the broader one’s mix of sources, the more secure one’s overall power generation will be. Nevertheless, we grossly under estimate [1980]the potential of renewable resources, particularly in the new, high cost environment for carbon fuels and for gas and oil in particular. I will focus on wind power in some detail. Ireland’s capacity to generate power for ourselves and for other parts of Europe is highly significant. Any economist would agree that it makes sense to concentrate on the areas in which one is competent. By any calculations, in the purest sense, Ireland should be very good at producing energy from wind. It has higher wind speeds, and more importantly, more consistent wind speeds on the west coast, than anywhere else in Europe. However, we do not appear to see this as the kind of opportunity that we should. Until the interconnector issue is sorted out, this discussion is futile as we can only reach a certain capacity within the Irish grid for an inconsistent source of supply. We should be planning for other aspects such as the cost of grid connection. The Minister of State will be aware that the cost of grid connection for a farmer, or a consortium of farmers who are putting together an ambitious wind energy project is nothing short of scandalous. It could cost hundreds of thousands of euro after a landowner has put a similar amount of money into a planning application to get connection to the grid, which is sometimes not far away. People have asked the legitimate question whether ESB subsidiaries pay the same costs for advice and grid connection when setting up wind farms in parts of the country for which they have been given contracts. Energy crops in Ireland are an exciting new opportunity for farmers. They can be a competitive fuel source. They are secure and predictable. They can be grown on a contract basis, as was the case with sugar beet, and they should be promoted. European Commissioner Fischer Boel wants to promote this area. She is willing to increase energy crop subsidies and change the rules so that they can be grown on set-aside land. However, there should be a response from the Irish Government on excise duty, as is the case in other European countries. We are being encouraged to do this by the European Union which is giving a definite competitive advantage to this industry. The Minister of State will get a very positive response from the farming sector if he provides it with a new crop which is financially viable. The EU will require Ireland and all other countries to have a 5% ethanol content in all petrol from 2010. How is Ireland planning for this? Ethanol is not being produced in Ireland at present or, if it is, it is in pilot projects on a small scale. Are we going to start importing ethanol in 2010 even though it can probably be produced more efficiently here than anywhere else in Europe? There are existing ethanol industries in Spain and Italy that are growing and expanding, especially as a result of the demise of the sugar industry in Ireland. The Government has an opportunity to try to redeem itself by finding [1981]alternatives for arable farmers, whether they grow wheat or sugar beet to produce ethanol, after an appalling and misleading performance in the last months of the sugar industry. We should use our influence as a shareholder in Greencore, albeit a small one, to ensure that everything possible is done to try to facilitate the transition from a sugar factory in Mallow to an ethanol or energy crop processing plant. The same opportunities apply to biodiesel through growing oil seed rape as apply to ethanol through growing sugar beet and wheat. We can make this happen by way of a combination of price supports from the European Union and tax incentives from the Irish Government. If we do not do so, it will be a huge opportunity missed for Irish agriculture and the Irish energy sector. Wood biomass is another important area. I regret that the Minister of State has left the House because he knows a bit about this area as a result of his work in the forestry sector. Whether it is fast growing wood coppice plantations, forestry thinnings or wood and paper waste, these are viable fuel sources that are being used to significant effect in other European countries. However, they are not being used in Ireland to the extent they could be. New peat power stations were built here in recent years which are ideal to allow a gradual substitution from peat to wood biomass over a period. We should use this source for environmental as well as cost-effective reasons from an energy fuel point of view. Tidal power, wave power and solar energy are all under-estimated by the Government. There is no reason a percentage of public housing projects cannot be powered through solar panels on the roofs. We should examine template projects in other European countries. It is not true to say that because we do not have very high sunshine rates, solar panels will not work. It will take political courage to deal with the ESB, which I do not see happening before the next general election. It is not the ESB’s fault that it is as dominant in the energy market. It is because it is good at its job that it retains this dominant position, and it is because of this dominant position that other players throughout Europe do not consider Ireland an attractive option to produce and supply power. This must change. Options should be considered to weaken the ESB’s dominance in the marketplace. We must consider whether this would mean separating the generation, supply and grid management in a real way or breaking up the ESB. My preference would be not to break up ESB generation.

1479980,606,9,137,Committee on Finance. - Financial Resolution No. 8: General (Resumed).,26/05/1971,Mr. Gerald L'Estrange,Fine Gael,Longford -Westmeath,"Let us all admit that another reason why we are not on the road to prosperity is that too many working hours are turned into hours for drinking, gambling and so on. Money is regarded by too many people of all classes as something to be got or won rather than earned. There are far too many trade unions in which the leaders are not in control of their members. While France, Germany, Italy and Japan—all countries that were beaten in the last war—have had their economic miracles, Ireland has not yet shown the willingness or the capacity to achieve her own miracle. This is due again to the squandermania of the Government, the fact that they themselves are not prepared to work, the fact that half of the members of the Government are not fit to be members of the Government. There are also too many managements who are unimaginative and have not treated their factory workers as they should have treated them, who are more interested in playing golf and having a good time than being on the factory floor, mixing with the workers and getting to know them, and giving proper leadership. Another reason for our failure is that the change from privilege to talent has been too slow in all too many of our board rooms. Too few of our factories have moved fast enough with the times and availed themselves of the adaptation grants, loans, et cetera that would prepare them for the competitive period that lies ahead. Again, the Government are to blame here. The workers should have a share in the running of the factory. If they give their lives, their sweat and their blood, they are entitled to some say. The Government through the State and semi-State bodies should give a lead. I do not see why we cannot have a workers' democracy. A beginning could and should be made. We are also failing economically because our own people are not prepared to buy Irish and support Irish industry. The more affluent they become [290] the more they are inclined to follow slavishly the trends and fashions of other countries and to purchase imported products. If the Government want to put us on the road to prosperity, to protect our industries and our workers, they must institute a Buy Irish campaign immediately. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said here some time ago that he is prepared to co-operate with every party. All parties should pool their resources and their energy in order to bring home to the people that it is in their own interests and that of their families to buy Irish. If we do not get the people interested in it now before we enter the EEC, then God help us when we do. In the last analysis economics is a matter of human nature and not of formulae. No country can be saved if the people will not save themselves. Unfortunately we are not getting the proper lead from the top. For the past few years leadership has been lacking, soft words have been substituted for hard facts. Exhortation has never been followed up by the present Government by deed and rights have come before responsibilities. The philosophy of far too many people in this country has been: 'All take and no give.' The Government have got us into the mess we are in. The blame must rest fairly and squarely on their shoulders. We have had low standards in high places for too long. The present Government have helped to drag our nation and our people into the gutter. The standing-idly-by policy of the Government is helping the drift to anarchy and the erosion of the old spirit of idealism and self-sacrifice, of neighbourliness and concern for others. Today, due to the 'get rich quick' mentality of members of the present Government and the fact that good positions in this country are filled by supporters of the Government irrespective of their ability, the fact that a person, as a Minister said one time, born without a seat in his trousers can become a millionaire if he has the right contacts, the fact that members of Taca get contracts to which they are not entitled, life in Ireland is a rat race in which racketeers, speculators [291] and Tacateers get richer and richer while the workers and the poor get poorer and poorer. Due to the lead given by the Government who should be interested in the financial future of the country especially in view of our EEC negotiations today it is mostly a case of each man for himself with no other motive to inspire the many than self-advancement, fast money and a Mercedes car. The people of Ireland expect better. The men of 1916, with ideas and ideals, did not risk their all for an Ireland that would be unworthy of their sacrifice. They stood by Ireland and did not run away from her when she was poor. They served the nation without asking for anything in return. They were prepared indeed at that time to sacrifice their lives for the welfare of the people. Contrast that with the 'get rich quick' merchants, some of whom are Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Party but many of whom are followers of that party, interested not in the future prosperity of the people, not in the economic position of the majority of the people, but interested in self-aggrandisement, in bringing wealth, privilege and prosperity to themselves and to their friends. Ireland today needs men in Government and in all sectors of our economy who are prepared not to sacrifice their lives but, by their work and example, to lead our people out of the morass in which they have been allowed to founder by the present Government. I claim that if we continue to barter, as we are bartering, with the things that make us a nation for material gain or personal aggrandisement the nation will assuredly die. The Ireland envisaged by our patriots is dying quickly. Despite the huge amount of money being demanded from our people in this Budget we are facing a crisis. The time has come to say to this arrogant and corrupt Government: 'Thus far shalt thou go and no further.' Ireland today needs honest men, needs an honest Government. It needs men of integrity to lead us into the more competitive period of the Common Market. An alternative is available on this side of the House [292] where there are honest men, men of ability, who are prepared to lead this country in the interests of the people. Because of the uncertainty and the instability that exist the time has come for the Taoiseach to face the people and ask for their verdict. In the last few years our troubles have been allowed to multiply. We are today spending £830 million of the people's money. Despite that we have fewer people in employment. We have 70,000 unemployed 500,000 emigrated in the last 14 years there are 158,000 fewer people at work than there were in 1951. All the signs point in the wrong direction. This is due to the fact that we have not got proper leadership. To paraphrase the words of Lord Melbourne, a British Prime Minister, it can be said of the present Taoiseach that as far as he was concerned, when he was faced with a problem, it was: 'Ponder, pause, prepare, postpone and end by leaving things alone. In fact earn the people's pay by standing idly every day.' The present Taoiseach and the present Government have done that for far too long. The country is paying dearly for it today.",26/05/1971,19,875,876,the welfare of the people Contrast that with the get rich quick merchants some of whom are Ministers in the,Fianna Fáil,Party but many of whom are followers of that party interested not in the future prosperity of the people not,Fianna Fáil,1479980_1,,the welfare of the people Contrast that with the get rich quick merchants some of whom are Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Party but many of whom are followers of that party interested not in the future prosperity of the people not,the welfare of the people Contrast that with the get rich quick merchants some of whom are Ministers in the Party but many of whom are followers of that party interested not in the future prosperity of the people not,text442,1,2,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.510825624,0.012770641,-0.158113883,-0.003952847,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.592592593,0.153153153,0.18018018,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1312195,1020,9,93,"Private Members Business. - Planning Appeals Bill, 1967—Second Stage (Resumed).",06/02/1968,Mr. Richie Ryan,Fine Gael,Dublin South-West,"I am not actually quoting but the reference to the speech of the Minister for Health is at columns 109-112, volume 232, 31st January, 1968. It is important that we should not lose sight of the matters which the Minister may now decide in secret and without giving reasons for his decisions. The Minister may make decisions on appeals related to permission to develop property or to retain a structure in respect of which planning permission was not obtained in relation to unauthorised use of property or he may make decisions on appeals against decisions by a planning authority taking the form of notices served by an authority on a property owner. He may make decisions in relation to preservation of amenities such as trees and other natural growths, or the creation of amenities such as rights of way. The Minister may make decisions on [489] appeals relating to decisions as to the payment of compensation by a planning authority and he may listen to appeals and decide them concerning the relaxation of building regulations and a host of other matters. One particularly obnoxious provision of the present measure is that people who object to the decision of the local authority or to the prosecution of an appeal if they are not the party involved may not be heard and it seems quite ludicrous that in planning matters where the consequences may be very much greater than the giving of a publichouse licence, people in the adjoining area may not be heard. I think all Members of the House and the public in general are well aware that when a person seeks to convert a non-licensed premises into a licensed one or seeks to transfer the licence to another property, all objectors may be heard and, in fact, must be heard, and no matter how thin the objection or how apparently shallow it may appear to be to some people, the courts must hear the objectors before a decision is taken. The objectors have the right to cross-examine the people who are making the application for the transfer of licence and the people who are objecting may, of course, also be cross-examined by those who are seeking to have a licensed premises set up. I think it is true that the number of people who could possibly be affected by any publichouse is in many cases much less than the number affected by many of the decisions which have already been taken by the Minister for Local Government under the Planning Act not to speak of the decisions which he may yet be called upon to make. To say that it is quite right and proper that objectors should be heard to applications for licensed premises and at the same time that objectors may not be heard to applications to demolish large numbers of houses and to say that objectors may not be heard to applications to building plans and to say that objectors will not be heard to applications to establish noissome industries is to be at least lacking in consistency. I think we can go further and say it is positively dishonest to provide that objectors may not be [490] heard in relation to planning matters. That is why we are providing in section 7 of this Bill that such objectors may be heard. The Volume of work which the Minister has been called upon to do has been so great that he personally could not have handled all those decisions. We know, that he is responsible for all decisions taken in his name. It may be that he has indicated a certain pattern to be followed by the people who are processing the planning appeals. I think there are indications that in some cases common principles are applied, but where you have a system which operates in secret you are bound to have departures from the lines of policy which are set. When you have reason to believe that those departures are made in return for political favours we have every reason to be very concerned about the present system. I think Deputy Fitzpatrick has already given figures of the volume of appeals that have been submitted to the Minister but if the House will bear with me for the sake of tidying up the loose ends of my comments I shall repeat them. In the year ended 30th September, 1965 there were 979 appeals in the year ending 30th September, 1966 1,125 in the year ending 30th September, 1967, 1,322. It is rather alarming to discover that only a small proportion of those appeals have yet been determined. We find that in the first year when 979 appeals were submitted only 437 were decided by the Minister. If you take the second year and add to the number of appeals in that year—which is 1,125—the other 540 appeals which were left undecided at the end of the year, you see that only 862 decisions were made by the Minister and that there is still a colossal backlog of undecided appeals. The situation is worse in the year ending 30th September last when 1,322 were submitted and only 999 were decided, remembering that you had a backlog of well over 1,000 from the previous two years. This indicates that the machinery which is provided under the 1963 Act is utterly inadequate. If any person seeking justice for a £5 debt, or a £50 debt, or a £500 debt, [491] had to wait that length of time for a decision there would be a public outcry and the Minister for Justice would be under strong pressure to increase the number of judges so as to ensure that the delays in the processing of people's affairs would be wiped out in the future. Quite clearly, then, the present system is crumbling it is not capable of being efficiently operated, and certainly the individual who is empowered by this Dáil, and by the Seanad, to make the decisions is not making them because he is incapable of handling all that work himself and his underlings are also incapable of handling the volume of work they have had submitted, notwithstanding the fact that, as we said earlier, many people who quite properly should be heard in relation to these appeals are being silenced and are not being given the opportunity of being heard. That is why we return to the fundamental principle which we think must be recognised, that justice must not only be done but it must seem to be done and must be seen to be done. These things are not happening at present. The decisions which a Minister can make under our planning laws can add greatly to the value of property or they can detract enormously from the value of property. It is a well-known principle of law that if the value of a person's property is threatened by the conduct or omissions of another person, that the person whose property is threatened may apply to the court for an injunction so as to obtain an immediate remedy and to ensure that pending a decision on the matter in dispute, the value of the property may be maintained. We have no such safeguard under our planning legislation and it was never envisaged, certainly and it was never envisaged by the Government because they rebutted any suggestion we made on these lines, that people should be uncertain as to the value of their property. It was never thought that people would be so restricted or so uneasy, as they are at present, by reason of the many handicaps under which the present system is obliged to operate. It is because of an anxiety to ensure [492] that these tribulations would be brought to an end that we wish to see established a proper appeals tribunal, or tribunals, we do not care how many different tribunals have to be established if the demand is there, then we should answer the demand by providing the proper system of adjudication on appeals and not leave the present situation which is allowing a greater and greater backlog to build up every year. I am conscious of a case which I have brought on a number of occasions to the notice of the Minister's Department in which an application was made to a county council for permission to build by a person who had signed a contract for the purchase of a piece of land subject to getting planning permission. Planning permission was refused by the local authority and the would-be purchaser of the land made an appeal to the Minister for Local Government against the refusal of the local authority. Simultaneously, the vendor of the property made an appeal to the Minister for Local Government. Some time later the vendor of the property apparently had second thoughts about this matter and notified the Minister, of whom he is a personal friend, that he did not wish to proceed with his appeal and it was not until more than a year after when the would-be purchaser made an inquiry, that the purchaser found out that the Minister for Local Government had marked the appeal as 'withdrawn'. The result was that this person who wanted to buy the land to build a house for himself, his wife and family, was left in suspense for over a year because of some arrangement which suited the vendor of the property. Although the better part of two years. has passed since the would-be purchaser of the property made an appeal no decisions has yet been taken. I will acknowledge that when it was pointed out to the Minister that the withdrawal by the vendor of his application had no bearing upon the application by the purchaser, the purchaser was informed that the matter was being reopened and that a decision would be given in due course. However, that was many, many months ago and at present the [493] would-be purchaser, who put down a deposit as an earnest on the contract, is unable to get from the vendor, who clearly engaged in some sharp practice, a return of his deposit, and is unable, on that account, to acquire other plots of land because his assets are tied up in the original application. Here we have the position that a man, with his wife and family, is obliged to rent accommodation at a rack rent for a very lengthy period all because of the incompetence of the Department of Local Government, or perhaps, incompetence is too severe a word, he is unable because of the utter inability of the Department of Local Government to process his application. If it is not inability through pressure of work it is downright corruption, so the Minister may choose between one or the other. Certainly there is no other explanation. Unfortunately, we have not got in this country an ombudsman, some impartial person who would have the right of protecting the individual against the almighty State, some person who would have the right of examining the conduct of the State and of rectifying this conduct where such was found necessary. I am glad to say that the Ard-Fheis of the Fine Gael Party has recommended the introduction of a system on a parallel with the ombudsman which operates in the Scandinavian countries and we hope the day is not too long distant when some such establishment will be provided here. Indeed, in a number of the countries in the European Community, with which it is thought by some people we may one day be joined, there are systems which allow the private citizen to have recourse to an independent authority to assess the fairness or correctness of Government action. We have not got such a system and in the absence of such a system the only alternative which can provide fair play for the individual and be seen to provide it is to set up some independent trubunal. In the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 we of the Fine Gael Party pressed all along for the establishment of an independent tribunal to hear appeals on ministerial and administrative action. We were glad [494] that the Minister for Labour accepted the Fine Gael amendment to establish an independent appeals tribunal. It may not be all we would wish it to be but it is something that can only be tried out in the light of experience and it gives, I think, a fair hope that the individual who feels aggrieved by an administrative decision will have his grievance heard and properly heard by people who will be in a position to assess the fairness or otherwise of the decision and to hear all sides. At present we have not got such a system in relation to planning matters and planning matters can be just as important for any one individual and every bit as important for the community as any matter affecting any worker under the Redundancy Payments scheme. On that account we think that it is vitally necessary that an independent tribunal should be established. The one which we suggest is I feel an extremely fair one. Indeed, I think the Minister for Health speaking from the Government benches gave an indication that he considered the tribunal which we had in mind to be a fair one. It could be argued I suppose that the personnel should be drawn from some other source. It could be suggested that it could be increased in size and various alterations might be put forward but basically the structure of the board which we would establish is a fair one and is the kind of thing which we would recommend the Government to establish. We would provide that the board be composed of a judge, of a person nominated by the Minister for Local Government and of another qualified person to be drawn from a panel set up by the Local Appointments Commission. The persons to be drawn from the panel would have to have relevant qualifications: those of civil engineering, architecture or qualified town planning. The case was made during the 1963 Act debate that the State had a very great responsibility, particularly where public money might be involved and particularly where the public interest was involved to vest in a Minister of State who would be answerable to this Dáil, the power to make decisions in [495] planning matters. That is an argument which one would not lightly dismiss but we feel that it is fair to say that the public interest would be provided for by allowing the Minister for Local Government to nominate a qualified person in whom he had confidence to the board of experts which we would set up independent of direct ministerial influence. To suggest that the interest of the State, that the interest of the community, that the common welfare would not be protected if a board were to be chaired by a judge is to suggest that our judiciary is incompetent or is not concerned with the public interest. I know of no action in the whole history of our judiciary which would give the least justification to such an allegation and, therefore, with a member of the judiciary and a nominee of the Minister's on a board it is certain that the public interest would be safeguarded. We in Fine Gael believe that it would be safeguarded to a much greater extent than under the existing system in which the public interest, in which the community welfare becomes subordinated to political partisan advantage to the party of the Minister of the day. It is on that account that we commend to the Dáil for serious consideration the Bill which we are putting before the people. We are aware of and we are encouraged by the numerous responsible associations which have complained about the present system and which have called for an amendment. We are grateful for the support which has been given to the idea which we seek to enshrine in this legislation to have an independent board established. Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) referred to the unanimous call of the Association of Municipal Authorities for the transfer of planning appeals from the Minister to an appeals board. We should also remember that the Architects Institute and the Engineers Institute have expressed similar views and at least a number of chambers of commerce, including the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, have expressed their anxiety about what is occurring under the present legislation and have called [496] for, as we are now calling for, the setting up of an independent tribunal which will command the respect of everybody in the community and which will ensure that planning—town planning, property planning, is as it ought to be, something conducted only with concern for the betterment of the community, meeting that concern with an equal anxiety that no individual would be unfairly treated and that no individual would receive exceptionally favourable treatment simply because of his actual or pretended allegiance to the party of the person making the decision. These are the principles which underlie the Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill and, as I said earlier, we defy the Government to refuse to accept the Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill. If they refuse to accept it they will only help to crystallise the tremendous suspicion that exists, something more than a suspicion, that they wish to retain the present system because of the monetary benefit which flows to the political party which, for the time being, is in Government.",06/02/1968,18,2875,2876,the Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill and as I said earlier we defy the Government to refuse to accept the,Fine Gael,Planning Appeals Bill If they refuse to accept it they will only help to crystallise the tremendous suspicion that exists,Fine Gael,1312195_6,,the Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill and as I said earlier we defy the Government to refuse to accept the Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill If they refuse to accept it they will only help to crystallise the tremendous suspicion that exists,the Fine Gael Planning Appeals Bill and as I said earlier we defy the Government to refuse to accept the Planning Appeals Bill If they refuse to accept it they will only help to crystallise the tremendous suspicion that exists,text758,4,4,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.079056942,-0.001976424,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.231231231,0.243243243,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2650630,604,8,90,European Community Affairs: Statements.,02/04/1993,Mr. Tom Kitt,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South,"I thank Deputies for their contributions today and Deputy Durkan, in particular, with whom I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities when I first came to this House. I am conscious of the contribution he made to that Committee. With regard to both his opening and closing remarks regarding the calling of quorums I should say I find this an infantile mode of behaviour, especially if we accept reality as politicians. It is a Friday. Today I made arrangements that two other Ministers of State would sit in for me and take note of the contributions while I met with a visiting delegation of Tanzanians. As it happened I had to leave that meeting and come back because Deputy Dukes was in bad humour today and wanted to play some games. There are other ways of making useful contributions. We are not afraid of the Deputy's criticisms. With regard to Deputy Durkan's constituency colleague, Deputy Dukes, I understand he had some harsh things to say about me in my absence. I will reply briefly. I have had a close interest in European developments and foreign policy in general since my involvement in the Dáil. He was very critical of the fact that in my 20-minute contribution I informed the Dáil about my visits, among other things, to El Salvador and to the Horn of Africa. I make no apology for doing so. In the past as a backbench Deputy, I have been critical that Members of the Dáil were not fully informed of what was going on. Deputy Dukes criticised the Government in general [370] for not telling him what we are doing. I suggest there is a degree of inconsistency in his contribution. I do not think Deputy Dukes listened to his own leader yesterday who asked for a broader debate in which he referred to the former Yugoslavia. I was in the House when that request was made and I strongly supported the broadening of the debate. In my 20-minute contribution I made reference to my recent visit to Africa and also to an EC Central American meeting. I thought that was appropriate and that it was my duty to do so. I make no apology whatsoever for doing that. Even though Deputy Dukes is not present I want to put that on the record.",02/04/1993,27,9,10,I thank Deputies for their contributions today and,Deputy Durkan,in particular with whom I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities,Deputy Durkan,2650630_1,,I thank Deputies for their contributions today and Deputy Durkan in particular with whom I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities,I thank Deputies for their contributions today and in particular with whom I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities,text230,0,2,0,0,28,0.071428571,2,1.609437912,0.057479925,0.094491118,0.003374683,0.871871872,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.944944945,0.578578579,0.621621622,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

899801,59,8,48,Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate—Donegal Water Supply Schemes.,10/05/1955,Mr. Neil T. Blaney,Fianna Fáil,Donegal East,"On Wednesday of last week I had three questions down for reply by the Minister for Local Government: the first one asked the Minister if he will make available a grant from the National Development Fund towards the cost of providing a public water supply for the Fanad peninsula, County Donegal the second one asked if the Minister will make available a grant towards the cost of providing a regional water supply for the Fanad Gaeltacht, County Donegal and the third asked the Minister what is the present position in regard to the Rossnakill - Tamney water supply scheme. The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davin, deputising for the Minister, made the following reply:— 'With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, it is proposed to take [1192] Questions Nos. 45, 46 and 47 together. Proposals for a water supply scheme for Rossnakill and Tamney were submitted by Donegal County Council in 1940 and resubmitted in 1947 but, because of the inadequacy of the source, were not approved. Subsequently a number of other possible sources were investigated and the county engineer's report was considered by the county council last December. A copy of this report was not received in the Department until yesterday, but an inquiry was received from the county council on the 20th January as to the amount of State assistance which would be made available for a regional scheme for North Fanad. Such a scheme would also serve Rossnakill. The maximum rate of subsidy by way of contribution to loan charges in respect of Gaeltacht water supply schemes is 43? per cent., but consideration is at present being given to the representations made by the county council that Gaeltacht water supply schemes should be subsidised at a higher rate, whether from the National Development Fund or otherwise.' I then asked the following supplementary question:— 'Am I to take it that, until the Local Government Department, arising from these questions, got in touch with the local authority in Donegal, no report whatever was received from these people in regard to this matter, although decisions were arrived at last December by the Donegal County Council?' To that supplementary question, Deputy Davin made the following reply:— 'When the Deputy reads carefully he will see that the Department could do nothing more at the moment.' I then asked further supplementary questions and I should like to say now first of all, without accusing the Minister of anything, that the question of a water supply for the Rossnakill-Tamney area was brought to the notice of the Department somewhere around 1940, but due to difficulties, [1193] technical and otherwise, and due to the situation created by the war and, at a later stage, to scarcity of supplies, nothing could be done. In 1947 the scheme was again brought to the notice of the Department but the source at first available had been found during the intervening years to be not quite suitable or adequate for the needs of this particular district. In addition to that, I should like to say that in 1948 a five-year programme of work was brought into being by the local authority. In Donegal during the war, when most of the work could not be done, the staff were confined to post-war planning. The Rossnakill water supply scheme was within that five-year programme but was very well down the list of priority. The result is that during the past year we have just reached this scheme on the 1948 list. It was proposed in June and July of last year that a full investigation should immediately be carried out and that all available information should be put before the county council at the earliest possible date with a view to going ahead with the scheme as originally intended. It was found after some considerable time that the trouble that had first made itself felt in 1947—the inadequacy of the supply from the original source—had again to be faced. As a result of further exploration by our water engineer, we found what he described to me last August as the ideal source, not only from the point of view of quantity but also of quality and from the point of view of gravity as far as any part of the parish was concerned. Immediately I heard of this I felt that here was a peninsula which had no public water supply other than spring wells and pumps, some of which had been erected by the county council. Having asked the engineer to bring before the council at the earliest possible moment his report on this new source and on all other sources available at the county council meeting in December. 1954, I proposed two resolutions which were carried to the effect that, in view of the fact that this new source at a place known as Tullyconnell Lake, and quite a bit removed [1194] from the Rossnakill area and in the heart of the Fanad Peninsula, could supply a sufficiency of water not only for the one area but for the whole parish, something more than the mere supply of water to the Rossnakill-Tamney area should be undertaken. Also, in view of the fact that from our engineer's reports we were able to gather that the cost per house, no matter from what source the supply was taken, was going to be rather high, comparatively speaking, I felt we might, with benefit to the council from the financial viewpoint, make up part of the capital outlay by developing the source in Tullyconnell Lake. On a resolution passed unanimously it was decided to ask the Department which was handling the National Development Fund for a grant from the fund for a supply that would serve the peninsula. It was also decided by the council that as part of the peninsula is in the Fior-Ghaeltacht we should seek from whatever Minister was responsible a grant for a Gaeltacht scheme for part of the parish. All this would have meant that the Rossnakill-Tamney scheme originally contemplated woud eventually evolve as part of a much greater scheme. In such an eventuality the local authority would not be saddled with the capital development of a very large lake. It was also noted that the cost per house for the water would be much lower. These areas have been on our list and must be given water supplies if we are to keep faith with our people and to show any consistency in our planning. That proposal, as far as I know, took the form of a letter of inquiry to one of the Departments. That letter was sent on the 19th January last and, as far as I can find out, in spite of the fact that the inquiry was a bona fide inquiry asked by council officials on behalf of the local authority, no reply was received, according to the officials, until the 5th of this month. It is on that point that I must show my disapproval and that I must question the accuracy of the reply I was given by the Parliamentary Secretary. One would be led to believe, from the original reply to my questions given by Deputy Davin here, that [1195] nothing whatever had been done about this business except that in 1940 somebody, from somewhere out of the blue, threw it into the Department and said: 'We want a water scheme for this district,' and then as suddenly as the proposal was made just as suddenly and completely did it disappear until, in 1947, it re-emerged and was again thrown into the Department only to find that due to technical difficulties it could not be done, and that from 1947 until last week, when I had these questions down, the Donegal County Council or no other council and no other person had, in fact, made any effort whatever to do anything about it. It was for that reason, that I knew that that was not so and that possibly Deputy Davin was not in a position to know whether it was so or not, not being a member of the Donegal County Council, that I asked some supplementary questions in an endeavour to have the matter cleared up. I asked him if it were a fact that until I had put down the questions and his Department had communicated with the Donegal County Council nothing was done about this scheme since 1940. It was because of that and for no other reason that I put those supplementary questions to Deputy Davin. Apparently, as he said himself, he suspected I wanted to take this on the Adjournment.",10/05/1955,15,1326,1327,do anything about it It was for that reason that I knew that that was not so and that possibly,Deputy Davin,was not in a position to know whether it was so or not not being a member of the Donegal,Deputy Davin,899801_4,,do anything about it It was for that reason that I knew that that was not so and that possibly Deputy Davin was not in a position to know whether it was so or not not being a member of the Donegal,do anything about it It was for that reason that I knew that that was not so and that possibly was not in a position to know whether it was so or not not being a member of the Donegal,text225,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.09486833,0.002371708,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.57957958,0.555555556,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2467180,515,9,142,Questions Nominated for Priority: Motion.,27/03/1990,Mr. Jim Higgins,Fine Gael,Mayo East,"The arrangement being put in place by this motion has been thrashed out both publicly and in the House before. Thankfully the Opposition parties have some small scope within the rules and strictures of the House for personal or private initiatives. Private Members' time is the main vehicle for this, albeit a mere three hours each week. We must, therefore, put in place some agreed arrangement for the allocation of this small but significant facility. As the Minister of State rightly said, it is primarily a matter for resolution among the Opposition parties. I want to emphasise that when this matter came before the House last November every possible option was looked at. The only matter that could not be resolved was who got what amount of time. At the end of the day we had to have recourse to the numerical strength of the parties. Fine Gael have 55 seats, the Labour Party have 15 seats and The Workers' Party have 7 seats. Fine Gael therefore have two and a half times the combined numerical strength of the other two parties — 55 as against 22. The Labour Party have more than double the number of seats held by The Workers' Party. Working on the basis of 77 combined Opposition seats, Fine Gael are entitled to five out of every seven Private Members' debates, and Labour are entitled to twice The Workers' Party's entitlement. While The Workers' Party [1240] may, as the Minister of State said, protest, that they should be entitled to more, I have not heard one valid, cogent argument to justify that. Of course, every party would like to have a bigger slice of the action, but at the end of the day it has to be decided by the numerical strength of the parties or proportional representation. On the issue of priority questions, Fine Gael sought vainly to accommodate all sides. There are five priority questions each day. Fine Gael with the other two parties tried to prevail on the Government to increase this to six by which one would have to concede three additional minutes of Government time to Question Time. The breakdown of that arrangement would mean that Fine Gael would be prepared to have three questions, the Labour Party two and The Workers' Party one. This, however, did not meet with the agreement of the Government and, finally, we had to revert to proportional representation or numerical strength of the parties. This was the deciding factor. The formula, therefore, is to give each party their precise entitlement and any deviation from this disadvantages some other party. When the numerical strength of The Workers' Party increases, then and only then will we be prepared to look at any rearrangement of the existing breakdown of both priority questions and Private Members' time.",27/03/1990,26,323,324,the issue of priority questions Fine Gael sought vainly to accommodate all sides There are five priority questions each day,Fine Gael,with the other two parties tried to prevail on the Government to increase this to six by which one would,Fine Gael,2467180_6,,the issue of priority questions Fine Gael sought vainly to accommodate all sides There are five priority questions each day Fine Gael with the other two parties tried to prevail on the Government to increase this to six by which one would,the issue of priority questions Fine Gael sought vainly to accommodate all sides There are five priority questions each day with the other two parties tried to prevail on the Government to increase this to six by which one would,text295,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.071151247,0.001778781,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.518518519,0.504504505,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1438385,234,9,77,Private Business. - Adjournment (Summer Recess): Motion.,28/07/1970,Mr. Liam Cosgrave,Fine Gael,Dublin County,"I think it is a commentary on the political situation that has presented itself and has existed in this country for some months that this is the first major review we have had of the state of the economy, and that it comes on the very eve of the Adjournment of the Dáil. The diagnosis which the Taoiseach made in connection with inflation and the effects of inflation on the economy, and its reaction on living standards, is not one with which anyone will disagree in general. What we will question and, indeed, question in respect of a number of aspects of the stated policy of the Government, is how the operation and influence of Government policy is effected in practice rather than in speeches. This applies not merely to the economic and social aspects of the country's affairs but in particular to the political matters which were the subject of the concluding remarks which the Taoiseach referred to as the third point related to the other two. Undoubtedly the rise in prices in this country in the past year has been extremely alarming. The published statistics in the Central Bank report refer to a rise of over 7 per cent in the consumer price index. Today at Question Time a statistical question was answered about the price rise and it would appear that the rise in 12 months has been over 8 per cent. Even the statisticians find it difficult to keep in touch and to keep up to date with the price rises. This year it appears, on present indications, that the price rise may be as much as 10 per cent. This is an unprecedented rise in this country and, indeed, it is difficult to see, if that trend continues, how this country can avoid a major economic crisis. The [2175] various informed bodies that have addressed themselves to this problem and the comments that have been made reinforce—and, indeed, one need not go beyond the two documents issued within the past week which clearly emphasise this—what this party have said for the best part of the past 12 months, that is, that the economy was in a dangerous situation and that the trends of developments were such that we had reached a stage where confidence in our economic position had been severely shaken. One aspect of this is, of course, the continued rise in wages and the effect that high increases in incomes have had on price levels, and the continued chasing of higher prices by higher wages with higher wages followed again by higher prices. The trouble is that the demand for high wage and salary increases is caused by rising prices and particularly by the fact that workers and others in employment, both wage and salary earners, feel that prices will rise even faster in the future. If a trade union or a body representing workers is negotiating on behalf of its members an agreement for a certain level of wages which it is anticipated will run for a period of 18 months or two years, it naturally wants to be sure that it gets at least enough to cushion its members against price rises during the term of that agreement. At the rate of price increases we have seen here, anybody now negotiating for an 18 month agreement would have to anticipate an increase of at least 15 per cent merely to ensure that his income in 18 months time was not less in actual real terms than it is now. In practice, of course, naturally people are looking for a great deal more because on the basis of the published figures and the prices that have been quoted and which are contained in different groups of statistics, they have less and less confidence that even the present rate of price increases will be held. They are also concerned to ensure that other groups within the community do not secure proportionately more than they do. Therefore, we [2176] have a more or less frantic scramble to secure income increases to counteract rising prices which, in turn, are being pushed up by rising incomes. This has been referred to at some considerable length in the recent report of the Central Bank, which was referred to by the Taoiseach, and in which it is stated that Ireland's rate of price inflation is above the international trend and carries serious implication for future sales of Irish goods and services and that competitiveness is being eroded by a degree of price and cost inflation which is greater even than in the United Kingdom and much greater than in the EEC countries generally. This report dwelt at some length on the problems that have arisen here and on the effect of price increases as well as the disturbed state of industrial relations. It referred to this as one of the most serious problems possible. One of the references in an article at the end of the book showed that in the earlier period between 1950 and 1959 Ireland ranked fifth in the countries mentioned in the magnitude of its consumer price rise but in the decade 1960-69 it had moved to joint second place. The result of that situation is that there is a tendency among many people —this appears to include the Government who adopt a fatalistic attitude to it—to take the view that one simply does nothing and that in the long run everything will work itself out satisfactorily. This, I believe in the circumstances, is an irresponsible view. It is obvious that, particularly in a small country, inflation cannot go beyond a certain point without having very severe consequences for a large number of people. The Government attitude, in effect, is to transfer the blame to the trade unions, to industry or to any other section and the Government follow a policy of masterly inaction on the basis that there is nothing they can do. This is precisely the policy and attitude that very largely has got us into the present situation. I have repeatedly said, and we have repeatedly expressed the view from this side of the House, that there is [2177] no instant formula to deal with these problems, no short cut that can be taken to cure or solve everything overnight. The solution to the kind of difficulties which we have is essentially to have a consistent long-term and clearly understood Government policy. This is what leadership is about and it is the only basis on which confidence can be rebuilt. It is unrealistic and foolish to expect that individuals and groups will hold back from pressing their own interests to the limit as long as they feel that the Government have not a policy which can secure justice in the economy without a free-for-all. The catalogue of mistakes and examples of ineptitude on the part of the Government in handling the economy is a long one. The Government have shown no consistent policy in respect of the economy that can clearly be understood and accepted by all sections of the community. They have skipped from one short-term expedient to another, shamelessly manipulating the economy for short-term political purposes. About 18 months ago the then Minister for Finance went on radio and television and delivered an address expressing the view that the country faced an economic crisis. Within a month, that crisis had evaporated and a Budget which granted remissions and reductions was introduced solely for the purpose of securing electoral advantage. At that time the Central Bank, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Report of the National Industrial Economic Council expressed concern and advocated action in respect of certain spheres of the economy and also advocated corrective action. The result of the about-turn in Government policy was that people naturally pressed their claims and pursued their individual demands, either collectively under trade union auspices, or in whatever way it served them to negotiate wage and salary adjustments to get whatever share they could of the national cake. At the end of the year in which things had been let rip, prices had increased. When the problem had reached very serious dimensions and midway through the negotiation of the [2178] 12th round of wages the Government announced that there should be a 7 per cent limit to income increases in 1970. They announced at the same time a corresponding threat of control on prices to the extent of about 4 per cent. That was about as effective as trying to stop a train with a piece of string. The situation that has developed since is such that it has been the subject of most severe criticism and comment, not by politicians or by the Opposition, although we have expressed concern at the situation, but, as I said recently, by two specific bodies in either of which you would need a magnifying glass to find a Fine Gael spokesman, the Central Bank and Córas Tráchtála. Both have expressed their concern and supported it by statistics which show that last year, in a table of Manufacturing Industry Percentage Changes in Unit Wage Costs in the Major Industrial Countries and in Ireland, the rise here was substantially greater and was more than double the highest figure for any other country. The increase in Italy was 5. 3 whereas here it was 10. 9. It went on to comment on the fact that Government spending and consumption were all rapidly expanding and that the policy pursued in respect of this had been deliberately inflationary. It said that the choice of financing methods used to provide money for the Exchequer's capital requirements and for any deficit in the current budget had a major influence on the behaviour of aggregate demand which, in turn, affects prices and the external balance. In general, it said, the greater the extent to which an increase in Government expenditure is financed by taxation or by domestic saving rather than by money creation or external borrowing, the less marked will be the effect of such increased expenditure on aggregate demand. Last week, or the week before, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, I got a list of the items that had increased in price between mid-May, 1969, and mid-May of this year. These price increases had occurred in respect of every item included in the consumer price index. It showed that in respect of meat [2179] of every category, fish, vegetables, flour, milk, in respect of all articles of food, in respect of clothing, drink, tobacco, fuel and light and in respect of housing, hospital charges, every item that affects the domestic consumer either as an individual or as a person responsible for meeting family commitments, there has been a very substantial increase. Since then the turnover tax has been doubled from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent. That is one of the greatest contributors to an inflationary situation, one of the factors that have added further to the problems which have been referred to by the Central Bank and the problems that have been referred to in the report of Córas Tráchtála. Córas Tráchtála adverted to this in the report which was published in the last day or two in which, having referred to a table at the bottom of page 8, showing that the export performance in this country was the lowest in the percentage volume increase last year of any of the EEC countries or of Britain, it went on to say: The figures quoted in the table above for export price increases show that our prices increased by almost two and a half times EEC prices and twice British export prices. It then referred to the NIEC report on incomes and prices which said that in 1969, and I quote: Prices and money incomes have risen faster in Ireland than in any other OECD country. Then it went on: This, coupled with industrial unrest and loss of working hours through disputes and stoppages, imposed severe disabilities on Irish exporters compared with their overseas competitors. This body which, I am glad to see, can show a record of expansion and development in exports was established as a result of a committee appointed by my colleague, Mr. Dan Morrissey, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce. It has shown quite remarkable success in respect of industrial and other exports, to such an extent that [2180] this organisation commissioned a study by Arthur D. Little, Incorporated, of the Methods and Techniques of Export Promotion employed in Ireland and a number of other western European countries. This report concluded, inter alia, that the tax benefits and other services provided to the Irish exporters collectively amount to as generous export promotion incentives as are available in any country and that Ireland's future export promotion activity can be carried out effectively by existing institutions among which Córas Tráchtála could continue to play a key role. Our ability to compete with our principal competitors, either Britain or other EEC countries, has been very severely taxed and jeopardised as is mentioned in this particular commentary and in the Central Bank Report. It is, therefore, difficult to understand the recent Budget policy and hard to accept it as a sound economic instrument. The Central Bank commentary, the commentary of the NIEC as well as that of the other bodies that have dealt with the economic situation have referred, as the Taoiseach remarked, to the effects of inflation. The increase in turnover tax, the additional burden it has placed on consumers, the additional burdens on the cost of a variety of commodities have been referred to here on many occasions. There has recently been some reference to the effect of price changes and their influence on the tourist trade. One of the factors that have been referred to is the difference in prices of commodities in this country and in Britain. From recent figures of ordinary items, I find the price of a pint of Guinness in London in a number of cases is 3s here it is 3s 6d. The price of a gallon of petrol, best grade, here is 6s 8d in England it is 6s 6d. In addition to that, the cost of the car ferry service to the Continent is substantially lower than the cost of the ferry service to this country. While it is true that the problem, to which I shall refer later, in the North of Ireland had an effect on the number of tourists who have come here and caused a number of cancellations in bookings and generally disorganised [2181] the normal expansion which one would expect in the number of tourists, tourism has also been affected by other factors, some of them directly attributable to Government policy. The only merit one can see in the introduction of the turnover tax, and the increase in it in the manner in which it was done, is the intention to get in at one sweep as much of a slice of revenue as possible and hit as many people in as many ways as possible in respect of the items that are included in it. We must consider, however, the effect on the economy of such price increases. There is the burden imposed, as referred to by the Taoiseach, on the weaker sections. We have seen very substantial wage and salary demands over recent months in respect of workers, and one can understand the effect of price rises on the weaker sections of the community. It is true that the increases which were granted in nominal terms in the Budget in respect of social welfare categories appeared greater than those given before, but compared with the rise in prices, compared with the wage and salary demands made by trade unions and other organised sections on behalf of their workers, it is obvious that the increases that have been granted are not sufficient to enable people to maintain their existing standard of living, not to speak of improving it. The view we have put forward is one we have expressed repeatedly, that a national prices and incomes policy should have been adopted, and it is not yet too late to do it. Undoubtedly, a policy of this sort is not one that can be forced upon the community. It is not economically or statistically or in regard to particular categories of workers perfect in every respect, but it is a move in the right direction and it can make an effective and a purposeful contribution to the orderly adjustment of wages and salaries. This particular matter has been referred to in other reports and recommendations. The Central Bank report underlines its conviction that not only is action by the Government urgently necessary but that it is feasible and even at this stage could be of value. One of its most significant quotations is from the [2182] Report of the Bank of International Settlements in which, referring to developments in many countries and particularly the effect of inflationary problems in other countries, it says: One is that delays in tackling inflation are not only costly but serve to make later corrections more difficult. At a later stage in this report where the question of price inflation was considered in an article written by Mr. Hoare it said: In advanced economies generally rising prices are evils to be eradicated. Rising prices sap the moral fibre of the community by endowing some individuals with unmerited gains and by reducing the standard of living of the lower and constant income classes, unless compensated for by a policy of income redistribution entailing high rates of taxation. Rising prices threaten internal peace because they promote labour trouble, and external peace because of the danger of the deterioration in the terms of trade between economically advanced and less advanced countries. That reinforces the picture that has been given but it is made all the more urgent by the deterioration in the competitive capacity of this country compared with the countries to whom we are selling. One of the facts referred to by the Central Bank is that our true economic growth rate is slowing up while at the same time prices are accelerating. It said that the number of workers taken into industrial enterprises increased rapidly in 1969. It showed that in that year there was an increase in the number of workers taken into certain industries of about 11,000 or 12,000 but that that was matched by an outflow in respect of agriculture of approximately the same amount and that the net overall increase as a result of the changes was only about 4,000. This situation had implications because of the wage cost structure which as I said earlier increased more than twice as fast here as in Britain during the same period, nearly three times as fast as in Germany and four times as [2183] fast as in the United States, Japan and France. These figures and the references made by the Taoiseach as well as the figures I quoted from An Córas Tráchtála emphasise one thing: that these are not remote figures. They are not without particular practical significance. They are figures which pose a potential threat to the immediate employment of every worker and they mean that what we offer for export is less competitively priced than it was before. That is a serious problem when we consider that 40,000 people in Ireland depend directly, and many thousands depend indirectly, on exports for their jobs. It would be foolish to imagine that because we have not got mass unemployment yet, we have nothing to fear. Export orders are booked long in advance. It is only now that export salesmen are finding that because their costs have gone up so much faster than the countries to which I have referred, and the countries to which they are endeavouring to sell, what they have to offer is not as attractive as it was last year or the year before. This does not apply to exports alone countries to which we have been selling, Britain and the EEC countries, also sell goods on the Irish market. Because our costs are rising faster than theirs, their products are becoming more competitive and therefore our imports of those goods are increasing. That is why I believe, as the Central Bank report points out, our rate of industrial growth is slowing up. It means that fewer new jobs are being created and the danger of increased emigration is likely to occur again. One of the factors to which the Central Bank report referred was the continuance of the very high rate of Government expenditure and borrowing. In one of the earliest references in the report it shows that public expenditure, current and capital combined, rose by over 18 per cent, in both 1968-69 and 1969-70, which was more than the increase in respect of private expenditure, current and capital, which rose by approximately 14 per cent in the same period. It adverted to the fact that, as has been referred to many [2184] times, external borrowing as a method of financing public expenditure is the most costly and most highly inflationary it is possible to adopt. It is of course true, and this should be clearly understood, that much of the expenditure is for purposes about the desirability of which there is general agreement—health, housing, land reclamation, programmes of that character and of capital and social developments and improvements, on which there is no disagreement. There is, however, strong evidence that much of the public spending is less than it could be and represents an ineffective use of national resources. Indeed, the Devlin report underlines the fact that the present Government machine is not capable of running a modern economy efficiently. Time and again the lack of effective training throughout the public service is stressed and it is indicated that without proper effective training and without the Government machine being modernised and streamlined the best possible use of resources cannot be made to the fullest desirable extent. When, as is the case of this country, the resources are limited the greatest care is needed when deciding on priorities for their expenditure, and proper co-ordination with various branches of Government to ensure that what they do and what they spend fits properly into an overall Government plan. This is the whole purpose of national planning. Yet at the very time when this is most urgently needed the Government have virtually abandoned the whole policy of planning and have reverted to the former system of ad hoc decisions guided by short-term political expediency. There is little evidence that the Government recognise how important it is to examine the Devlin report recommendations and how urgently necessary it is to implement them. I believe it would make a contribution to correcting the present economic situation if resources were used more efficiently and more selectively on the lines of the recommendations made in the Devlin report. One of the matters which have been the subject of a great deal of consideration in recent months has been Government policy and national attitudes [2185] to the problems affecting our people in the North of Ireland. One of the difficulties is the need to examine carefully how performance matches promise and how the implementation of policy in both parts of the country measures up to undertakings given. The Taoiseach has had occasion to speak recently on the attitude adopted here in respect of what is regarded as the majority of the people in the North of Ireland. From time to time references have been made and reassurances given which would seem to indicate that there is a clear commitment to the concepts, policies and approaches this party has consistently advocated over the years. This matter has been the subject of many references by the Taoiseach over the last 12 months. It has been the subject matter of a great deal of discussion since the State was established. Briefly, I want to refer now to some of the matters dealt with by the Taoiseach in his concluding remarks in order to show that action was taken a long time ago, when it was in certain respects less easy to deal with the situation and when there was not the same encouragement from all parts of this House. As far back as February, 1957, the Government decided that, with a view to the preparation of specific detailed proposals for the integration of the national territory, each Department should undertake forthwith, in respect of matters with which it is concerned, an intensive study of all the practical problems that may be expected to arise in that connection, including problems relating to harmonisation, subject to due allowance for the legitimate legal and sectional interest, of policies and methods concerning agricultural and industrial development, social services, health services, education and other matters and that, for the purposes of the said, it may be assumed (a) provisionally that a separate legislature with powers corresponding to those at present exercised by the Six County Parliament will be created or recognised in respect of either the present Six County area or a smaller area such as the area in which those who are at present opposed to reintegration form a homogeneous [2186] majority and (b) that the powers at present reserved by the British Parliament will be transferred to a parliament for all Ireland. That decision was taken in February, 1957. Prior to that decision there was a good deal of consideration of many matters and eventually the study undertaken and the discussions between the different Departments culminated in the Government decision to which I have referred. It would be interesting to know what happened. What action was taken on foot of that decision in the years that have elapsed since? The Government went out of office shortly afterwards and, so far as we were concerned, we had no further direct responsibility, but some reference has been made recently to the need for reassuring the majority in the Six County area about their position, to the desire to ensure that they would have their views respected and, as the Taoiseach said, that they would have equality of treatment and fair dealings. At the very inception of the State this party guaranteed equality of treatment for all minorities and zealously safeguarded rights in respect of public appointments and in respect of the minority's position in the community. It is not necessary now to recall the criticism and opposition that policy met with, but it is right to recall that one of the matters recently the subject of reference by the Taoiseach has been an undertaking or a promise to carry out certain amendments of Article 44. 1 of the Constitution. It is only right we should discuss this because it is only on the basis of what has been done or is proposed to be done that we can judge the effectiveness of the undertakings given. Some four years ago the Taoiseach's predecessor invited Deputies of both the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to sit on an all-Party Committee. Some of the comments made in respect of the undertakings given by the Taoiseach in relation to the proposed amendment have been welcome. We want to see what has happened in practice. The Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil participated in [2187] a joint committee which examined a variety of questions and made a number of recommendations. After 17 meetings and after examining with care the problems brought before it, the committee brought in a report in December, 1967. Not a single recommendation included in that report has yet been implemented. The only point that emerged from it—something that was not in the recommendations—was the referendum, and this was one of the matters on which there was not agreement. I would add that this committee decided in the early stages to present a report in such a form that where a matter was unanimously recommended it would be so stated and where agreement was not possible the different views would be presented and the matter put forward in that fashion. One of the aspects of the Article that has been the subject of discussion is that it created differences and difficulties for religious groups, particularly for non-Catholics. The present Taoiseach has committed himself to the view that this Article should be repealed and, as the signature of his predecessor is also on the report, it would appear that he also is committed to this course. It is right that we examine the origin of this Article. It did not come from the clouds, nor did it come from some external influence, but it was put into the Constitution by Fianna Fáil. The problems that have been raised by this Article were introduced by Fianna Fáil over 30 years ago. I want to contrast the terms of this Article with the terms of the comparable Article of the 1922 Constitution. Article 8 states: Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen, and no law may be made either directly or indirectly to endow any religion, or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof or give any preference, or impose any disability on account of religious belief or religious status, or affect prejudicially [2188] the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious instruction at the school, or make any discrimination as respects State aid between schools under the management of different religious denominations or divert from any religious denomination or any educational institution any of its property except for the purpose of roads, railways, lighting, water or drainage works or other work of public utility, and on payment of compensation. That Article in respect of religion was removed from the Constitution and in its place the Article we are now discussing was inserted. The present Article has been the subject of signature by a former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach and an announcement by the present Fianna Fáil Taoiseach that it has caused offence and difficulties for non-Catholics in the North of Ireland and even in this part of Ireland. Fianna Fáil introduced this problem and we are now retracing our steps the offence caused to people is not being paid for by Fianna Fáil but is being paid for in the religious problems that have been created. The impression is being created that sectarianism has crept into Irish society. There was not any sectarianism in the Article I have quoted. There were guarantees for everybody to practise freely their religion and effective guarantees that they would be allowed to do this. I would add that the same rights were guaranteed in respect of freedom of expression and opinion. How long will this country tolerate a situation in which the ordinary people have to pay for Fianna Fáil mistakes? I do not think anyone doubts that the Taoiseach himself believes what he says in this regard, and perhaps his predecessor also believed what he said, but nothing has been done about the report issued two and half years ago. Although no action whatever was taken in this matter, every scribe who could get a pen to paper applauded the benevolence, the tolerance and the foresight of a Government who were prepared to eradicate what they introduced into the Constitution. [2189] The unit that was established to examine this matter remained in obscurity for several months. However, there was a much broader, more clearly-defined decision taken in respect of these matters, but nothing was done. Therefore, how can anyone believe that the Government mean to implement what they say? I do not doubt that some members of the present Government believe what they say, but are they free to put these decisions into effect? The Taoiseach has rightly referred, as we have referred in the course of many debates in this House, to discrimination in the north in respect of voting, in respect of housing and in respect of employment. Recently, attention was directed to the problem of reforming the RUC and the disbandment or disarming of the B Specials. We must contrast our criticism of that with some of the terms incorporated in the Criminal Justice Bill. We must contrast our demand for equal voting rights with the gerrymandering that was carried on by the Taoiseach's colleague, the former Minister for Local Government, when he cut through boundaries of townlands and spent weeks arguing in this House —now he is not allowed to speak either inside or outside the House. We must contrast discrimination in respect of housing in the north with our own problem in the matter of housing. In the matter of employment we must contrast the discrimination shown in the north with the fact that in this part of the country it can be effectively shown that the way to secure employment is by membership of the Fianna Fáil Party. When we look at the local authority reform that has been advocated in the north of Ireland we contrast that with the fact that we have here the largest municipal authority in the country suppressed and not allowed to exercise its rights on behalf of the people. We will be judged as a nation on our implementing what we are demanding in respect of all our people in the north—Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter. A great deal of lip service has been paid from time to time to [2190] Wolfe Tone. Although he was of the minority h","","","","","","","","","",,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2900441,766,8,142,"Private Members' Business. - Health (Provision of Information) Bill, 1997 (Seanad): Second Stage.",25/03/1997,Dr. Tom Moffatt,Fianna Fáil,Mayo East,"I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on the Bill. As everybody knows, cancer is a major killer, up to 7,500 people per annum. It reflects well on the health services that we are thinking about the introduction of screening programmes. In years gone by the biggest killer was TB. Anything that will help in the early detection of cancers is welcome. The cancers most amenable to screening are cancer of the breast and cervix. Early detection in many cases means better results. In others, the prognosis depends on the types of cancer cells present. Prevention is better than cure. We should start perhaps with what can be done for those who have skin cancer, to which the Celtic race is especially prone. There is a need for an information programme to advise farmers, fishermen and those exposed to excessive sunlight on how to avoid developing this form of cancer. Deputy Cowen mentioned testicular cancer which affects young men especially. It can be detected easily and is amenable to screening. On cancer of the lung, there has been much hype in the American press recently in regard to companies, even at this late stage, acknowledging that there is a definite link with smoking. We have been aware for many years of the link between smoking and cancer. Smoking has been a big killer of men and it is unfortunate that an increased number of women have started smoking in recent years. Lung cancer can be prevented to some extent and we should highlight the risks associated with smoking. Great strides have been made in recent years in the treatment of cancer. I welcome the efforts by the Minister to set up a regionalised treatment [1524] programme as patients do not like to travel too far from home and prefer to be treated in their local hospitals. While surgery and chemotherapy are now available in most county hospitals, the question of the provision of radiotherapy in some hospitals has still not been decided. I recently read that radiotherapy services would not be available in the Western Health Board area for some years. This may be related to the building programme at the University College Hospital, Galway, but I hope this service will come on stream shortly. The provision of palliative care is very important. If people cannot be cured then they should get the best care possible. Cancer patients worry about what will happen to them and how their families and relatives will cope. Palliative care not only helps to ameliorate pain but also helps families deal with psychological problems. The palliative care programme has progressed very satisfactorily in recent years. Palliative care should be provided at home by the general practitioner and the palliative care team. If this is not possible then it should be provided by district or county hospitals. In most cases palliative care can be provided on a domiciliary basis. We must ensure that this care is provided to patients in their areas. We need to carry out further research in this area.

3278418,868,8,112,"Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001: Second Stage.",08/03/2002,Mr. John O'Donoghue,Fianna Fáil,Kerry South,"I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate. The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001, is essentially a practical piece of legislation which combines some significant provisions with others which, while somewhat mundane in nature, are worthy of implementation. Deputy Shatter noted the need to have access to a wider pool of individuals in so far as appointment to judicial office is concerned. He acknowledged past measures directed towards achieving this aim. Regarding the reference in my speech to rights of audience, I assure Deputy Shatter that this is not intended in any way to cut down the plain words of the section which are contained in the Bill. Eligibility will include those acting either as an advocate or as a solicitor instructing counsel or both. It would be healthy for the development of the profession of solicitors if more solicitors were to follow Deputy Shatter's example and exercise their right of audience. This, as he correctly pointed out, has been available to solicitors for more than 30 years, courtesy of Deputy O'Malley's Bill. Deputies Shatter and Mitchell mentioned the need for greater transparency in the appointment of judges. I have some difficulty with the idea of an Oireachtas committee to deal with this issue. It might be difficult to devise a mode of operation which would not encroach upon the independence of the judiciary. The judicial appointments advisory board has already made an impact by providing a structure which puts an element of distance between the selection of judges and the political process. In this Bill further transparency measures are being provided for. This is definitely an area in which we need to make haste slowly, as the Romans might have put it. The administration of justice is such a central element in our society that the introduction of any fundamental change warrants considered and cautious scrutiny. I note what has been said about the need to provide more resources for the lower courts, especially by Deputy Penrose. I will introduce an amendment to the Bill during the course of its passage which will expand the range of quasi-judicial powers available to county registrars and this will considerably relieve the burden on Circuit Court judges. Deputy Penrose made the point that because of the change of jurisdiction of the Circuit Court we will need to appoint an additional 20 judges. I hope Deputy Penrose was not suggesting that we demote 20 High Court judges. Deputy Shatter dealt with the question of extra Circuit Court judges. I will consider the position of the Circuit Court when the additional jurisdiction is conferred upon [884] it. It is too early now to estimate the exact impact but I accept that there will be an impact. It is likely to take some time for the effects of the initial extension of the jurisdiction to be felt in the Circuit Court. On a serious note, I acknowledge Deputy Penrose's point that there will be a need for additional resources. We will need to consider that seriously. Perhaps the transfer of resources, as opposed to personnel, would be appropriate. In any event, the change of jurisdiction will result in additional resources. It is not possible, however, for me to quantify that now. Deputy Shatter adverted to delays in the Central Criminal Court. The backlog is decreasing. Judges will shortly return to the High Court. The benchmarking body chaired by Mr. Justice Quirke will report by the end of June. With regard to the resources available to the High Court, the appointment of two High Court judges must be considered in tandem with the proposal to expand the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, thereby relieving pressure on the High Court. Deputy O'Kennedy also referred to delays in the Central Criminal Court. I intend to increase the number of judges by two and hope to see judges returning from other work later in the year. Under this Bill, the High Court will deal with less civil work due to the transfer of civil work to the Circuit Court. That, at least, is what is expected. The Courts Service Board has recently established a committee to look into the distribution of business across the various courts. This will include a look at the Central Criminal Court. I wrote to the Chief Justice asking him to consider the jurisdiction of the courts. I would see great merit in a court which combined the jurisdictions of the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Court. A court such as this would lead to a greater degree of expedience in serious criminal cases. The Chief Justice took this very seriously and has referred it for examination. We are waiting to hear from him and are awaiting a report on the matter. Deputy Penrose criticised the lack of consultation rooms in courthouses. We have considerably improved the courthouse stock in recent years. This year we are providing more than €26 million for courthouse accommodation. We are also investigating the possibility of using PPPs to advance the building plan. Deputy O'Malley wanted to know why there was a need to specify long periods of practice requirements for judges. I acknowledge that he has a point with regard to the traditional approach which underlines the provisions concerning judicial appointments. However, there can sometimes be merit in adhering to traditions when they prove themselves to have worked in practice. These traditions have been working in practice for several hundred years, as he pointed out. The practice approach to judicial appointments is a feature of our common law. The training approach is, rather, a feature of a civil law system and would require considerably more in terms of analysis and assessment before such a sea-change could be effected. That is not to say I [885] agree with the motto stating that not only will they not be changed but they are unwilling to be changed. Deputy O'Malley mentioned also that some matters in the Bill could have been dealt with through regulation. I understand his point of view and this is something we could consider for future legislation. The problem with a Bill such as this is that it is like an acorn it continues to grow. I note Deputy Barnes's point about the need for a more fundamental look at the way in which our courts operate. The Chief Justice has announced the establishment of a working group to examine the jurisdiction of the courts. Mr. Justice Finlay is the chair of that group and there are representatives of various people who have an interest in the operation of the courts. The first module with deal extensively with criminal law and the second with civil law. The third module, as I stated in my speech will consider such general changes to the court's structure as may be necessary in the light of the conclusions of the first and second modules and any other considerations which the working group considers relevant. It is an ambitious undertaking and will mean a fundamental look at the way in which our courts are organised. The aim is to ensure that access for our citizens is improved and that the mechanisms through which justice is delivered are not only efficient and fair but are seen to be so. I note what Deputy Howlin said in relation to his Private Members' Bill. It has already been indicated that provision for an additional three circuit judges will be made by way of Committee Stage amendment. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate and efficient way to proceed. I urge Deputies on all sides of the House to co-operate in ensuring that this Bill passes speedily through the House. Deputy Howlin also referred to the need for judicial accountability legislation. The Deputy will be aware that I had proposals in this area, consisting of a constitutional amendment followed by legislation to establish a judicial council and ethics committee, but that I felt compelled to withdraw the proposals because of the failure of the main Opposition parties to support them. However, I remain convinced of the need for action in this area and in particular the need for a judicial ethics and oversight body. In that respect, preliminary work on the proposals has continued in my Department. I draw the attention of the Deputies to various aspects of the operation of the Courts Service. The Government's commitment to ensuring the success of the service is reflected in the allocation to the courts of a Vote of €84. 9 million in 2002. We have also substantially increased the resources of the Courts Service since its establishment, allowing for the development of a new management structure responsible for planning and implementing the necessary organisational changes to ensure that the Courts Service fulfils its mandate. I am also pleased that we have considerably increased the allocation for courthouses during the lifetime of the Government from €11. 3 [886] million in 1997 to more than €31 million in 2002. The evidence of this can be seen all over the country in new and refurbished courthouses. It is important that developments continue to move apace. In this context I have recently been presented with a report which considers the merits of establishing a commercial court in Ireland which would be accessible electronically and which could develop links with arbitration centres. The report and recommendations prepared by the committee on court practice and procedures, chaired by the Honourable Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, proposes that e-courts should be developed throughout the court system and that the development of an e-commercial court would underpin and reinforce Ireland's position as an e-commerce hub, and recommends that a commercial court be developed in the High Court in Dublin. The Government attaches great importance to the provision of e-services as quickly as possible. The effectiveness of the courts is of considerable importance in underpinning the economic success of the country and supporting the continued ability of the Government to attract and retain foreign investment. Electronic services offer the potential to maximise operational efficiencies, reduce paper logjams, assist in reducing court waiting times and generally provide a much improved level of service for all court users. Internationally, the trend is towards the provision of electronic services in court environments. E-courts offer real potential to place Ireland as a hub for the settlement of commercial and e-commerce disputes, and significantly improve the perception of Ireland as a location for commercial investment. I have asked the Courts Service board to look at the implications of the report. I recognise fully the potential that IT has to make a major contribution to the future development of the Courts Service. New information and communications technologies will facilitate the provision of a world class model of service delivery. In recognition of this, my Department is providing €9. 4 million for IT developments. It can be seen that the benefits of the IT programme within the courts are becoming more exciting. Further progress is being achieved on a day by day basis. The importance of judicial training and preparation of our judges to deal with the new challenges which confront them cannot be overestimated. Some Deputies referred to the question of judicial training. I have explained that it is not a feature of common law, but more a feature of other jurisdictions which operate on the basis of codes. Judicial training in this jurisdiction is a matter for the Judiciary which under the Constitution is independent in the exercise of its functions. The Courts Service is responsible for the funding of this training and has made significant funds available to the Judicial Studies Institute for that purpose. Funding has been substantially increased in recent years. The Judicial Studies [887] Institute has put in place a comprehensive programme of training for judges, which I am sure everybody will welcome. It will be clear, through the major investment programme in both information systems and buildings, that we have demonstrated a commitment to ensure the Courts Service has the necessary infrastructure to discharge its responsibilities and at the same time support the judicial system. Enactment of the Bill will also support this commitment and ensure a modern and progressive courts system, Judiciary and Courts Service which will serve the needs of all who use our courts.

740884,251,2,88,"Committee on Finance. - Local Government (County Administration) Bill, 1950—Committee Stage.",14/02/1951,Mr. Peadar Cowan,Clann na Poblachta,Dublin North-East,"We are dealing with this Bill on the basis that they have not been a success. I have discovered that, although you may have the one man as city manager of Dublin and county manager of Dublin County, such an arrangement does not make for co-ordination between the Dublin County Council and the Dublin City Council. In the Dublin City Council we do our own business relating to the city. We have nothing to do with county matters. When our city manager is with us, he deals with city matters. When he goes to the county council he deals entirely with county council matters. He may worry perhaps at night when he goes to bed about some of his difficulties. The water supply has been mentioned. The City of Dublin supplies water to parts of the Dublin County Council area and the county council pays us for that [118] water. It is arranged under the regional water supply which has been projected, and which I hope, at some time, will become law, that water may be sent from Dublin as far as Wexford. Does that mean then that the county manager of Dublin will have to be the county manager of Wicklow and Wexford as well? There is no sense in that argument. Deputy MacEntee got into this discussion to say a few offensive things about me and about Partition. I do not know what good that is to Deputy MacEntee. Whether he can sleep better after having made an observation like that, I do not know. I am only concerned to have this Bill improved as best we can, and I am very sorry that we have not some member of the Dublin County Council here to talk of the system from his experience. The system does not lead to any co-ordination. It imposes unnecessary work on the Dublin County Manager and we have reached a position now that when the Dublin County Manager goes from the City Hall to Parnell Square he changes his title on the way. He is city manager in the City Hall and until he reaches the county council headquarters in Parnell Square and then he becomes county officer. From Deputy MacEntee's point of view there may be something wonderful to be said for that, but in actual fact there is no co-ordination, except theoretical co-ordination by this arrangement. The Dublin City Manager as county manager deals with county affairs only and not with city affairs. These two things are kept just as much apart as they always were. When he moves up to Parnell Square he has the county council staff to advise him on county council matters such as the housing of people in Coolock or the provision of water or sewerage in Balbriggan and he deals with them. He has to forget everything about the city when in the county council office in Parnell Square, and yet I am told that is co-ordination. I put down these amendments deliberately, having thought the matter over, believing that the city manager is overworked, that there is an enormous amount of work in Dublin City for the city manager and that there is a [119] big amount of work, if we want county officers at all, that can be done in the County Dublin by a county officer and I say to the Minister that he should provide a county officer for the County Dublin. It is for that purpose that I have put down these amendments— not for that precise purpose, because that purpose would not be achieved by the amendments. The amendments only relate in the first instance to temporary appointments. That is as far as Section 9 (5) is concerned which deals with temporary appointments when there is a vacancy. Sub-section (4) of Section 10 deals with the first county officers and it provides that the City Manager of Dublin shall be the first county officer for the County Dublin. I think it is time that we gave County Dublin a county officer of its own and, if we did, he would have work enough to do and he would relieve the Dublin City Manager of the enormous burden of responsibility placed upon him. No one individual can do all the work that the Dublin City Manager is called upon to do as Manager of Dublin, Manager of County Dublin and Manager of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire. If he can do all that work efficiently, and apparently he is doing all that enormous amount of work efficiently, then we could have one county officer to do the duties of about ten counties elsewhere.",14/02/1951,13,240,241,to say a few offensive things about me and about Partition I do not know what good that is to,Deputy MacEntee,Whether he can sleep better after having made an observation like that I do not know I am only concerned,Deputy MacEntee,740884_2,,to say a few offensive things about me and about Partition I do not know what good that is to Deputy MacEntee Whether he can sleep better after having made an observation like that I do not know I am only concerned,to say a few offensive things about me and about Partition I do not know what good that is to Whether he can sleep better after having made an observation like that I do not know I am only concerned,text336,2,3,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.336472237,0.008411806,0.090124913,0.002253123,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.585585586,0.580580581,0.570570571,0.546546547,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3908500,2016,14,83,Education Cuts: Motion.,29/10/2008,Ms. Joanna Tuffy,The Labour Party,Dublin Mid West,"In putting down this motion, the Labour Party is defending progress made in the education system such as the reduction of class sizes, tackling educational disadvantage and getting more students to stay in school and go on to college. Initiatives that have contributed to this progress have been generated across the political spectrum. Thanks must be paid to teachers, students and parents for their part in this regard. Much of the progress has been the result of initiatives introduced by the former Member, Niamh Bhreathnach, when she was the Labour Party’s Minister for Education. She published [281]the first and only White Paper on education, charting its future direction. She introduced programmes to tackle educational disadvantage including the leaving certificate applied, Breaking the Cycle and the Early Start programmes while expanding the transition year programme and abolishing third level fees. The progress that followed included increased participation by school leavers in third level, including those from the lower socio-economic groups. Clondalkin, in my Dublin Mid-West constituency, was one of the postal districts analysed by the Higher Education Authority for its report on who goes to college. Clondalkin’s participation rates in third level increased from 12. 7% in 1998 to 22. 8% in 2004. More needs to be done but progress has been made. The same report found that more people from disadvantaged backgrounds stayed on in school, thanks to the very programmes introduced by Niamh Bhreathnach, in particular the leaving certificate applied programme. In 2004, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, commissioned a report on the transition year which assessed its success. It found that students who took the transition year did better in the leaving certificate and were more likely to go to college. One problem highlighted, however, was those schools which carry the transition programme need proper funding for the programmes to be successful. I have seen the progress in education in Dublin Mid-West at first hand. I am sure my constituency colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and Deputy Paul Gogarty, the chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science, have also seen them. Last week I met with students from Collinstown Park community college, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery tonight, who are here to defend the progress made in their school. They told me how valuable programmes such as the leaving certificate applied, the leaving certificate vocational, the transition year and the junior certificate programme were to them. One leaving certificate applied student told me he did not think he would be still at school but for the programme. A leaving certificate vocational programme student told me he hoped the programme would provide him with the opportunity to go on to third level as it provides gateway subjects. Transition year students told me how the programme was an opportunity for them to mature and make better decisions about their future studies and careers. Collinstown Park community college sends many more students to third level, into jobs and apprenticeships than it did a decade ago. This is mirrored in all the other schools throughout the Dublin Mid-West constituency in Lucan and Clondalkin. Funding for these programmes will be cut and schools in Dublin Mid-West will lose tens of thousands of euro. Many of the schools will lose two or three teachers. What will these cuts mean for individuals? The cuts will mean individuals will drop out of school. The doubling of the third level registration fee will force many others to drop out of college. Individuals who would have stayed on to participate in properly funded junior certificate support programmes and vocational leaving certificate programmes will be in danger of dropping out of school. Some schools may cease to offer the transition year because it will be too costly to run. As it was, many schools could not offer the programme because it was too costly to run properly. There will be larger class sizes, Travellers will drop out and some schools will have to cut less popular subjects, such as physics, because they will not have the teachers to provide them. Children who need language support will lose out, as will their class mates. A local school in my constituency has informed me it will lose three foreign national TEFL teachers because of the new cap. Students will perform poorly because of larger classes and other cuts, resulting in their career and further study options being diminished. [282]They will be faced by all of the cuts. Disadvantaged schools and those on the threshold will be hit hardest by these cuts. They will be affected by larger class sizes, restrictions on substitution teachers and cuts in various programmes, such as the leaving certificate applied and vocational options and transition year. Many of these schools are in Dublin Mid-West, a constituency represented by the Green Party’s Deputy Paul Gogarty, chairman of the Oireachtas education committee. These cuts are a mistake. We should be investing in education and building on progress. We must ensure that through investing in education we build our economy again. I have already argued progress can be made in all social areas during harder economic times. There are examples in history where governments in hard economic times invested in education, social welfare, health and housing. Poland, which is much poorer than Ireland, is investing more in education. Ireland will lose out in economic competitiveness in the future to such countries. The purpose of being in government is to make progress on the issues one cares most about. The Green Party, and in particular Deputy Paul Gogarty, made education one of these issues. With these cuts, the progress made in the education system in disadvantaged areas such as Dublin Mid-West, represented by Deputy Gogarty, will be reversed. The Green Party and the Government is on the wrong side of progress in education.",29/10/2008,30,254,255,by Niamh Bhreathnach in particular the leaving certificate applied programme In 2004 the then Minister for Education and Science Deputy,Mary Hanafin,commissioned a report on the transition year which assessed its success It found that students who took the transition year,Mary Hanafin,3908500_2,,by Niamh Bhreathnach in particular the leaving certificate applied programme In 2004 the then Minister for Education and Science Deputy Mary Hanafin commissioned a report on the transition year which assessed its success It found that students who took the transition year,by Niamh Bhreathnach in particular the leaving certificate applied programme In 2004 the then Minister for Education and Science Deputy commissioned a report on the transition year which assessed its success It found that students who took the transition year,text596,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.389111414,0.009727785,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.921921922,0.872872873,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1718784,303,8,86,"Wealth Tax Bill, 1975: Report Stage (Resumed).",24/07/1975,Vivion de Valera,Fianna Fáil,Dublin North-West,"As on the previous amendment, I do not wish to repeat Deputy Colley's arguments in [455] a parrot-like way though I support them. I want to put them in a slightly different form. Deputy Colley has quite rightly based his case in the first instance on page 60 of the White Paper on Capital Taxation laid by the Minister for Finance before each House of the Oireachtas on 28th February, 1974. In that official document the question of capital taxation was analysed. There was a foreword by the Minister for Finance. Various parties were invited to make recommendations not later than the end of June, 1974. June, 1974, was about nine months before April, 1975. On that point, we all know how long it takes to deal with representations. We have had plenty of experience in this House of the delay involved and the time it takes to provide for legislation. Having regard to the novelty, the scope and the likely volume of the subsequent legislation, that nine months—the minimum time to consider the legislation in question— seemed to anyone who knew about these things to be rather short, that is, always assuming the Minister was serious in inviting representations and was willing to consider fully and give due weight to representations, that he was not just bluffing people and telling them to send in their recommendations and then virtually putting them in the wastepaper basket when they came in. The point I am making is that the indication in the foreword was that it would take some time to prepare that legislation after the date in June. As I have said, the proposals were novel and far-reaching. We then come to page 45 of the same Government document and it says in paragraph 93: The wealth of the taxpayer would be valued on, say, the last day of the tax year, at present the 5th April. As a fixed annual date invites evasion, safeguards would be introduced to protect the tax base from artificial depreciation of the market value of assets. That is a most material paragraph in respect of what Deputy Colley is urging. It says: 'at present the 5th [456] April' and there has never been any suggestion of an immediate change of that date. In fact, in changing the law not so very long ago in regard to the financial year the tax difficulties were such, if I understand the picture correctly, that the tax date could not be adjusted to the end of the calendar year as many other things were, including rates. It was this Government who made the adjustment in regard to rates. Right through the debate it has been clear the 5th April stands and that being so nobody could be under the illusion that the tax date was to be changed from 5th April notwithstanding the use of the words 'at present the 5th April'. On page 45 of the Government's own White Paper there is the statement that the wealth tax would be valued on, say, the last day of the tax year, at present 5th April. It would be valued on 5th April as, indeed, the Minister proposes to do. This is a material consideration. Anybody reading that would say that the tax date was as it is, 5th April. The safeguards to protect the taxpayer from artificial depreciation of market values of assets is mentioned there, but, of course, that was done, amongst other things, by the warnings given. No argument can be made out of that warning because that warning synchronised with the date of the issue of the White Paper and nothing could be read into that warning. It was simply a warning that said: 'Now you have got notice of what we are going to do, from the time of this notice the intention will operate.' The warning gave no indication whatever of date. The fact that it was synchronised with the appearance of the White Paper deprived that fact of any significance as to when the tax was to come in. The Minister cannot invoke that point to qualify the argument I am basing on paragraph 93. On page 60 the final paragraph reads: The date of commencement will be 6th April, 1975. The new system of capital taxation will, therefore, be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76. The Minister is jumping because he thinks he has the answer but he has [457] not. The words used are: 'from the tax year', and a year is a year. If the Minister wants it we can argue whether it is from the beginning of the year or from the end of the year. That argument can be answered by the argument we are making about 6th of April, the date of commencement. The point is that anybody reading this paper would come to the conclusion that the tax assessable on 5th of April would be assessable at the end of the financial year in question. That is Deputy Colley's point. He holds that it should, therefore, be on the 5th of April, 1976 which would be the last day of the financial year 1975. Firstly, we had the Minister's foreword. Secondly, the paragraph on page 45 '...would be valued on the last day of the tax year...' and that would be 5th April, 1976. Lastly, the 6th of April, 1975, would be the first day of the year in question. In other words taking the 6th April, 1975, that could only be 5th April, 1976, as the first day of the year, as would be the custom, and taking the last day as 5th April, that would correspond to what is in the White Paper. That, in a nutshell, is the case Deputy Colley has made on the White Paper. It is a fair case that the capital taxation will be fully operated from the year 1975-76. I do not think that is a strange interpretation. This argument cannot be brushed aside by saying: 'What is in a day?' It is not what is in a day there is much more involved in it than that. It is what is in a year. Deputy Colley has given reasons about the time factors and the uncertainties. Firstly, I want to get that argument clearly on the record to test the credibility of Governments for the future, and the present Government in particular. I do not want to use the word 'credibility' in a pejorative sense I want to use it in the simple meaning of the word. I do not want to use it in the sense of vulgar abuse. The Minister for Finance has more than once on Committee Stage claimed when we were making an argument that the people who would be concerned [458] would be mainly people who knew what it was all about and who would have readily available expert advice. Let me take the Minister for Finance up on that. Deputy Esmonde may have a different opinion to mine, but would one fault an accountant or a barrister who might be more cautious and suspicious? Would you fault an accountant who read that White Paper and said to a client: 'You had better get ready for this, certain things are fixed as of 28th February, the day the White Paper was issued but reading the Minister's foreword, people have up to the end of June to make representations.' Could one be faulted for saying that page 45 says it will be the end of the tax year and the tax date, for all we know—there is no sign of it being changed—is 5th April, the last day of the financial year? The custom is that tax is assessed at the end of a year. Would you fault an accountant, a solicitor or even a barrister—who, from training and wide experience normally is conditioned to being suspicious—would you blame any of these men, much less the knowledgeable client the Minister for Finance has so often postulated, for coming to the conclusion that the first time tax would be payable would be on the 5th April, 1976? Would that be an impossibly rash or mistaken view of the White Paper? We have given our interpretation here. But I submit to the Minister that it is not to be brushed aside with the facile answer 'what is in a day?' The sentence that the system of capital taxation will therefore be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76 cannot be used to refute the argument. I will read that sentence again. 'The system of capital taxation will, therefore, be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76.' There are two words to be noted in that—'from' and 'fully'. The tax year 1975-76 ends on the 5th April, 1976. Can you blame anyone for saying that taxation will be fully operative from the end of that year? What does the word 'fully' mean? We have already had capital gains tax, which is operative in the [459] year 1974-75. The capital acquisitions tax will be operative and would have been expected to be operative in the current year 1974-75. These Acts were going to be operative anyway from the 28th February, 1974. Under the notice given the Act was partly operative from the 27th February, 1974. The capital gains tax, of its nature, could be expected to be operative during the year 1974-75. The capital acquisitions tax could be expected to be operative in that year also, because nobody in their senses could expect a complete moratorium on death duties for a year. In spite of the marginal note in the Finance Act that death duties are abolished estate duty was suspended but, from the 5th April, 1975, legacy duty, or whatever one likes to call it, death duties in another form, continue. If there is any doubt about it I have that document which was circulated to solicitors bearing out what I mentioned this morning. I can quite understand the Minister saying to me: what are you at? I am at a very simple point, the meaning of the word 'fully'. If the new system of capital taxation was to be fully operative in the year 1974-75 why say it will therefore be fully operative in the year 1975-76 as is said in this White Paper? The whole system of capital taxation is already partially operative in the year 1974-75. It is partially operative in the current year 1975-76. It will be fully operative only from the tax year 1975-76. I have made the point that 'from' means from the end of the year. If I say it is such and such a distance from a certain road I normally mean from the end of the road nearest me. In the same way, if I say from a period of time the normal meaning is that it is operative from the end of that period of time. In fact what that sentence means is that this system of capital taxation will not be fully operative until the end of the current year, the year 1975-76. If all the provisions entailed in the capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax are legally fully operative in the current year, and even if parts of them were not, certainly it is a fair [460] assumption that this sentence indicates that it was visualised that some part of this legislation was not going to be fully operative in the current year. On the terms of the Wealth Tax Bill, and with the explicit statements on pages 45 and 60 of the White Paper, it was a very fair inference that the reference to the part that would not be fully operative was the wealth tax. I am trying to present the case, the White Paper, on a factual basis. I want to present Deputy Colley's point in a logical and legal way. This White Paper goes to the credibility of the Administration in this matter. In repetition and summary, the Minister's foreword signed 'Richie Ryan', dated 28th February, 1974, on page III the statement on page 45 I have quoted the statement on page 60 to which Deputy Colley adverted more than once, and that I have now parsed in its context. I affirm and plead that that would have left any responsible adviser in the position of expecting that the date on which the burden would become operative or the wealth tax would become fully operative would be the 5th April next, not 5th April, 1975. That is not a trivial argument. The consequences are serious for all concerned. They are serious for the Revenue Commissioners administratively, no matter what one can say. One can lay the best plans in anticipation but we know, and I am sure the Revenue Commissioners and the other Departments of State have all had experience of this, it is very hard to get work under way and to reach finality until you know essentially what you are catering for. There have been many amendments to these Bills. It would be asking too much of the Revenue Commissioners, even with their computers and with the relief that they are expecting in the estate duty office. That is slightly illusory it will be simply transferring their activities. They do not yet know precisely, though I suppose they know perhaps 90 per cent, what they are up against, but that psychological factor is there among the staff, and when the flag [461] comes down they will be up against all these problems familiar to those of us who have had to organise a project. It is just like a political party when it comes to an election. There could be talk about a general election for months before with everybody preparing, but it is only when the Taoiseach comes out and says that the Dáil is dissolved that one goes into action. It is amazing the amount of work that perhaps could have been done beforehand that now has to be done. From the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, and the taxpayers this is a hurried measure and it will lead to errors and errors will lead to more trouble for the Revenue Commissioners. It will lead to disputes about interest, genuine mistakes, evasion, how to distinguish which is which and so on. When I used the word 'credibility' I did not do so in a pejorative way. What I am urging the Minister is to realise the necessity for good faith and, even at Report Stage it is not too late to make the necessary amendment when it is appreciated what is in this. That is the case presented as I have presented it and there is no need to go back on what Deputy Colley said. The principle of making a tax legally due and payable months before the legislation is imposed is something that has to be done when notice is given in order to avoid evasion. I have no quarrel whatever with the restrictions that were put on when notice was given on 28th February. When you go beyond that it is a very undesirable development in taxation to introduce at the one time extensions of the liability to assess oneself, extensions of the penalties through interest bearing, and then to add to that an extension of the idea that you can create a tax liability retrospectively. These things are bad in principle, and when they are bad in principle they will inevitably lead to various difficulties. Remember we are not living in the old days, we are living in an unstable world. To quote Deputy [462] Colley, we are imposing a tax legally due and payable months back after the passing of this Bill. There is food for thought. Deputy Colley said that there was a bit of a mystery about the rushing of this legislation. Here I am going to be frankly political, as I am entitled to be. Everything I have said on this amendment to date was meant to be helpful, constructive, objective, a fair, intelligent legal interpretation of the situation—the type of thing that if I were wearing a wig I would present to the court. That was my approach. Let me, so to speak, now take off my wig and put on another hat and become the politician. If I am the politician I can give a pretty simple answer to the mystery that Deputy Colley finds in this. The mystery is simple. Capital gains was a popular political name: people were worried about the nice little sums of money that speculators made. That Bill then could be called what it was called. In the deliberately political misleading marginal note, to the first Finance Bill, we had a Minister and the Government adumbrating the phrase 'abolition of death duties' when it was, in fact, a suspension of estate duties. I am giving full credit, as I said on that Bill, for the great improvements and I am in favour of a lot of that legislation. The Government did themselves a disservice in what they did there instead of calling that Bill what it was, they called it by the grand name of Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill. Fair enough it is just a little political gimmick. They wanted to pretend that they abolished death duties. They did not, and to my mind they did themselves a disservice because they gave fairly good reliefs. They are arguing a very good thing and for the life of me I cannot see why they did not bring in that Act. Wealth tax sounds good. It is a great name, it is a catchword. They call this a wealth tax when it is really a property tax. I suspect that the rush is a political one. I see no mystery. It is a political point to pretend and say, 'we are going to tax all the rich people. The money we collect will contribute to our economic [463] and social welfare.' The fact is there will not be very much money. The Minister has not told us if that is so, but my guess is that there will not be much money. There are not as many rich people in this country to be made the objects of this scapegoat exercise as some might think. It is being rushed in as something that looks well. Instead, it will cost a lot of money it is at the wrong time it is not achieving its purpose properly, and we, on this side of the House, are all for taxing non-productive wealth. The Minister would be shoving an open door. He has had our arguments about its repercussions on employment and productive wealth. As far as taxing the non-productive and luxurious wealth and so on, we are all with him. We want to know why he has to rush it in at this moment, when it is not going to do anybody any earthly good in the present financial year. Its administration will be complicated and costly. It will be responsible for individual injustice, errors and so on. With that political plea, I supplement the quasi-legal presentation of the points made earlier by Deputy Colley.",24/07/1975,20,2464,2465,That is the case presented as I have presented it and there is no need to go back on what,Deputy Colley,said The principle of making a tax legally due and payable months before the legislation is imposed is something that,Deputy Colley,1718784_8,,That is the case presented as I have presented it and there is no need to go back on what Deputy Colley said The principle of making a tax legally due and payable months before the legislation is imposed is something that,That is the case presented as I have presented it and there is no need to go back on what said The principle of making a tax legally due and payable months before the legislation is imposed is something that,text150,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,-0.039528471,-0.000988212,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.294294294,0.296296296,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1412439,1066,14,86,Committee on Finance. - Vote 26: Local Government (Resumed).,10/03/1970,Mr. David A. Thornley,The Labour Party,Dublin North-West,"To get back from these flippancies, I was trying to illustrate in human terms what I think is a sad point, our failure to provide amenities, places to meet, places of recreation for those who live in these houses and who are now a grown-up generation born in houses, which I admit, the Minister's Government, to a great extent, built. I am trying, in [72] the face of intense provocation, to be polite to the Minister. Turning to the question of B scale rents which has been so much stressed in this debate and which bears particular relevance to the situation and discontent building up in Ballymun, I can understand that some Deputies who participate in the protests against the B scale rents can be accused of band-waggoning and so on. I assure the Minister there is nothing of the sort involved so far as we are concerned. I want to correct one point which Deputy Tunney made in what was otherwise an excellent and most constructive contribution to this debate, when he said he was glad to hear Deputy Keating accepting the principle of the B scale differential rent. What Deputy Keating and this party accept and I accept is the principle of the differential rent as such but we do not accept the manner in which the B scale is operated at present, for many reasons into which I do not propose to go in detail since I think the points have been adequately made. To reiterate three of them, in the first place, we feel that overtime earnings should not be assessed for the purpose of determining B scale rents. This is a disincentive to ordinary people trying to bring up families to doing overtime work. Secondly, the earnings of children should not be brought into assessment in determining these rents. As a nation we tend to marry young. Many people make great sacrifices to educate their children and they are able to avail themselves of their children's earnings for only a very short time. During the same time these young people are thinking of getting married. If they are going to participate in the Minister's purchase schemes they are trying to save deposits and it is quite wrong that in this period their parents should be penalised because of the short-lived fact that the children are earning. Thirdly—and I have raised this point by means of questions in the House and Deputy Tunney quite correctly touched on it also—there is another objection to the B scale system in that it is turning the tenant into, in effect, an accountant. It imposes a strain on [73] him in respect of assessing his own earnings which is not imposed on him by the income tax system. PAYE makes it easier for him to pay income tax than the B scale rent does to pay his rent. If he is not a thrifty, qualified accountant the situation may arise as Deputy Tunney quite correctly pointed out, that a man may do overtime to earn a relatively small sum, say, to get him over the Christmas period or something like that: he does not keep a note of this: it is not his function since he is not an accountant. Six or three months later he gets a snap demand for back-rent of £50 or £100 which is quite beyond his capacity to pay. Then, the whole procedure of eviction is initiated with all the heartbreak that follows. Every Deputy in the House knows, if he sits for an urban area, that what I have said is correct and that it should not be so. I would ask the Minister to persuade the corporation to assume even the function of performing more regular assessments itself and take this obligation away from the people. So long as this iniquitous system exists it should not be operated so as to penalise working people for their work and demand from them sums they cannot possibly meet. Throughout much of the debates that have taken place here and outside about housing since 1966 the concept of what is called the economic rent has been frequently mentioned. I should like to have the concept of an economic rent explained to me. As understood under the B scale by the Minister and his predecessors it seems that this is the concept of a rent which would pay not merely for the tenancy of the house but ultimately would service the capital necessary to build it. As a matter of fact, the corporation tenant on the B scale is not getting anything for nothing he is paying off his house in the same way as somebody on a purchase or building society scheme. But at the end of 20 years the essential difference is that the tenant has nothing to show for his investment he does not own the bricks and mortar within which he lives. This is a wrong philosophy. We [74] should not make the housing of unfortunate, underpaid people the play of the money markets. It is fair enough, perhaps, that middle or higher income groups should subscribe to the workings of the money markets through the operation of the building societies. To digress for a moment, I am not one of those who regard the building societies as sinks of iniquity. They fulfil a useful social function provided, of course, that their interest rates and their running are properly supervised. In this context, moving for a moment to middle income group housing, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his decision to reduce the footage of houses which qualify for grants. This decision was correct but overdue. I have nothing against the building societies but it is wrong that they and the operations of the private money market should be asked to assume so much decisive responsibility for the housing of the lower income groups with the result that the price of basic housing is forced disproportionately upwards. I am sorry to have to refer to a hoary theme, which has been brought up here again and again, but Deputy Tunney very correctly spoke about how removed the process of housing was from the people. I know I lay myself open to a barrage of interruptions from the Minister when I say this but, leaving aside who was right or wrong, I consider no act more calculated to remove the process of housing from the people than the dissolution of the Dublin Corporation. This abolished the people's effective and direct link with the housing authority. It is most regrettable. In all seriousness, I suggest to the Minister that he should let bygones be bygones, stop recriminations about whether the corporation committed suicide under the baneful influence of Labour and Fine Gael, or was slaughtered by the baneful intervention of Fianna Fáil, and reconstitute the body as rapidly as possible, holding the necessary elections if that should be necessary. I should like to raise another point about which I have asked the Minister questions and to which like many [75] other Deputies, I have not received any satisfaction. Deputy Tunney referred to the ignorance of applicants of their rights and the difficulties they encountered in getting information. That is a completely valid point. When I speak of the ignorance of applicants I do not mean they are illiterate or stupid— I do not think the ordinary Dublin working person is either ignorant or stupid—but they are not qualified to tread their way through the complexities of the corporation's priorities. It is not surprising that they are mystified and baffled when they do not find themselves rehoused, when they think people with less claim to rehousing get accommodation. The complexity of the forms baffles them and the long years on the waiting lists erode their dignity. Every attempt should be made to expound their rights to these people so that they may demand them as a right instead of coming to me, to Deputy Tunney and to many others, seeking as a favour what, in fact, is a right. I am seldom so embarrassed as when I get 'thank you' letters from constituents for getting them houses, as if I had worked some mystical bribery on the Dublin Corporation. With very few exceptions, I do not think any Deputy is capable of varying the priorities of the corporation, which are usually justified. Deputy Tunney made an excellent point regarding the placing of corporation officers in specific areas to explain to the people their rights. In this way there might be less competition between Deputies for the granting of imaginary favours. A simpler process of rehousing might be formulated which would allow more opportunity for this House to devote itself to legislation, to the provision of an adequate committee system and other matters. I associate myself with Deputy Tunney on this. If I might make a side point, Dublin North West is one constituency where the four sitting Deputies have an effective working relationship. However much they may differ in party political questions and major issues of legislation—for example, I think the Minister's whole view of housing is inadequate and Deputy Tunney does [76] not—in so far as they are representatives of the community they work as one, and this is as it should be. I should like to support Deputy Tunney's view that the £1,200 limit for the SDA loans is, in the context of modern value of money, quite ridiculous. On this same point of the manner in which the community can be aided to develop—to some extent through the intervention of the Deputy—may I make a particular plea to the Minister? I know all the other Deputies in my constituency, irrespective of party, would associate themselves with this. It is for more rapid and generous aid towards the development of community centres. Voluntary people who have no politics whatever, or may have different politics from mine, in most of the districts of Dublin have made enormous contributions in time, initiative, energy and money in an attempt to provide the amenities that were not previously provided by the Government. I think their energy and initiative should be rewarded and given support by the Government. Although something is being done in this direction I am not satisfied that the effort is adequate. When projects from reputable bodies for the building of community centres come before the corporation, the Minister should do everything possible to provide the necessary funds. The Minister may turn around, as he did today at Question Time, and say 'This is a matter for the corporation it is not my business'. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he cannot have it both ways. The corporation, in the sense of an elected body, no longer exists. Therefore, if there is anyone whom the individual Deputy can approach about the functioning of the corporation, it is the Minister for Local Government. If the Minister is not prepared to accept responsibility for answering questions about the funding of corporation projects, then he should reconstitute a corporation which will accept this responsibility and answer these questions in public. I should like to refer to a point which came up at Question Time and to which the Minister refused to give a satisfactory reply. It is something which, I know, deeply concerns Deputy [77] Tunney. I refer to the level of water supply in Dublin, more particularly in north Dublin. There is no need for me to develop the points already made on this. I know from correspondence with the corporation that a new main is to be provided at some date—it retreats into the distance as times goes on—but the point has now been reached where people cannot use their baths, their lavatories and their wash-hand basins. Some kind of remedial action, if it is possible from the engineering point of view, ought to be taken. However, when pressed about this today in a set of answers—or rather non-answers —the Minister simply washed his hands of any obligation so far as this matter is concerned. In this Conservation Year we should consider very seriously the question of conservation and pollution. Like Deputy Timmins, I am not one who regards conservation for its own sake as a end in itself—here I think I should find myself in agreement with the Minister. From my point of view, given the alternatives of, on the one hand, an attractive view to be seen by people in motorcars or, on the other, a factory giving employment to 50 people, my instant preference would be for the latter, and I do not care who knows this. However, there are aspects of the destruction of the quality of life in our society to which we should pay attention and for which we should have a conscious plan. However, this does not seem to be the case. Obviously, one of these is pollution. The waters of our country, to the preservation of which so much attention has been given, are being increasingly destroyed. It may seem a trivial point and it is one that is cropping up in major cities in Europe and America, but we live in a city which daily gets noisier. If anyone thinks this is trivial they should ask the people who live in the towers of Ballymun. We live in a city where traffic congestion has reached a point where at certain hours of the day virtual immobility descends on the city and the bus services, the mainstay of the ordinary people, are correspondingly affected and are delayed. Speaking for myself, as a car owner I would fully accept a plan [78] which banned private passenger traffic from the centre of the city at certain times of the day. Is there a plan for this? Have we got a policy? If we have I do not think it has been spelled out in the Minister's speech. Have we, in general, got a policy about the shaping pattern of things like houses and the demographic development of houses? Have we a pattern for things like roads? I do not want to return to one of my hobbyhorses, the Buchanan Report, but the Minister himself mentioned it with scant praise. The implication of that report seems to me to be that effective development, with the exception of one or two areas, will stop at a point broadly on the Shannon. The implication seems essentially to be that, while the growth of Dublin will be held back to the extent that it will not become a gargantuan monolith, it will effectively become the head and tail of the country. The implication seems clearly to be that we accept a policy of regionalism which will change the whole face of our country. The Minister praised certain aspects of the report: how we can improve industrialisation in quantity and quality, how we can expect a more satisfactory regional distribution of population and employment. I think the Minister is sincere in this. I think the Minister's vision of Ireland is not the vision of the Buchanan Report. I think his vision is not one where you have four or five cities, with people commuting over vast distances in large cars from areas which will become tourist hinterlands or a cross between dormitory suburbs and tourist hinterlands. The Buchanan Report says, with almost complete detachment, when speaking of the revision of population in remote tourist areas: The parts of the country concerned are mainly in the extreme west. It goes on at another point to talk of smaller places within 30 minutes journey time to large employment residential towns. What a vision for the future of Ireland where a town like Clifden becomes equivalent to the Croydon of London vis-à-vis Galway. [79] I have ranged widely deliberately for two reasons. The interest for me in this debate is that it covers fundamental, down to earth, bread and butter problems and it also raises a whole range of implications of philosophy about the future of our country. I have tried to touch on both because I feel very strongly about them. In my opinion the Government are not being honest in expressing their attitude both towards the Buchanan and the FitzGerald Reports. Regionalism is taking place while the Government temporise and do not tell us what they are going to do about it. I know there are members of the Cabinet who have misgivings about this. The Government would raise themselves in the estimation of the people if they were honest about the Ireland of the future in the context of these reports. Will it be an Ireland, regionalised, Americanised, noisy, polluted, smoke-filled when it will be too late to change and too late to redress that policy? I felt also I had to say something about housing. I am sorry if this sounds like a constituency plug—it is not meant to be—but, having taken my clinic last night, and every Monday night, and having seen the heartbreak behind the Minister's statistics it is all too patently obvious that the juggling with statistics is not an adequate answer to the fact that there is a housing problem, a heartbreaking problem. None of us has learned the solution to it. We should be bending our energies to finding that solution and to alleviating the misery instead of indulging in statistical gymnastics.",10/03/1970,19,2028,2029,this matter is concerned In this Conservation Year we should consider very seriously the question of conservation and pollution Like,Deputy Timmins,I am not one who regards conservation for its own sake as a end in itself-here I think I should,Deputy Timmins,1412439_14,,this matter is concerned In this Conservation Year we should consider very seriously the question of conservation and pollution Like Deputy Timmins I am not one who regards conservation for its own sake as a end in itself-here I think I should,this matter is concerned In this Conservation Year we should consider very seriously the question of conservation and pollution Like I am not one who regards conservation for its own sake as a end in itself-here I think I should,text429,2,4,0,0,40,0.05,2,0.587786665,0.014694667,0.387310929,0.009682773,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.646646647,0.627627628,0.920920921,0.871871872,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
676519,945,8,157,"Local Authorities (Works) Bill, 1949—Second Stage (Resumed).",06/04/1949,Mr. Daniel O'Rourke,Fianna Fáil,Roscommon,"There is nothing, or very little, left which can usefully be said on this Bill. I rise because I am chairman of my county council and I should like to be assured in relation to a few things. In the first place, I will not for a second deny that, under this Bill, a great deal of useful work may be done—in fact, a great deal of necessary work may, and should, be done. There are in every county, certainly in the west, quite a number of small drainage schemes which would be of distinct advantage and undoubtedly, over the years, many of these works have become more and more necessary, because the rivers have become more and more choked up and at the moment there is, as Deputy Coburn says, a great need for the relief of unemployment. So far as I, personally, am concerned, I have no inclination whatever to hinder the passage of the Bill, but, as I say, I want to be assured with regard to some things connected with it. We are asked for co-operation I am asking for co-operation from the Ministerial side, because it is most important. The very simplicity of this Bill is, I think, its chief danger. It is a very simple thing to say that you can walk in on a person's land compulsorily and give him practically no guarantee of compensation. While I see great [2408] possibilities of benefit in the Bill, I see also great possibilities of damage, and that is what I am concerned with. So far as I am concerned, and, I think, so far as our county council is concerned, we would and will be prepared to co-operate, but we do not expect to have to contribute very largely towards the implementation of these schemes. We are in the position at the moment of having a rate of 22/8 in the £ and I think the ratepayers in our county and in all counties throughout the country will resent any further imposition on the rates. That is our great bother. In years gone by, under the 1924 Act, which was more or less a major drainage scheme, and, under the minor drainage scheme of 1928, we contributed and did all that was asked of us, but it is a strange thing that, while that Act did a good deal of useful work, it was not continued. In our county, many more schemes could have been carried out under it, which shows that it was not quite so popular as one would expect. The main reason, I think, was that there was not sufficient outfall for the water and the schemes could not therefore be successful. I should like to be assured that, when the Minister speaks of paying 100 per cent. of the cost, he means to pay 100 per cent. of any damages which may rightfully be claimed by those whose property is damaged. That is a very important point for every local body and now is the time to settle it and not when the Bill becomes an Act when it will be too late. It is quite possible that many of the minor drainage schemes may cost £100, £150 or £200 and it is also quite possible that, in respect of flooding caused in the lower reaches of a river or stream, the compensation might be higher than the amount spent on the work, and unless the Minister clarifies the position and assures us that the 100 per cent. cost which he proposes to pay includes compensation for damaged property, I think we are treading on dangerous ground. I am sure the Minister will make it clear and I would like that this position should be clarified. Deputy Aiken has referred to the burden imposed on county councils in having to lend engineers and staffs. [2409] County Roscommon did perhaps more of that for the size of the county than any other county. We have been doing that for years. Minor employment schemes, bog development schemes and turf production during the emergency were undertaken by the county council staffs. In connection with schemes carried out by the Board of Works a small percentage was paid to the engineers for their work but nothing was paid to the county council. The county council paid the salaries of engineers and clerks in full but got no compensation. That is only one side of the picture. The other side is the neglect that must follow by taking engineers from their work. I have heard members of this Party say that the engineers are not busily engaged now. I entirely deny that. The engineers are very busily engaged at the moment. They have been called on to prepare schemes now—I do not object to it I think it is a useful thing—but they have been diverted from their own work. I think that position should not obtain for an indefinite period. Before the turf production period came to an end, on the representations of various county managers and county councils, it was decided to take this burden off the engineers in most counties. That was a necessary and wise decision. Unless guarantees are forthcoming that all the cost will be borne by the State and that the entire burden will not be placed on our engineers, we will be in a very wrong position. I would like to ask the Minister as to the duration of this Bill. Is it meant to be a permanent measure or will it be operated only for a period? The Minister in office at the moment can make provision only for this year. In fact, as far as the Bill is concerned, no provision at all is made. I am not very good at analysing legislation, but it strikes me as being very peculiar that, while the Minister states that the cost is to be borne 100 per cent. by the State, there is no reference in the Bill to that. In all fair play, it should be definitely mentioned in the Bill and, if necessary, a new section should be introduced definitely stating that the cost of this measure is to be borne entirely by the State. [2410] I do not think it would be wise that this measure should remain in force in perpetuity. It may be that the Minister has the idea of renewing it annually for a period, but as far as local bodies are concerned, I do not think it would be wise from their point of view that it should be renewed perpetually. I would not suggest that the present Minister for Local Government will do anything that could be described as sharp practice in the matter, but some Minister in the future could come along and say that the local bodies would have to bear all the cost. There is very little that can be said that has not been said already. I trust that when the Minister is replying he will elucidate the points that have been put up. I have listened to some of the speeches from this side and I admit that they were slightly exaggerated but, on the other hand, the Minister should meet us and, if he does, he will find a good spirit of co-operation. He need not fear otherwise. He will find a spirit of co-operation on this side. When we criticise, it is because we want to see that matters are right. There is no use in having an Act passed and then finding that it is creating any amount of trouble. I trust the Minister will meet us as we hope to meet him.",06/04/1949,13,129,130,and more necessary because the rivers have become more and more choked up and at the moment there is as,Deputy Coburn,says a great need for the relief of unemployment So far as I personally am concerned I have no inclination,Deputy Coburn,676519_1,,and more necessary because the rivers have become more and more choked up and at the moment there is as Deputy Coburn says a great need for the relief of unemployment So far as I personally am concerned I have no inclination,and more necessary because the rivers have become more and more choked up and at the moment there is as says a great need for the relief of unemployment So far as I personally am concerned I have no inclination,text849,2,2,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.442718872,-0.011067972,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.027027027,0.053053053,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iticised me for not releasing tenders for cottages in west Cork. I could not in conscience approve of tenders well in excess of £3,000 for rural cottages in west Cork when cottages of similar standard are being provided for Kerry County Council,only 20 miles distant,for less than £2,000 apiece or in some cases under £1,900. The facts about local authority housing are,of course,quite different from what the Opposition Deputies have been representing. The total number of local authority dwellings completed in the year ending 31st March last was 4,613,including 1,041 dwellings at Ballymun in the special NBA project,80 in Cork and 86 in Limerick. There were 317 dwellings provided by Dublin Corporation for tenant purchase. The total number of local authority houses provided in the [213] two previous years were 4,045 in 1967-68 and 4,079 in 1966-67. Therefore it is quite obvious there is not a slowing down in the provision of local authority dwellings. In addition,at 31st March,1969,work was in progress on 5,839 dwellings,of which 1,,024 were being provided by the NBA in their special projects. The number of houses at tender stage was 4,351 and the number at planning stage was 7,789. In addition,sites were available to local authorities for a further 18,336 houses and 12,689 sites were being acquired. Therefore,in addition to the fact that the provision of local authority housing has been increasing,we have a substantial programme on hands both in houses at tender stage and houses at planning stage. Also,sites have been made available. It is quite clear that unlike the position handed over on two occasions to incoming Fianna Fáil Governments by Coalition Governments,this time an incoming Fianna Fáil Government are taking over from an outgoing Fianna Fáil Government a substantial and adequate programme of housing by local authorities. During the year 1968-69,approval was given for the acceptance of tenders by local authorities and for direct labour work to the value of £9,199,517,covering the erection of 3,769 new dwellings and site development work costing £360,870. The average number of persons employed on local authority house construction in that year was 4,477,the figure ranging from 4,864 in May to 5,308 in October,1968,including those engaged in NBA projects in Cork,Limerick and Dublin. It will be seen therefore that Opposition allegations of neglect of local authority housing are completely unjustifiable. The position in the current financial year is that the total number of local authority houses completed in the nine months to 31st December last is 3,572 houses including dwellings completed by the NBA in their projects at Ballymun,Cork and Limerick. In addition,there were 189 mobile,demountable,prefabricated dwellings. At the same date,the total number in progress was 6,727,including 2,027 by the NBA and 105 emergency houses. [214] The number at tender was 3,855,including 594 in the Cork project. The number at planning stage at the end of that period was 17,38,and in addition the local authorities had sites available for 22,802 dwellings and were in the process of acquiring sites for a further 11,855. Thus,all the evidence is available for Deputies to see clearly that allegations of a slowing down in local authority house building are without foundation. To conclude on this point,I want to refer to the capital expenditure involved in local authority housing. It has risen steadily in the past seven years,the provision this year being more than three-and-a-half times the amount in 1963-64. The figures since that year are as follows,and I speak in million of pounds: 1963-64,4. 6 1964-65,6. 8 1965-66,9. 87 1966-67,11. 942 1967-68,14. 25 1968-69,15. 75 1969-70,17. 35. That does not show a decrease in the provision for local authority housing nor does it show a decreasing proportion of the total capital expenditure for housing devoted to local authority housing programmes,as both Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy FitzGerald maintained. To illustrate this,I shall give the total public expenditure on housing during the period,again in millions of pounds. In 1963-64,it was 12. 88 1964-65,15. 95 1965-66,20. 96 1966-67,22. 11 1967-68,25. 74 1968-69,29. 72 1969-70,approximately 34 to 35. Deputies will note that in 1963-64 the proportion of expenditure on local authority housing to the total public capital expenditure on housing was slightly more than one-third and that in this year it will be slightly more than one half. That shows there is no foundation for the allegations made by Deputies Fitzpatrick and FitzGerald that there is a decreasing proportion of public capital expenditure on housing being provided for local authority housing. The allocation of capital money for the financial year 1970-71 has not yet been finalised,as Deputies know,but I can assure Deputies Fitzpatrick and FitzGerald and others opposite that the allocation will show a further substantial increase and will effectively [215] refute Deputy FitzGerald's stupid and false allegation that there is a cut-down in capital for housing. I have given those figures for capital expenditure on housing because I find the availability of capital to be a very relevant thing in connection with the carrying out of the housing activities of my Department. The Opposition approach to the whole question of housing finances is as usual simple but insincere,as is their approach to every problem. That approach is designed to be popular to all sections of the community. It is that rates,rents and taxes are all too high,that they should all be reduced,and that more houses should be provided. I cannot think of any more popular policy than that. It is no wonder that Deputy FitzGerald is tearing his hair in frustration it is no wonder the Labour Party complain about the rejection of this policy of theirs by the people it is no wonder that Deputy Ryan came back after the last general election and talked about the stupidity and the ignorance of the people who continually refused to snap at this gaudy bait of lower rents,rates and taxes and higher social welfare benefits,improved health services and accelerated expansion of educational facilities. I am getting tired of telling them it is wrong to assume that the people are fools and that it is unwise to continue to endeavour to be all things to all men. However,in the confident knowledge that they are incapable of treating the electorate as intelligent,I would point out that,while it may be all right for an entertainment medium such as television to adopt the attitude that all protests are 100 per cent right,even when they are directly contrary to one another,the electorate will see through a political Party which pursues this type of dishonest approach and will continue to reject them as they rejected them no later than Wednesday. I should like to say a few words on this complaint of Deputy FitzGerald,in particular,that the Government are forcing people to buy their own houses that we are concentrating on grant-aided houses,at the [216] expense of local authority houses,in order to fake our housing production. The fact of the matter,of course,is that grant-aided houses,if they are financed by SDA loans,are more expensive: they absorb more capital per house. Therefore,if we wanted to produce the maximum number of houses from the available capital,we would produce them in the other way. In any case,I should like to know what is the objection to people,because of the higher living standards that prevail now,owning their own houses or aspiring to own their own houses. We have not forced people to buy houses. We help them in so far as is possible. The Deputy also objected to the sale of land by the local authorities for the provision of private houses although his colleague,Deputy Clinton,shortly after that,objected to the fact that the local authority had ever acquired this land and suggested that they should have left it there for private enterprise to acquire and build houses on it. The Government's policy is to encourage and assist every person who can do so to provide his own dwelling and to cater for families who cannot afford to do so by public housing. Fine Gael should make up their minds what their policy on the matter is. Deputy FitzGerald says that the country which is 40 per cent better off than we were 20 years ago builds less public housing than it did then. It is because of the fact that the country,and therefore the people,is 40 per cent better off,that the people are now 40 per cent better able to provide themselves with housing and that they are inclined to do this. Approximately 58 per cent of all persons using loan facilities provided by local authorities to people buying their own houses had incomes of £1,050 or less per annum in the quarter ended 31st December,1969. These are the sorts of people who,if their future was a little less secure than it is under a Fianna Fáil Government or if they doubted their intention of staying in the country,might apply to a local authority for a rented dwelling. Instead of that,they are willing—and because of the prosperity of recent years,they are able—to gather together [217] a deposit and put it down for a house and undertake the substantial commitment of buying a house by way of a loan. Building societies find that their statistics show a somewhat similar trend. Over one-fifth of all borrowers from building societies have incomes of less than £1,200 a year. These,again,are people who,if they felt a little less secure,as naturally they would under a Coalition Government,might decide to opt for local authority housing instead. Deputy FitzGerald apparently objects to the fact that these people are now prepared to indicate their confidence in the future of the country by undertaking the provision of their own housing. I just do not agree that this in an undesirable trend. It is an indication of the change that has come about in the country as a whole. I should like to refer to this question of comparisons with European countries. Deputies opposite love to get hold of tables giving comparisons with different European countries,and to interpret them without any reference to relevant considerations,in order to appear to substantiate their own favourite thesis that this is 'the most distressful country that ever yet was seen.' Unless these statistics are complemented by background information,they are worse than useless they are completely misleading. As Deputy FitzGerald should know—he has shown in his contribution to the debate—the number of houses needed in a particular country is dependent partly on the number of persons in that country who are married. As will be seen from an Appendix to the White Paper from which he quoted,the number of married persons in this country,as a percentage of the total population,was 33. 5 per cent in 1966 and this is the lowest percentage of any of the countries for which statistics are given. The country with the next lowest percentage of married persons is Switzerland with 44. 8 per cent of the population there married in 1960. Every other country mentioned has a higher proportion of persons married. This,of course,accounts for a sizeable part of the difference in the rate of building per 1,000 of the population. [218] Another reason why houses are built is that the population increases and an increased population requires more accommodation. Here again—in this matter of rate of increase in population—this country has been at the bottom of the list though the position may be starting to change now. A fact that is always completely ignored by Deputies opposite is that the houses that are built here are among the biggest in Europe. The average useful floor space of a house in this country in 1968 is given in the ECE Annual Bulletin for Housing and Building Statistics for Europe as 85. 9 square metres and this is the highest of any country for which statistics are available,apart from Iceland. It is all very well to build perhaps 100,000 houses if each house has only two rooms. You cannot compare this 100,000 houses with,say,20,000 houses that have six rooms each but that is exactly what Deputies opposite are doing in making this type of comparison. The contribution made to the housing drive and to the housing stock by the scheme of reconstruction grants which has been in operation here,more or less in their present form,since 1933 —longer than in any country in Europe —is also ignored by Deputies opposite. Under this scheme,houses are being improved by the addition of extra rooms,or by works to repair structural defects,at the rate of 10,000 a year,so that,in addition to the actual output of new houses,existing accommodation is being made more suitable for the persons who are living in it at quite a rapid rate. Existing houses are being conserved by means of this work. This sort of change has been going on for a long time. Therefore,to get a true picture of the figures,the results of reconstruction grant work must also be included in the reckoning. Deputies will see,if they look at the White Paper appendix which I have mentioned,that the average number of persons per room in the different countries in Europe is also given and with .9 persons per room on average in this country we compare quite favourably with other countries in Europe which have a higher standard of living [219] and a greater wealth per head of population than we have. I admit we are not as good as the best,but this is probably a little bit higher than we can aim for just at the present. As I have said,the Opposition are always very diligent in their search for international statistics which,without reference to the different basis on which they were compiled,can be manipulated so as to support their habitual portrayal of this country as a place of object misery. When we bear in mind the fact that the basic wages in the building industry in this country are certainly as high as they are in England,the average rents of local authority houses provide a fair measure of the level of assistance given from public funds to the housing of local authority tenants. I have comparative figures here. As the existence and significance of these comparative figures seems to have escaped the Opposition researchers I would like to supply the deficiency in the material available to them in order to make an objective comparison of conditions instead of the comparison made by the Opposition with its usual,traditional and deliberate anti-Irish bias. The figures I have here for the average weekly rents of local authority dwellings in England and Wales are from a publication called Housing Statistics No. 15,issued in November,1969,by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office. The average weekly rent of local authority dwellings in the Greater London area in April,1961,28s 1d,and in April,1969,was 53s 9d. If Deputies look at Housing in the Seventies,Table 11,on page 20,gives the average weekly rents of local authority dwellings in this country. In 1961 the average weekly rent of dwellings owned by county borough corporations,was 12s 2d as compared with 28s 1d in the Greater London area in 1969 the average weekly rent in county borough corporation areas in this country was 20s 2d— that figure is not actually in the table because it has become available since it was published—and that figure of 20s 2d in the city areas here compares [220] with 53s 9d in the Greater London area. That figure of 53s 9d is 266 per cent more than the Irish rent and the rent increase since 1961 in the Greater London area has been 91 per cent whilst in this country the increase from 12s 2d to 20s 2d is an increase of 66 per cent. These figures are figures of international comparison also and they certainly give factual proof of the exceedingly low average cost to the tenant of local authority housing in this country as compared with the cost to the tenant of similar accommodation under a socialist regime in England. We see the vastly greater recognition given here,in a country with a substantially lower income per capita,to the principle of subsidising local authority tenants both from the Exchequer and the rates. I think the comparison shows how ill-founded the campaign against the renting system operated by local authorities in this country is because the rent contains a very much greater element of subsidisation than is the case in socialist England. I shall go on to deal with the question of the rents of local authority houses and in particular the differential renting scheme which is operated by a number of local authorities and which obviously,from the point of view of social justice,should be in universal operation. The first thing I would like to deal with is what is described as the B scale differential rent scheme operated by Dublin Corporation. The tendency is to portray this as a terrible draconian measure and to pretend that it applies not only in Dublin but in the country as a whole. Of course,it does not. The B scale renting scheme applies only in Dublin. It is a scheme drawn up by the Dublin Corporation and submitted to me with the approval of the then Dublin City Council,whose proposals were amended substantially in favour of the tenants by me. The first point I want to make with regard to the rent of local authority houses,apart from the point I have already made about the vastly greater subsidisation to local authority houses in this country as compared with socialist England,is that the initiation of these schemes and the detailed administration [221] of individual differential rent schemes is a matter for the local authority providing the houses. They are sanctioned,or approved,by me as Minister for Local Government initially and certain guidelines are laid down by the Minister as guidelines to local authorities making the schemes. These suggest that rents should range from a nominal figure of say 2s 6d a week up to the cost of providing and maintaining a house and within this range rents are based on one-sixth or one-seventh of the income,after certain deductions have been made from that income. In Dublin the B scale rent for a new letting of an ordinary local authority house or a four-roomed flat provided since the 1st January,1954,ranges from 6s 6d a week to 85s a week. These rents include sums for rates up to the level the rates had reached in 1964-65. If the rates are excluded the actual figures for rent ranges obviously from a negative sum,since the minimum of 6s 6d would be insufficient to cover the rates up to the level reached in 1964-65,to about 73s a week on average. Now the rent based on the average cost to the corporation of providing,maintaining and administering a house now is equivalent to approximately £6 a week and the cost of a flat is substantially higher. For example the cost of a four-roomed flat in Keogh Square,Inchicore,is equivalent to a rent of more than £10 a week and these figures do not include any sum for rates. The fact that the maximum figure for the rent is,on average,73s under this B scale,whereas the average cost would be £6 a week,is an indication of the high level of subsidisation by taxpayers and ratepayers many of whom are not as well housed themselves and not as well able to pay as those whom they are subsidising,particularly those who would be paying anything approaching the maximum rent. I would say that anyone who has any sympathy with the present agitation should reserve that sympathy not for those who are liable for the maximum rent but for those in between,because I would certainly agree that those people whose incomes do not justify the maximum rent in accordance with [222] this scheme are very hard-pressed and their outgoings must leave them with a Spartan standard of living to say the least of it. The peculiar thing about the agitation that is going on is that it is about the maximum rent and not about the people who are not paying the maximum rent. It is aimed,as has been admitted in an article in the Irish Independent,at benefiting the least deserving section of the tenants rather than the most deserving. Even if a person is on the maximum of this B scale rent he is not paying what similar accommodation is now costing or what he would have to pay for a privately rented flat. A man with a wife and four children would,in fact,need to have an income of £28 10s a week before he would pay the maximum of the B scale rent. With £18 a week he would have to pay only £2 10s a week plus the post-1964-65 rates which would average out at about 11s. If a man's income falls because of unemployment,strikes,illness or retirement,his rent falls also so,in effect,the scheme is a form of insurance for those whose income is liable to fluctuate. It is worth comparing the figure of £2 10s a week plus the post-1964-65 rates increase which a man on £18 a week would have to pay,not only with the cost of providing accommodation now,but also with what he would have to pay if he were to buy a house with the aid of a small dwellings loan from the local authority. This is not just an academic comparison. It is a real comparison because the statistics published by my Department show that about 58 per cent of all persons raising housing loans from the local authority have incomes of £1,050 a year,which is £20 a week approximately. A great number of them have smaller incomes. Assuming that the borrower puts down a deposit of £800 and borrows the average amount of a loan in Dublin of £2,850,his outgoing on the house,after taking into account State and local authority grants,will be over £5 a week plus ground rent,insurance and the cost of maintenance and,in addition to that,he will have to pay one-tenth of the rates in the first year,two-tenths in the second year,and so [223] on. That compares with the fact that a man with £18 a week has to pay only £2 10s a week for his dwelling under this B scale rent system in Dublin,plus,as I said,about 11s a week for rates. The contention that there is something particularly draconian in the B scale rents,as such,is completely wrong. The major difference is that the maximum rent of 73s is more in line with current costs and current incomes. Apart from this the scheme is,in fact,more favourable to the tenant. In particular,the allowances under the B scale rent system for persons with low incomes or with many children are more generous than those under other corporation differential rent schemes. As is obvious,it is not with people with low incomes or with large families that the agitation is concerned but mainly with people who should be in a position to undertake their own housing. Many hundreds of persons have in fact opted of their own accord to go on to the B scale rent since it was introduced some years ago and have got reductions in their rents of up to 19s a week by going on to the B scale rent system. It is probable that many more would have done this but for the fact that they were scared off from taking this very sensible step by the activities of those who are fostering this agitation including,I may say,the two evening papers circulating in this city. The effect of the new rent scheme is concealed from the bulk of the tenants whom it is hoped to dupe into acting as pawns for those who should not be in local authority houses at all. The cost of keeping rents of corporation housing so low in comparison with what it is in socialist England is met by the State from general taxation,and by the local authority from rates. In 1964-65,in Dublin city this amounted to £1,577,000. In the current financial year it is estimated at £3,500,000. This is for the Dublin Corporation area alone. Next year it will be higher again. There is an obvious need for a differential rent scheme which allows persons to get decent housing at a rent far below the [224] cost. Without this sort of system many persons who are now in good housing simply could not have got it,and many persons on the local authority waiting list could never get it. There is need for subsidies to maintain the system. Subsidies have to be provided by the ratepayers and by the taxpayers many of whom,as I have pointed out,are less well housed than the people they are subsidising and less well able to provide the money. My concern is that these subsidies,which I agree are necessary and justifiable,should not go to persons who do not need them,and that they should not absorb money which should be used to build decent homes for the many thousands of people who are still without them. The £3,500,000 to be spent on subsidising Dublin Corporation housing in 1969-70 could build another 1,200 houses if it were available for that purpose. The £14. 9 million paid in subsidies for Dublin Corporation housing alone since 1964-65 would have built another 6,000 houses. I have no hesitation in saying that it is unjust to subsidise people who do not need it at the expense of people living in deplorable conditions. This,in fact,is what is being demanded. I am confident that the many thousands of persons now living in the comparatively good accommodation provided for them by the local authority would not willingly be a party in this way to a slowing down of the drive to house those who have still not got decent housing including in many cases their own sons and daughters who may be living with them or in other overcrowded or insanitary conditions and waiting for a house. I recognise that many persons in corporation houses who pay rents which vary with income would wish to buy their own houses and so convert their varying payments into a fixed sum each week or month for purchase. I understand that the corporation are pressing ahead with their scheme to give tenants an opportunity to buy and that over 8,000 tenants have,in fact,expressed an interest in purchase. I have also asked the corporation to take [225] steps to try to reduce the number of persons who fall into serious arrears with their rent through no fault of their own. I am confident that the local authority are taking steps to this end. I understand that they are at present communicating with the tenants on the subject. I agree that there has been,as far as my experience goes,a certain inflexibility in regard to the actual administration of this scheme and that there have been some anomalies in it. I am satisfied that the local authority is doing everything possible to eliminate these,and that is the only fault I will admit in the scheme. The scheme itself as sanctioned by me is thoroughly justifiable and defensible on any grounds whatsoever. The maximum rents charged are not excessive and are based on a reasonable proportion of the tenant's income after certain deductions are made. The case was made that overtime earnings should not be taken into account. Anyone who examines that contention will see that it has no justifiable basis. It may be that there is a case for taking these overtime earnings into account in a different way and that possibly some proportion of them should be omitted because of the contention that there is extra expense associated with overtime earnings. I would certainly be prepared to consider any proposals of that kind that may be submitted to me by any local authority,but I do not agree that there is any justification for asking that overtime earnings as such should be ignored. It is a great pity that articles should appear in national newspapers containing deliberate falsehoods obviously designed to foster opposition to a system of rents which enables housing to be made available irrespective of capacity to pay. These have appeared in at least two of the national dailies and constitute,in my opinion,a cynical and deliberate attempt to perpetrate a confidence trick on local authority tenants by pretending to be on the side of the less-well-off when in reality the campaign is,beyond any shadow of doubt,a campaign by the haves against the have-nots. If people who can afford to pay reasonable rents [226] for the accommodation provided for them do not pay it,then the capacity to provide adequate housing for people who cannot afford to pay for it will be reduced. There was one article which appeared in the Irish Times shortly before the recent by-election and was obviously published with a view to affecting the result of that by-election but which did not have that effect and which contained the most deliberate and exaggerated misstatements of fact. That newspaper demonstrated its adherence to the principle of fair play and free speech by refusing to publish a contradiction giving the facts. For instance,it was stated in the article that these rents were based on one-third of the income whereas,in fact,they are based on one-sixth after deductions have been made. The article states: According to their differential rents scheme they will have to pay as high as £5 13s a week when Tommy is working. The rent is estimated as roughly one-third of his wages and this is assessed every three months. Then 3s 6d is charged on every £1 earned over the stated amount,which does not encourage working overtime or honest declaration of 'nixers',and this extra bill sometimes amounting to £30 or £40 can arrive out of the blue causing further chaos in the budget. That is the type of falsehood circulated in so-called responsible newspapers which brings about this type of unjustified agitation now taking place. The maximum rent,this article in the Irish Times states,is £5 13s per week. It is not. I gave the maximum rent,which includes a figure for rates up to the level they reached in 1964-65. If there was such a maximum rent,which of course there is not,the tenant would have to have an income of £37 18s per week excluding children's allowances which in the case of the family described would be approximately £2 10 per week. There were a number of other misstatements in the article in respect of which the newspaper refused to publish a contradiction,which is a typical attitude of the paper concerned. It is [227] a pity that this type of deliberate misrepresentation should go on in regard to such a vital matter as housing and thereby help to bring about an agitation which is designed to interfere with the provision of houses for those who are still in need. At other times both of these national daily newspapers complain about the level of rates and also,at the appropriate time,they complain about the level of taxation. I have shown the substantially higher subsidisation of local authority houses here by means of rates and taxes than in socialist England,and this therefore is a demand for a still higher degree of subsidisation. It is a demand for the higher level of subsidisation not and specifically not for those who are most in need but for the better-off section of corporation tenants. It is clear that if this campaign is to succeed,first of all,the higher the subsidisation of existing houses the less the capacity to build new houses for those who are still in need of them. Secondly,it must surely be admitted that many ratepayers are less well able to pay their present rates and other outgoings on their housing accommodation than the people on whose behalf this campaign is being conducted by the media,which,as I say,complain so bitterly about rates and are also conducting this completely contradictory campaign. The case was made more extensively in the Irish Independent of 5th March. We can see from that case that not alone is this campaign aimed against those still seeking houses and against the ratepayers but it is not even for the benefit of the most deserving and the most numerous section of the tenants. It is obviously an effort to trick the great bulk of the tenants into allowing themselves to be used as pawns. For as many years as I can remember there have been widespread complaints about the high total income alleged to be going into some houses provided by Dublin Corporation compared with the incomes of people undertaking the task of providing their own houses. Yet,it is specifically stated here that one of the main objects of this campaign is to [228] ensure that no account whatever is taken of any income except that of the tenant himself. This means that the tenant with four adult children,earning possibly substantial incomes," is to pay only the same rent and receive the same subsidy from ratepayers and taxpayers whose circumstances may in many cases""""",11/03/1970,19,2175,2176,saying that it was written for children he meant children who could read national school 203 children As far as,Deputy FitzGerald,is concerned obviously we aimed too high and we should have made it intelligible at kindergarten level He has missed,Deputy FitzGerald,1412600_11,saying that it was written for children he meant children who could read national school 203 children As far as Deputy FitzGerald is concerned obviously we aimed too high and we should have made it intelligible at kindergarten level He has missed,saying that it was written for children he meant children who could read national school 203 children As far as is concerned obviously we aimed too high and we should have made it intelligible at kindergarten level He has missed,text594,2,1,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-0.510825624,-0.012770641,-0.376301161,-0.009407529,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.186186186,0.199199199,0.038038038,0.067067067,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Burke,Fianna Fáil,Dublin County,"First, I wish to refer to a few points made by the last speaker. Deputy Corish wants to know why money was not available for housing immediately Fianna Fáil took office. He compared the work done by Fianna Fáil with the work done by the inter-Party Government in 1948. When the inter-Party Government took office in 1948, having defeated Fianna Fáil at the hustings by misrepresentation, Deputy Seán Lemass, as he then was, as Deputy Leader of the Party, said to that Government that Fianna Fáil had given over the country to them in a sound financial position and that they should give it back to Fianna Fáil in the same condition. The inter-Party Government had a very nice jumping-off ground in 1948. The country was in a sound financial position. There was a number of schemes already under way and everything was in their favour. Deputy Corish also wants to know what Fianna Fáil did for the workers and farmers. We did everything possible for the workers. We gave protection to industry to encourage people to invest money in industrial projects.",19/03/1958,16,85,86,by misrepresentation Deputy Seán Lemass as he then was as Deputy Leader of the Party said to that Government that,Fianna Fáil,had given over the country to them in a sound financial position and that they should give it back to,Fianna Fáil,966811_6,,by misrepresentation Deputy Seán Lemass as he then was as Deputy Leader of the Party said to that Government that Fianna Fáil had given over the country to them in a sound financial position and that they should give it back to,by misrepresentation Deputy Seán Lemass as he then was as Deputy Leader of the Party said to that Government that had given over the country to them in a sound financial position and that they should give it back to,text710,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.156173762,-0.003904344,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.161161161,0.187187187,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2242685,844,14,93,Confidence in Government: Motion.,20/02/1986,Dr. John F. O'Connell (Deceased),The Labour Party,Dublin South-West,"The Government Ministers who have spoken have been rather disconcerted that there should be a motion of no confidence. That is the prerogative of the Opposition where they feel it is justified. I recall on 3 November 1982 Deputy FitzGerald, as Leader of the Opposition, put down a motion of no confidence. He said his justification for doing so was that a situation had developed over the previous seven months which made it timely for the Opposition [3392] to put down a motion of no confidence. He spoke about the record of internal disunity and division, indecision in critical policies and putting forward an economic plan which from the first moment it appeared was discredited by independent comment from every angle. That was his justification and it was his prerogative. The events of last week justify a motion of no confidence. No amount of whitewashing can disguise the fact that there was mishandling of Cabinet decisions. The Taoiseach's authority was flouted by one of his Ministers. The Taoiseach was not truthful in saying that he had accepted the resignation of the junior Ministers in question. This morning the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, made it clear to the Taoiseach that only a Government could appoint junior Ministers and he asked the Taoiseach whether a Government meeting had been held last Thursday. The Taoiseach was very quick to point out that there was a Government meeting last Thursday. The announcement was made at 4. 50 p. m. Did a Government meeting take place before the Taoiseach's announcement? This is crucial. If a Government meeting did not take place, then the Taoiseach has misled the House again and the Taoiseach has no other course but to resign. It is incumbent on the Taoiseach to clarify this matter and to tell us exactly what time the Government meeting took place at which the decision was made to appoint the two Ministers concerned. The Taoiseach has the authority under Article 28 of the Constitution to call for the resignation of a Minister. If a Minister refuses to resign the Taoiseach can bring the matter to the attention of the President and the President can terminate the Minister's appointment. Here was a blatant challenge to the Taoiseach's authority — Deputy Desmond's refusal to resign. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that this Minister refused to resign. I will not go into detail as to why the Taoiseach should want to transfer him from his very sensitive post. We had a challenge to the authority of the Taoiseach. [3393] By virtue of the fact that he has not the support of his Ministers, the Taoiseach is honour bound to resign. I always had the greatest admiration for Deputy FitzGerald from the time he came into this House. I thought we were seeing not a politician, as we had known them, but a statesman in the making. I was very happy to see him take over the reins of Government in 1981. I thought he would lead a crusade for better government and a better country. I thought he was a very honourable man. At the time I would have followed him in what he wanted to do for this country. I cannot say I hold a high opinion of him now. Some actions of his, some decisions he has taken, lead me to question this. I would not be exaggerating if I said that I think he is just playing party politics. He could not, by my reckoning, be described as a statesman. He has succumbed to the lure of power and by his decision to sacrifice his principles for political expediency he has been shamed he has destroyed the image he has destroyed the good name he had and he has shaken the confidence of his close friends. He has shaken the confidence of those in the media who stood by him loyally through the years. We all agree that the media were very benevolent towards the Taoiseach in the three and a half years he has been in office because they were be bazzled by him. I can well understand why they wanted to see a statesman in office, a man who proclaimed he was on a crusade. One of his greatest supporters, down the years, one of those who has been most loyal to him, his unpaid public relations man, Bruce Arnold of the Irish Independent, a very honourable person whom I have known since 1973, has changed his opinion. Bruce Arnold has stood by the Taoiseach week in and week out. He has defended him at times when the Taoiseach needed defending. That columnist remained constantly loyal to the Taoiseach but this morning in the Irish Independent Bruce Arnold conveyed in an article that his confidence had been shaken. He indicated that he felt he had been betrayed by the Taoiseach. It took [3394] tremendous courage to write that type of article but Bruce Arnold is a courageous and honourable man. I have defended that columnist over the years when party political people described him as an enemy. My response was that he was an honourable man. He has now made a statement about the Taoiseach.",20/02/1986,24,734,734,one of those who has been most loyal to him his unpaid public relations man Bruce Arnold of the Irish,Independent,a very honourable person whom I have known since 1973 has changed his opinion Bruce Arnold has stood by the,Independent,2242685_4,,one of those who has been most loyal to him his unpaid public relations man Bruce Arnold of the Irish Independent a very honourable person whom I have known since 1973 has changed his opinion Bruce Arnold has stood by the,one of those who has been most loyal to him his unpaid public relations man Bruce Arnold of the Irish a very honourable person whom I have known since 1973 has changed his opinion Bruce Arnold has stood by the,text914,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.057646135,0.001441153,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.507507508,0.493493493,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2917161,762,9,91,Report of Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments) and Establishment of Tribunal of Inquiry: Motions (Resumed).,11/09/1997,Mr. Gay Mitchell,Fine Gael,Dublin South-Central,"I have been a past critic of the administration of the courts in particular and the legal profession and my criticisms were levelled with sincerity. It was something that needed to be said and I hope those involved in the administration of the courts take on board those criticisms. However, the work done by Mr. Justice Finlay and in this case by Mr. Justice McCracken has gone a long way towards restoring my confidence in the ability of the Judiciary to make itself relevant and to deal with important issues. Mr. Justice McCracken has done a great job. I hope other members of the legal profession, judges and those involved in the administration of the courts will follow his example and use their skills in an innovative way to restore the confidence in that wing of Government which we in another way must restore in this wing of Government. Deputy McDowell and others said the standards people see is what they expect from politicians. The majority of people knew that Charles Haughey was not funding himself from his salary from this House and, to a large extent, the public shares in that dishonesty. It is time we as representatives of the public were able to speak openly and honestly. I apologise if what I have to say causes embarrassment, but it is likely the majority of farmers who receive cash payments would do the same as Mr. Haughey or Deputy Lowry. The majority of grocers and, dare I say barristers, when they received cash payments before making returns for VAT, would also do likewise. What does that say about those barristers who later became judges? Let us stop the hypocrisy. Those people did not expect any more from politicians because that is how they lived their lives. We should admit that the majority of the Members of the House and of the public were well aware that Charles Haughey was not funding himself from his political income. The country is partly to blame for this scandal. Deputy Hanafin made an eloquent speech. Fianna Fáil has a particular problem which I will try to address as impartially as an Opposition Deputy prosecuting the Government can, in the hope that we can restore some of Fianna Fáil's greatness not merely for its sake but for the sake of the Opposition because we pace ourselves off each other. Fianna Fáil must face up to its problem. It is pointless saying we are all the same. A particular problem has been identified and it must be exorcised and dealt with by Members on all sides of the House. Many Members on this side of the House as well as members of the public are sneaking regarders of Charles Haughey. [799] We must admit our capacity for dishonesty. There is a range of issues with which we are not willing to deal. We dare not discuss NATO or hold a rational debate on abortion. We dishonestly shove such matters to one side. While the majority of people knew Charles Haughey was doing this, very few questions were asked when he was returned as Taoiseach on three occasions. Consequently the public shares part of the responsibility. There is a general perception that politicians today should not be trusted. We should read what Shakespeare, Swift and other noted people said about politicians down through the years. In recent times our former party leader, Dr. FitzGerald has been writing about what happened at the time of the foundation of the State and how things have moved on since then. How did the de Valera family become owners of the Irish Press and a particular Fine Gael family become owners of the Irish Sweepstake? Let us not think these are new issues, there have always been scandals in politics. If we are putting everything on the table let us speak honestly and openly. What happens in this House is that we reflect, in many ways, the standards people expect, because those are the standards they expect of themselves. We should consider what Deputy Ardagh said about dishonesty. Recently, for the first time in over a decade, I took up a business interest outside this House, which I will declare in the normal course of events. I did it for a number of reasons, not only for the money but because I need to do something outside politics. I hope I can bring what I have experienced in politics to business and what I learn in business back to politics. However, I find that in business as in the public service relatively junior people are paid vastly more than Members of this House who are in insecure employment. In any other profession or walk of life people in insecure employment are paid more because they have short-term contracts or an uncertain future. We have allowed ourselves to be painted as doing something out of the ordinary if we even apply what an independent commission has decided should be our rate of pay. I share a constituency with Deputy Briscoe, who has been over 30 years in the House. I have been here for 17 years. Deputy Briscoe has never been a Minister, he is a hard-working Deputy and I find him a good colleague with whom to work. Should he not receive service pay for all the years' work he has given to this House? We should stop denigrating ourselves. We should stand up for ourselves, remunerate ourselves properly in a reasoned and fair way and stop apologising for that, because as long as we do, we will have to rely on outside people to fund our campaigns. Does anyone think I could fund my electoral campaign from what I am paid for serving in this House? Six people, my wife, my four children and myself, all live off my Dáil salary. I do not say it is the worst salary available but what [800] is left after paying PAYE is not enough to fund a campaign. All of this must be regulated and due consideration must be given to this in the way we do our business. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bruton, said: Recent reports are full of examples of a structure of decision making here that has deliberately allowed decisions to be taken by Ministers or officials on the basis of executive discretion rather than on the basis of unambiguous laws that are available to all and applied openly by the courts.. Once the laws allow discretionary decisions to be taken without clear rules, we create an environment for corruption.. Serious questions were treated with derision. Mr. Haughey always seemed to have a willing band around him ready to crease their faces with derisory laughter when he treated with contempt serious questions on this matter from the press. Some of those faces are still visible on the Front Bench opposite. Do some of those in Fianna Fáil feel even mildly embarrassed that they were among those who laughed or gave moral support to their leader when these questions about his wealth were imperiously dismissed at press conferences and on public platforms? While the issue was of public importance, it was, or should have been, a matter of serious concern to Fianna Fáil during those years, but the party was blind. One matter in particular is of serious concern and I will place it on the record because I want to draw it to the attention of the House and the tribunal. Deputy Bruton also said yesterday: The sale of Carysfort College to UCD must now be re-examined in far greater detail and with far greater rigour.. Exactly the same pattern of collective Government decision making is to be found in the Carysfort case as was disclosed in the beef tribunal. Ministers worked alone, without civil servants to ensure accountability. The absence of civil servants from eight meetings with UCD, some of them involving Mr. Haughey, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and others between 11 September 1990 and 12 December 1990 does not, to quote the Committee of Public Accounts, 'suggest the degree of transparency which one would expect to be evident in all financial transactions of the State'. I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts at the time and I received the cooperation of the vast majority of Fianna Fáil Members of the committee, as well as of the other parties present, in bringing forward the report of the committee on the sale of Carysfort. The Comptroller and Auditor General reported to the committee on this matter in his report on the accounts of 1990. We also made a special interim report to the Dáil, signed by me as Chairman on 6 February 1992. Before issuing that report we brought before the committee not only the Accounting Officer of the Department of Education [801] but the Accounting Officers of the Department of Finance and the Valuation Office, the President of UCD and others. The Committee of Public Accounts did a good job on that occasion. As I am familiar with the Carysfort case, I will discuss this example to explain what happened and why it is relevant that it should be investigated as part of the tribunal's considerations. In the period leading up to September 1990, the Department of Education made no offer for Carysfort for instance, it made no offer in October 1989, when a reasonable offer was invited nor in February 1990 when it was clear that the then owners wished to dispose of the property. This is mentioned in the committee's report. The Valuation Office valued the site at approximately £3. 8 million in August 1989. In November 1990, a little over a year later, UCD acquired it for £8 million, without being told during the negotiations of the Valuation Office assessment. This is also mentioned in the report. There is no doubt that UCD acquired an excellent property but at a cost of £9. 7 million to the State. The college originally intended to locate its graduate business school in Roebuck Castle, which would have cost the college £5 million, albeit for a smaller facility, with no cost to the State. The Higher Education Authority, which has authority under sections 3 and 8 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, was not consulted, it was bypassed as was the Department of Education. Both expressed their disquiet about this. The Department of Finance opposed this purchase for traditional budgetary reasons. However, because of the Cabinet procedures used it was unable to give its view before the decision was made. I refer here to pages 96 and 98 of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts. The Cabinet procedures allow a Minister, with the prior agreement of the Taoiseach, to raise a matter at Government without circulating a memorandum. That is what happened on 4 December 1990, according to the evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts. I refer here to pages 6 and 98 of the Public Accounts Committee report. There are precedents for this. The Engineering School in Merrion Street was dealt with in the same way. However, a supplementary Estimate was introduced in this House and the Higher Education Authority got the necessary moneys to transfer to UCD on 21 December 1990. The matter was brought to Cabinet without papers on 4 December. An Estimate was rushed through this House. The Higher Education Authority was given the money on 21 December which it had to immediately transfer to UCD. That was done on Christmas Eve 1990. I refer here to pages 52 and 53 of the Public Accounts Committee report. Dr. Patrick Masterson, who was then president of UCD, told the Committee of Public Accounts in evidence that an invitation came from the then Minister for Education to UCD to discuss Carysfort's availability. He did not know it was available [802] to him at that stage. He told the committee on page 58 of the report that the Department made it clear Carysfort was the only option for which UCD would receive State funding. In pages 55 and 59 of the report he makes it clear that the Minister contacted UCD. Incidentally, she told the Dáil that the proposal was from UCD, which I think is referred to on page 148 of the Public Accounts Committee report. Technically, she was right in that the proposal came from UCD, but it came from UCD at her instigation. Therefore, factually and in every other way she was wrong. It may have to be explained in time why it was suggested the proposal came from UCD. The Committee of Public Accounts did not accept that Carysfort represented optimum value for money, especially as the property was sold some months earlier for a significantly lower amount than UCD ultimately paid for it. In pages 9 and 10 of the report the committee strongly criticised the Department of Education because there was a limited market for that property. The report states on page 5 that Carysfort 'was sold to a private developer in June 1990 for a sum reputedly in the range of £6. 25 million to £6. 5 million'. However, six months later UCD used State funds to buy it for £8 million plus £1. 7 million other costs. Page 62 of the Public Accounts Committee report indicated that Dr. Masterson, the president of UCD, expected business people to fund Roebuck in its entirety. However, he was told to forget about the £5 million he was going to raise to fund Roebuck because the State would give him £9. 7 million — but only if he purchased the Carysfort site. He was told he would not be given funding for any other option. This Carysfort site — which was valued at £3. 8 million in August 1989 for which the Department made no attempt to bid prior to September 1990, such as in October 1989 or February 1990 and which was purchased for £6. 25 million or £6. 5 million by a private individual — was suddenly foisted on UCD. The cheque was written before Christmas by the State through Cabinet procedures which did not meet the normal transparent financial requirements of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General or this House, or which would not be accepted as fair and reasonable. Page 4 of the report states the Department of Education building unit set out to justify this purchase as a value for money exercise. It emphasised that it cost £8 million. In fact, the cost to the State was £9. 7 million. It is pointed out in the report, following evidence given by the chief evaluation officer, that St. Helen's, a nearby educational facility with 70 acres, was sold for £7 million in May 1989. Carysfort was valued by the Valuation Office at about £190,000 an acre as against £100,000 per acre for St. Helen's. Although the Valuation Office valued the acreage of Carysfort at almost twice that of St. Helen's, it still said it was only worth £3. 8 million. This is very relevant because pages 25, 63, 64, [803] 66 and 71 of the report make it clear that civil servants were excluded from all five meetings between UCD and the then Minister for Education and all three meetings between UCD and the then Taoiseach. Not only were Cabinet procedures bypassed, the normal procedure whereby at least a proper record of meetings is kept to ensure transparency, was also bypassed at all those meetings. As Deputy Bruton said yesterday, the Committee of Public Accounts stated that did not suggest the degree of transparency which the committee would expect. That was not said by me but by the Committee of Public Accounts, supported in a professional way by the vast majority of Fianna Fáil members of that committee. The Accounting Officer of the Department of Education asserted that the property was never on offer to his Department for less than £8 million. However, the Public Accounts Committee found it hard to reconcile that statement with the fact that the property was sold to a private developer in June 1990 for a sum reputedly in the range of £6. 25 million to £6. 5 million. Although the Department of Finance, which was opposed to the purchase on traditional budgetary grounds, was not consulted in advance on whether the purchase represented value for money or on the need for such facilities at the level envisaged, the State was still committed to this expenditure. At a meeting of the Cabinet on 4 December 1990 it approved the purchase of Carysfort by UCD without having a formal memorandum presented to it. In the course of hearing evidence, the committee was informed that under Cabinet procedures that could only happen if a Minister raised the matter orally, provided that the Minister had the prior agreement of the Taoiseach. The committee said this procedure was followed in regard to Carysfort. On 21 December 1990, the Accounting Officer for the Department of Education told the Higher Education Authority that approval of the Minister for Finance was required for any recurring costs. However, the President of University College Dublin told the committee in evidence that on the same date the Taoiseach gave him an assurance that 'incremental running costs would be an appropriate charge'. UCD was force fed £9. 7 million of taxpayers' funds to buy a facility which the Valuation Office said was worth only £3. 8 million. UCD was contacted by the Minister, told this was available and told to negotiate. However, it was never told that the Valuation Office said it was worth only £3. 8 million. Subsequently, in rushed circumstances and without proper Cabinet and financial control procedures being followed, £9. 7 million was used to secure it. Higher Education Authority, Department of Finance and Cabinet procedures were bypassed. It was the subject of criticism by the one person who could not be bypassed, the Comptroller and Auditor General. He examined the file and brought it to the attention of the [804] Committee of Public Accounts, which strongly criticised it. I have laboured this point because Deputy Hanafin is an honourable, well intentioned and first-class Member of the House. However, she asked what was so different about Fianna Fáil. The answer is that Ministers addressed the Taoiseach as 'Boss'—'Yes Boss, no Boss, three bags full Boss'. These Ministers did so to ensure their survival, to clock up their salaries and pensions and because they were afraid. They allowed that culture to prevail. As Deputy Bruton said yesterday, they bear part of the responsibility. Mr. Haughey and the Ministers who facilitated the procedure will be indicted if it transpires that the person, or any person or company associated with him, who purchased that property and sold it to the State in such a short time for a large profit gave funds to Mr. Haughey. Until the Fianna Fáil Party makes it part of its philosophy that it will not accept such standards in high places, which the late Mr. George Colley criticised, it will stand aside from every other group as the party with the most to answer for. None of us is a saint but it has the most to answer for, not just for having that culture but for introducing it and allowing it to prosper. It is obvious that the approach of addressing Mr. Haughey as 'Boss' and encouraging his mannerisms and use of the facilities of the State as if they were personally available to him was an abdication of constitutional collective Cabinet responsibility. All sides should learn that Ministers share collective responsibility in Cabinet. The Taoiseach is primus inter pares but he is not a dictator. Those who facilitated the procedures which allowed the Carysfort incident to occur share responsibility for it. I draw the attention of the House and the tribunal to this matter. I hope it will be of interest to the tribunal and that it will bear it in mind in conducting its inquiries. I welcome the opportunity to address this matter. I hope the tribunal will in private or in public, or both, inquire from the people who were associated with the Carysfort and other similar deals if they made direct or indirect contributions to Mr. Haughey. This aspect is relevant to the investigative approach of the tribunal.",11/09/1997,28,856,857,constituency with Deputy Briscoe who has been over 30 years in the House I have been here for 17 years,Deputy Briscoe,has never been a Minister he is a hard-working Deputy and I find him a good colleague with whom to,Deputy Briscoe,2917161_9,,constituency with Deputy Briscoe who has been over 30 years in the House I have been here for 17 years Deputy Briscoe has never been a Minister he is a hard-working Deputy and I find him a good colleague with whom to,constituency with Deputy Briscoe who has been over 30 years in the House I have been here for 17 years has never been a Minister he is a hard-working Deputy and I find him a good colleague with whom to,text266,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.280224269,0.007005607,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.857857858,0.800800801,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1264081,318,9,152,Nomination of Members of Government.,11/11/1966,Mr. James M. Dillon,Fine Gael,Monaghan,"I must begin my observations by a word of rebuke for Deputy Dunne. If it were not for a speech made by his Leader in Tullamore, Fianna Fáil would not be the Government of this country today. If the Labour Party were prepared to accept their part of the burden, I was prepared to undertake that that crowd would never have got in. We are paying a bitter price for the decision enunciated at Tullamore. It might have meant more work politically for me, who would have had responsibility to resolve the problems in the event of an inter-Party Government after the last general election, but we would have resolved them, just as surely as we did during two previous administrations, if the Labour Party had been prepared to bear their share of the burden of responsibility. If Bill Norton, the Lord have mercy on him, had still been with us, he would have faced that responsibility with the same valiance as he did in 1948 and in 1954. Now, I want to turn to the express questions which we are called upon here to consider. I ask the House, more especially at this time, to bear it clearly in mind that the fact that Jack Lynch is a man of integrity should not deflect our minds from the real business this House is now considering, that is, the Government he chooses and the policy he proposes to the country. Firstly among that Government is his colleague, Deputy Aiken, the Tánaiste. I want to submit that his continued presence in that position reveals more dramatically than anything else the savage warfare that is pervading the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party, not in the service of Ireland but in the service of personal preferment. Deputy Aiken who has been described [898] by his own ex-Leader, Deputy Seán Lemass, as an historic monument has been made Tánaiste because Deputy Jack Lynch, when he became Taoiseach, did not dare to choose any other colleague lest it might be suggested he had become a Colleyite or a Haugheyite. Now, in this euphoria that is associated with the preference of a relatively young man of integrity, as I have no hesitation in describing Deputy Jack Lynch, we are not to forget what led up to his preferment and to the business he has recommended here to us today. I ask the House to remember the slogans associated with the last general election. The dominant issue was: 'Let Lemass Lead On'. Now, we told the people at that time: 'If you let Lemass lead on, you are going to be led into a bog of insolvency, of unemployment and ultimate economic and political servitude to powers outside Oireachtas Éireann.' I now say that, having reduced us to that position, Lemass has elected to lead nowhere.

I reaffirm that I am completely opposed to corporate contributions from any source, be they in the United States, here at home or in any other jurisdiction. Let us reach that point of agreement at least and then we can look at the deficiency in amendment No. 2 he recommends to me. How can I possibly support an amendment that seeks to limit contributions solely and only to those who are Dáil electors? I live a few miles short of the Border, nearer to it than Deputy Bell and I am sure he has no doubt that the effect of this amendment, if it became a core element of the Bill, would be to exclude a contribution from any of my party colleagues in the North and members of my family and friends who reside in the North. It is an absolute absurdity. The situation is only marginally improved – which I acknowledged to the Minister of State on Committee Stage and do again now – where we are at least looking at Irish citizens, which incorporates the whole island, but the Labour Party amendment seeks to restrict this to those who are registered Dáil electors in this jurisdiction. That is another act of copper-fastening partition and is anathema to me it is in antipathy to everything I stand for and hold dear. I recommend amendment No. 23 and in the true spirit of addressing the issue of corporate donations I have already indicated I will support Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 3.

1743974,338,8,93,"Financial Resolutions, 1976. - Financial Resolution No. 11: General (Resumed).",26/02/1976,Mr. Joe Dowling,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South-West,"I have listened to many of the speeches in this debate and I have been puzzled on hearing them. In the course of his budget speech, the Minister indicated that clarification of the future management of the economy and the measures to be taken would be announced. We wonder what is still to come because so far we have had a budget a day from the Government. We are in a serious situation because the budget is only a part of the overall system we will be debating in the course of 1976. It is obvious that the budget is responsible for many increases in the price of commodities. We heard the Minister in this House predict that as a result of the increase in VAT charges the price of the pint would rise by 1p but it is indicated in the Press this morning that the increase will be 3p. This gives some idea [842] of the inaccuracies in the statements of the Minister for Finance. The Minister could properly be called the political pickpocket of the seventies. He has dug deep into every pocket in the country and, as Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, the housewives and the workers are those who are most seriously affected. However, we have heard no suggestions for an immediate remedy for the tragic situation that faces the country. We have had many utterances from the Minister. Recently, according to a supplied script, the Minister was found talking to himself outside a licensed premises with nobody to listen to him. This is because nobody believes him any more. We must examine the situation and see what steps can be taken in the immediate future. There have been rumblings from the Tánaiste about an economic and social plan. What will this be based on? This is the first time we have heard the suggestion. Is it because they are about to collect their conscience money that they talk about an economic and social plan, because their pensions are safe? This is not good enough. We must consider the unfortunate people who are unemployed. We are told the number will rise to 130,000 in the very near future. I suggest that an immediate examination be carried out in each local authority area regarding labour intensive schemes. Local authorities should be instructed to establish working groups to develop such projects and I will outline some of them during the debate. These schemes would not interfere in any way with the permanent staffs or with projects that are on hands. Co-operation with the Office of Public Works and with the Department of Lands would be worthwhile because the Office of Public Works have machinery that is depreciating in value because of lack of use. There are many schemes that require nothing but a labour content. The pooling of resources in a national emergency of this kind is necessary and desirable [843] and it should be undertaken immediately. During this debate I will give the Minister a few suggestions he might consider. Let us consider the census of population which was shelved by the Government because it would cost £1. 3 million. It was a completely irresponsible action on their part. I suggest that this project would have a high labour content. People who are unemployed at the moment are receiving 85 per cent of their wage packet and if the census were carried out it would cost only an additional 15 per cent. I do not think the Government are serious about an economic and social plan. I think the rumblings from the Tánaiste have come because of the pressure of members of the Labour Party, if they are still members of that party. Immediate action should be taken on the compilation of a census of population. That is both necessary and desirable in order to provide a base or platform from which to work in regard to future programmes and projects. It is imperative that we should have projections for the future and, from that point of view, a census of population is of vital importance. As I said earlier, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare has again spoken without apparently the authority of the Government. The cloak of collective responsibility seems to have slipped and we now have from time to time rumblings and statements made in peculiar ways and in peculiar places. I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to reconsider their attitude on this question of compiling a census of population. Such work would be labour intensive. I have already dealt with the cost and shown how the cost could be kept at the lowest possible figure while, at the same time, providing a certain amount of employment. Local authorities in conjunction with the Office of Public Works could put in hand certain capital projects, such as the cleaning of water courses, the reclamation of land and, in cooperation with the Department of [844] Lands, the planting of trees. There would be ample scope in such projects for the employment of many men. No heavy machinery would be required. Building sites could be prepared. In the 1940s building sites were prepared in the Crumlin area but, because of the shortage of cement, houses could not be built at that time. These houses were subsequently erected. I have travelled all over the country on numerous occasions and I know there is a great deal of work that could be done on schemes that would be labour intensive but would not require any great capital expenditure. I know the Government are bankrupt, so bankrupt they have not even enough with which to pay a compliment. Problems must be solved. All over the country in every parish there is scope for the development of playgrounds. The unemployed could be taken off the dole queues and put to work on such schemes. I fully agree with John O'Connell——",26/02/1976,20,192,193,be called the political pickpocket of the seventies He has dug deep into every pocket in the country and as,Deputy O'Connell,has pointed out the housewives and the workers are those who are most seriously affected However we have heard no,Deputy O'Connell,1743974_1,,be called the political pickpocket of the seventies He has dug deep into every pocket in the country and as Deputy O'Connell has pointed out the housewives and the workers are those who are most seriously affected However we have heard no,be called the political pickpocket of the seventies He has dug deep into every pocket in the country and as has pointed out the housewives and the workers are those who are most seriously affected However we have heard no,text873,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,0,0,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.323323323,0.323323323,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

684870,781,9,167,Committee on Finance. - Vote 55—Industry and Commerce (Resumed).,07/06/1949,Mr. Daniel Morrissey,Fine Gael,Tipperary,"Well, leave it at that. There are many other things I could say about the cost-of-living index. I want to emphasise again that I am not speaking now solely to the members of the Fianna Fáil Benches, but also to some members on this side of the House who occasionally let themselves loose on the cost-of-living index without taking very much trouble to ascertain the true facts and the real position. In the course of the debate, a large number of items were raised and so far as I can I will try to deal with them. Deputy Lemass referred to a number of matters, but his remarks were, in the main, directed towards certain activities of Córas Iompair Éireann, particularly the proposed new bus station at Store Street, the chassis factory and the springs shop. He said that one, if not the sole, reason why this building was being erected at Store Street was that a central bus station was required. There is no doubt that a bus station is required and also central offices to house all the clerical staff of Córas Iompair Éireann were required. The intention was that Store Street would act not merely as a bus station but also as the central headquarters. It had been calculated that they would save money on it, that it would be cheaper for them to build this place and equip it and transfer all their officers there, than for them to pay rents and other commitments in relation to the present offices at the various railway stations. In my opinion, that was a fallacy. I believe that the interest and sinking fund, even on the original estimate for the cost of the Store Street building, would have been more than any cash commitments they have now to meet in respect of office accommodation. I do not know if it occurred to them to consider to what purpose the evacuated [31] offices at Kingsbridge, Westland Row, Broadstone and various other stations would be put once they had cleared out. I think they would be sheer waste and would become derelict. Situated as they are in the middle of railway stations, right in the heart of the railway work, they could not be let to outside concerns. Whatever might have been the risk, and however well-founded or otherwise their conclusions might have been when they started, those conclusions were founded on an estimate of £450,000 for the building of the station at Store Street. It is going to cost at least twice that amount and I have no hesitation in saying, from the information at my disposal, that before it is completed and ready for occupation by the clerical and headquarters staffs of Córas Iompair Éireann, the cost will exceed £1,000,000. I am not now going into the question as to the wisdom or otherwise of the location. We can debate that on another occasion, if it is thought desirable to do so. Deputy Lemass also asked about the chassis factory and asserted that we were making a cardinal mistake in not proceeding with it. We have no intention of proceeding with the production of chassis there under the agreement or along the lines originally laid down by the board of Córas Iompair Éireann. The building is in course of construction and will be completed, and it will be decided at a later stage for what purpose it will be used. The chassis factory was built, designed and planned for an economic production of ten chassis per week. The estimated requirements of Córas Iompair Éireann itself were only four chassis per week —two lorries and two buses—so that, in order to make it an economic proposition and to produce ten chassis per week—eight of the ten being lorries— they would have to produce six per week, as against their own two, for the competitors outside. On the face of it, that seems to me to be a very adequate reason for stopping the production of chassis in this shop. As it was originally planned by Córas Iompair Éireann, it strikes me as a most extraordinary proposal. With regard to the agreement itself, which [32] they made with Messrs. Leyland, which also contains some rather strange clauses, we can go into that again at a later stage. The same thing applies to the springs shop. The building was under construction and will be completed. Whether springs will or will not be made there is a matter to be decided when we see the position as it will be then. Deputy Lemass also asked me some questions about Cement Limited, the production of cement and the reason for the delay in building the factory extension at Limerick. The company at present is producing cement to the full maximum capacity of the present equipment. The delay in proceeding with the Limerick extension is very simply explained the company is not prepared to proceed with the building of that extension except on terms and conditions to which I am not prepared to agree. The Deputy is quite conversant with that matter himself, as he was dealing with it and negotiating with the cement company during the time he was Minister. The Government is more than anxious that the work at Limerick on this extension would start at the earliest possible moment. We are prepared to agree to what we consider not only reasonable but generous terms and I can only hope that the cement company will see that the conditions and terms to which I am prepared to agree are reasonable and almost on the generous side. Deputy Lemass also referred to the question of steel for shipbuilding. All I can tell the Deputy and the House on that matter is that I have neglected no opportunity since I became Minister to procure the biggest possible allocation of steel for this country for ship building and other purposes. I think I can say I have devoted more time and attention to that matter than perhaps to the procurement of any other raw material for the country. I have not made very much progress. There was over 1948, and there has been to date, some slight improvement and some slight increase, but it is not very substantial. The Deputy, of course, is aware of the steel position in Britain and of the difficulty of getting steel. However, we have made continuous [33] efforts and will continue to press for an increase in the allocation. I want to come now to another important matter, the matter of unemployment. It is a matter in respect of which the speeches made—and again I am not confining my remarks to the Fianna Fáil Party—and the approach to it and in particular to the speech I made in Westport were not facing up to the position in the way in which it must be faced up to. There has been misrepresentation and distortion of what I said, but far from receding from the position I then took up or recalling any word I uttered on that occasion, I want to reiterate and emphasise what I said, because I look upon this matter as a matter of fundamental national importance. In order to clear the ground, perhaps I will be allowed to quote what I did say in Westport. I had been referring to the necessity for increased production I had been urging people to support home industry and I had been outlining certain of the national schemes which the Government had in hand, certain of the schemes were initiated by my predecessor and which this Government decided to proceed with. I should like Deputies to listen carefully to what I am now about to read, because I propose to ask if there is any Deputy on any side of the House who wishes to challenge anything contained in these words. I proceeded to say: 'It is, however, a matter of grave concern to the Government to find that very considerable difficulty is being experienced in obtaining the required number of workers for these schemes. It is indeed remarkable that, at a time when unemployment is regarded as one of our most serious problems, sufficient men cannot be obtained in rural Ireland....' I want Deputies who have been taunting me with expecting city-born and bred workers to go down and cut turf in the bogs to take special note of the fact that I said 'in rural Ireland.' '...for work on turf production and electricity development. Bord na Móna had employment available in 14 counties on production and development [34] work. Having failed to obtain an adequate response from men who had been previously employed by them, the board approached the employment exchanges. The response in this case was also poor, although about 28,000 men with some experience of turf work were registered as unemployed. Radio and newspaper advertising was then resorted to, but as late as a week ago the labour force needed had not been obtained in 11 of the 14 counties concerned. The conditions of employment on turf work are good. The board's rate for unskilled workers is 1/4 per hour for time work, but, whenever possible, work is carried out on piece rates designed to enable the average worker to earn 1/8 per hour and, in fact, good men earn 2/- and over. Camps for workers are provided in Carlow, Kildare, Offaly and Tipperary, and, where adequate labour is not forthcoming locally, whether camps exist or not, Bord na Móna organise lorry trips over a radius of 12 to 15 miles where sufficient numbers can be obtained in towns and villages within that radius. The experience of the Electricity Supply Board on the Erne hydroelectric scheme has been somewhat similar. Owing to the shortage of available labour it has been necessary to recruit workers for the scheme from as far away as Galway, although, at mid-April, there were over 9,200 persons registered as unemployed at the local office in Donegal and over 1,100 in County Sligo. Employment is at present available for an additional 100 unskilled workers, but they are not forthcoming. I understand also that men refused employment on the Erne scheme, preferring instead to go to Scotland as migratory labourers for a few months of the year. Adequate housing and canteens are available on this scheme and unskilled labourers are paid 1/10 per hour for a minimum of 48 hours per week, with the possibility of overtime. I am amazed that Irishmen are prepared to continue in idleness throughout the country when these opportunities for employment have been made available. This state of affairs cannot be tolerated and the persons concerned will have to realise that they cannot be kept in idleness at [35] the expense of hard-working Irish men and women. I have repeatedly emphasised that we cannot even maintain our existing standard of living unless we produce more, and, if some of our citizens are not prepared to produce at all, it is not necessary for me to stress what our future will be.'

3060518,515,9,142,Private Members' Business. - Ansbacher Accounts: Motion.,29/09/1999,Mr. Jim Higgins,Fine Gael,Mayo East,"(Mayo): I am absolutely amazed at the bland, blasé and indifferent approach of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to this issue. I am very surprised, but then again, it was recounted in the House today that if the Tánaiste was sitting where Deputy Quinn was and sat there for a period of time, we would have an entirely different performance from her. I ought not to be surprised because if the Minister sitting beside her, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister who has departed, Deputy Michael Smith, had availed of the hospitality of which she availed there is no doubt that we would have another Sheedy affair and a possible Cabinet stand-off. There seems to be one rule, with regard to moral principles, for the Tánaiste and another when it comes to setting down definitions for others.

2162713,24,9,99,"Criminal Justice Bill, 1983: From the Seanad (Resumed).",07/11/1984,Mrs. Monica Barnes,Fine Gael,Dún Laoghaire,"I wish the debate had not once again descended to the level where people were for or against. Consistently throughout the debate the whole emphasis has been on striving for balance, making sure that the rights of all sides are protected and supported and making sure that the extra powers contained in the Bill would not be abused, particularly in regard to innocent people. I did not think that at this late stage I would have to begin by laying down those foundations again. I found part of Deputy Tunney's speech questionable but I ask his pardon if I have misunderstood him. He felt that some of us were not being honest in talking only of a minority, that really there were a certain number of Deputies who were trying to get at the whole Garda force and undermine this group of people, whom we have actually been striving to support and protect as well. The Garda themselves are the first to suffer from the abuses of a minority. There is no need to go into any further detail. [1438] We who have been elected are concerned not only that the morale of the Garda should be upheld but that the confidence and trust of the public should be upheld. Concern and anxiety have been expressed not just in regard to recent events but also in regard to other matters which have been left unanswered and uninvestigated. This has damaged confidence and trust among the public. It is a matter of balance but our first task as legislators is to guard the civil rights of everyone. I am amazed that Deputy Tunney should be under the impression that we would be damaging the Garda by demanding an independent tribunal and electronic recording. This is not the kind of support and protection which he believes to be in operation in eastern bloc countries. He said this would be a totalitarian invention brought in by the Dáil.

1418503,1066,14,86,Nomination of Members of Government: Motion.,08/05/1970,Mr. David A. Thornley,The Labour Party,Dublin North-West,"The point quite simply is that the Taoiseach places one interpretation on Deputy Moran's resignation while Deputy Boland places a different interpretation on Deputy Moran's resignation. The two interpretations are in direct conflict. One or other gentleman is giving an incorrect version of the circumstances surrounding Deputy Moran's resignation. The credibility of the men on that front bench over there—the Taoiseach included—is so low that one does not know what to believe. Every day we hear correction of statements made yesterday and corrections yesterday of statements made the previous day and, no doubt, there will be corrections tomorrow of statements made today. If the Minister, Deputy Colley, does not know that this country is seething with rumours of one kind or another he must be a very simple man indeed. If the Minister is not aware of the dense atmosphere of distrust and the misgiving that hang over the country in regard to this whole affair then he is a much simpler man than I would have given him credit for being. These questions must be answered. We must be told where the £80,000 came from. Was it State money? Was it private money? Where did it come from? We have heard mention of one captain in the Army whose involvement was described as 'marginal' and who was permitted to resign from the Army. This will have to be investigated. If the enterprise was on the scale which the allegations seem to imply, we are entitled to ask, and to be told, if this was the only Army officer involved. I [812] am not trying to bring the Army into disrepute. The conduct of the Ministers has lowered the morale and reputation of the Army to the point at which they will now be the subject of totally unfair generalisations and suspicions. I am sorry to have to repeat that the standard of political debate here has been lowered now, in one sharp stroke, by the Government and by the Taoiseach. We must now ask whether the ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, really fell off a horse or whether something else happened to him that led to his having to spend some time in hospital. One rumour is that what happened to Deputy Haughey is not unconnected with the events we are debating today. Were other people involved in this enterprise, if it took place? How many people in the Civil Service—if any— were involved? If a coup of this kind was envisaged, you do not bring in £80,000 worth of guns from the continent merely with the help of two Ministers and one Army captain. You do not mount an enterprise of that kind on that kind of strength. This is a very sad debate and this is a very sad subject. In a way, one could gloat at seeing the Government Party in evident disarray. I shall not do that. Too many people whom I like are involved in this. There is too much dispute involved in the practice of politics in this country for anyone to take pleasure now in the very evident humiliation of political opponents. The history of Fianna Fáil has finally caught up with it and broken it as was prophesied for many years. In the 1930s, Fianna Fáil was an honourable party—a small farmer, working-class party—with an honourable tradition. In later years it has slowly and progressively turned into two parties—(1) a party of the past, of tradition, of a kind of mindless republicanism which does more disservice than service to the Republic and (2) it became a fixing, buck-passing, Mercedes-driving Dublin party. It is a strange coalition. Government Deputies have an aversion to coalition but, by heavens, the Fianna Fáil Party is a coalition, as has amply been demonstrated for the past two [813] days. It has governed very effectively as a coalition party. It has Taca as a backing. It is a fine, ruthless organisation. When necessary, Fianna Fáil sent Deputy Blaney and Deputy Boland down to the west and elsewhere to try to build up the old tribal hostilities. Inevitably, this attempt to reconcile those two kinds of political practices was doomed to split wide open—and split it did in the most tragic way possible. If, as the former Deputy J. A. Costello used to boast, perhaps with justice, he had done much to take the gun out of Irish politics then it can equally be said that the present Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, and his colleagues may congratulate themselves on bringing the gun back into Irish politics. It is an achievement for Fianna Fáil to boast about—I do not think. In so doing, they have brought the whole process of democracy into disrepute. We all know the cynicism which is very often displayed by ordinary members of the public towards politicians who tend to think they are all crooks and 'on the make'. People who have been thinking along those lines now have the finest piece of evidence they required in this connection since the inception of this State. In future, it will be very difficult to refute suggestions that other fiddlings are taking place at the top. The entire credibility of ministerial administration has received a severe set-back. The progress of democracy in this country has been set back for 50 years. The position in this country at the moment is so vital that the matter must be referred to the people. I also think that it is so vital that it must be referred to the courts. The truth must be known, one way or another. Perhaps most tragic of all—since we hope the guns did not arrive—the mask of deceit now hangs over the face of every member of the present administration. It hangs not merely over the faces of the outgoing Ministers but over the faces of those who remain and particularly over that of the Taoiseach himself. People will demand that that deceit be swept away. The conflicting statements in the past two days will not suffice they are not good enough they will not be [814] accepted by the people. If this mask of deceit is not stripped away then I think the members of the present Cabinet will have rendered the greatest disservice to Irish democracy since the foundation of our State. It is a tragic and inevitable conclusion of the election in 1957 of the newly-formed Fianna Fáil Cabinet. Of five of that Cabinet—for all of whom I have a great personal goodwill—one Minister is dead and three are now cast into outer darkness. It is a great reflection on the short-lived nature of gains won by human vanity. It is a great reflection on the impermanence of politics. Above all, it is a reflection upon the soul—or lack of it—of those who have been involved in this regime of government since 1957. If any credibility is to be brought back into Irish politics, the Taoiseach must tell us the truth. But it is too late now because nobody would believe him if he did. The Taoiseach has to go.",08/05/1970,19,106,107,statements made the previous day and no doubt there will be corrections tomorrow of statements made today If the Minister,Deputy Colley,does not know that this country is seething with rumours of one kind or another he must be a very,Deputy Colley,1418503_2,,statements made the previous day and no doubt there will be corrections tomorrow of statements made today If the Minister Deputy Colley does not know that this country is seething with rumours of one kind or another he must be a very,statements made the previous day and no doubt there will be corrections tomorrow of statements made today If the Minister does not know that this country is seething with rumours of one kind or another he must be a very,text469,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,-0.055339859,-0.001383496,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.273273273,0.279279279,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2570701,963,14,39,"Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991: Second Stage (Resumed).",26/11/1991,Mr. Toddy O'Sullivan,The Labour Party,Cork North-Central,"I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well in office. It is fair to say that he has always been very pleasant and affable. I have no doubt he will put his communicative skills to good use in the Department of Education. He has been thrown in at the deep end in terms of these Bills. There is also a Green Paper in the offing. While I imagine this is a daunting task for a new Minister I [1013] have no doubt Deputy Davern will apply himself to the job with enthusiasm. There are many problems in the education area, for example, the pupil-teacher ratio prefabs and the need for more home-link and guidance teachers. Unlike the Minister's colleague from County Tipperary, I am not going to give the Minister a shopping list. The Labour Party welcome these Bills in that they will give regional technical colleges greater autonomy in their day-to-day operations. They will also allow the colleges to become involved in research and development and engage in consultive work with industry and business,. This linkage is essential. The Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, indicated she would give consideration to amendments tabled by this side of the House in Committee Stage. I have no doubt that the Minister will repeat that commitment. I look forward to hearing his reply to this debate which will be his maiden speech in this House as Minister for Education. I hope he will be as receptive as his predecessor to the amendments put down by Opposition members which we believe will strengthen the Bill. If there is a weakness in the Bills it relates to the effect of legislation in the labour area. The Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, referred to this. I am referring in particular to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the equality legislation and the part-time workers legislation. At present the vocational education committees are the employers with ultimate responsibility for regional technical colleges. Yet the question of answerability and communication between the regional technical colleges, the chief executive officer and the vocational education committee is suspect. Given the greater autonomy now being devolved on regional technical colleges it is possible that a college could involve their employer, the vocational education committee, in a situation over which they would have no control. This points to a very obvious weakness in the Bill. I hope the Minister will put down the necessary amendments to the Bill or [1014] accept opposition amendment,. People should not be allowed to make deciisons which may not be in the best interests of the college and not answerable at the end of the day. It is conceivable that the board of a college could make a decision which may untimately embarrass the vocational education committee, their employer. I hope the Minister will address this obvious weakness in the Bill. Much criticism has been levelled at the Bill by the IVEA who represent local authorities regarding its centralised nature. Practically all the subsections of section 5 begin with the words, 'subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine'. I do not think it is the Ministers intention to go against the drift towards decentralisation. Yet that is precisely what will happen under these Bills. People have been talking about the need for local democracy. But these Bills fly in the face of what we have been preaching here for many years in regard to the need for decentralisation. This Bill takes account of what transpired in regard to regional technical colleges over the past 21 years. I welcome this. The growth of regional technical colleges has been one of the greatest success stories of recent years. At present 40 per cent of third level students attend regional technical colleges. That is an indication of the success of these colleges. However, as previous speakers said, we have to make these colleges more accessible to people. At present many students are unable to attend third level institutions due to a shortage of space and the fact that their families do not have the means to pay for the third level, education. The Minister should address these problems in the coming year. There is an imbalance in third level education in that many regional technical colleges are opting to run courses on business studies. However, the founding fathers of the technical school movement was to foster technical education. If we are to prosper and come to grips with our unemployment problem, it is absolutely essential that people get involved in technical education. Deputy Garland said technical education was [1015] established for people who were not academically bright. We need to create an environment which will encourage our brightest students to get involved in technical education. If we do not have people who can invent and create jobs there will be no jobs for people who are successful in the area of business studies. For instance, accountants are employed by manufacturers they depend on each other. We need to place greater emphasis on technical education in keeping with the original concept. I wish to refer to the question of accountability. Up to now vocational education committees were subject to scrutiny by the local government auditor. Under this Bill they will be subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General. If anything went wrong in the past the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee was questioned by the local government auditor and matters had to be put right. The success of this system is evident from the fact that after 60 years in existence no major misdemeanour or malpractice has been discovered or highlighted by local government auditors. Under this Bill the Comptroller and Auditor General will carry out the audit on behalf of the Minister and, if he so desires, the Minister may refer it back to the local chief executive officer or the vocational educational committee. This could lead to a breakdown in the system. I wish to refer to the research and development and consultancy provisions in the Bill. We are going into the unknown in this respect. It seems the Minister may inadvertently act in a heavy-handed manner in this area. Colleges will have to give two years advance notice of what courses they will offer. There is not sufficient flexibility for the various colleges to react to situations as they arise.

878863,34,8,108,"Health Bill, 1954—Second Stage (Resumed).",08/07/1954,Mr. Gerald Bartley,Fianna Fáil,Galway West,"We know it. Perhaps some members of the Labour Party do not know it but certainly Deputy James Larkin knows it. He has no doubt whatever about the meaning of the Minister's words. We feel very strongly on this question because the sick poor, the unorganised poor, the people who have no help except what their public representatives can ensure for them, are now being left again. They are now being thrown again to the wolf of ill-health because they cannot pay. Whatever about the prices of essential foods, we think it is more important to ensure that the price of essential medical services should be brought within the competence of all the people. I make no distinction on this matter of health between the rich and the poor. It should be brought within the competence of all the people. Whether we like it or not, very many of them have been put into the category of the middle income group and have been forced to pay for the services which should be provided, and which it was intended should be provided, free. [1538] I do not wish to speak on this matter for the purpose of speaking. I do not want to stand between the Minister and the passing of this Bill if, in fact, the Dáil is going to pass it. I do feel that there is an obligation on me, as representing an area which has a keener interest or as keen an interest in health legislation as any constituency in the country, to ensure that the filching of these rights from them will not be carried out without a protest from me. I want to finish on the note that the Minister is quite consistent. He is doing what his Party said they would do. The Leader of the Fine Gael Party said that when they got the opportunity they would scrap this Act. If they had an over-all majority in this House, the Minister for Health would not have turned to Deputy Larkin yesterday and said: 'We intend to implement this Act but we cannot do it now. We will do it when the facilities are available and when certain ethical objections have been removed.' If the Fine Gael Party had an over-all majority in the House, the Minister for Health would not have made that remark to Deputy Larkin. Deputy Larkin appreciated its significance. That is why we have concentrated so much on the Labour Party in relation to it. He knows what it means. He has no doubt in the world. Whatever Deputy O'Leary may think, Deputy Larkin is under no illusion. Because of that, we on this side of the House protest very vehemently against the cynicism and the reversal of engines of a Party that prodded the Fianna Fáil Party to go much further than in fact we did go.",08/07/1954,15,434,435,relation to it He knows what it means He has no doubt in the world Whatever Deputy O'Leary may think,Deputy Larkin,is under no illusion Because of that we on this side of the House protest very vehemently against the cynicism,Deputy Larkin,878863_7,,relation to it He knows what it means He has no doubt in the world Whatever Deputy O'Leary may think Deputy Larkin is under no illusion Because of that we on this side of the House protest very vehemently against the cynicism,relation to it He knows what it means He has no doubt in the world Whatever Deputy O'Leary may think is under no illusion Because of that we on this side of the House protest very vehemently against the cynicism,text518,5,0,0,0,40,-0.125,-5,-2.397895273,-0.059947382,-0.181830965,-0.004545774,0.011011011,0.002002002,0.002002002,0.024024024,0.129129129,0.157157157,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1632449,918,8,131,"Financial Statement, 1974: Motion (Resumed).",01/05/1974,Mr. Desmond J. O'Malley,Fianna Fáil,Limerick East,"The changes of mind on the part of the Minister for Finance almost amount to a saga in themselves. I recall last year on the Finance Bill that Deputy Tunney and I pointed out what we regarded as the gross inequity of what was described then as the 'claw-back'. We heard about that in 1973 but we are not hearing anything about it this year. The claw-back was a kind of disguised inequity of increasing the income tax of certain people so far as children's allowances were concerned or, to put it the other way, of on paper giving them increases in children's allowances but taking the whole lot back by increasing their income tax. I do not know who thought of the name 'claw-back' first but it had a lot of notoriety last year. Deputy Tunney and myself, among others, remonstrated with the Minister for Finance about the inequity of it, the fact that it was done in a concealed and surreptitious fashion and that it could possibly be as long as six months or more before a lot of people who were affected by it realised the way they were being treated. The Minister was quite scathing in his reply to Deputy Tunney and myself. He told us that the claw-back was entirely justifiable, that he was [587] not going to change it in spite of the suggestions made by us and that he was never going to change it. Deputy Tunney quoted what he said in volume 272, column 223. The Minister last year said: Does he not know that the whole science of competent, progressive Government is to transfer the burden from those who canot afford to bear it to those who can? That is what we have done and we make no apology for it. We will do it again next year and we will get the support of the people. What did he do this year? Very quietly and I would say almost surreptitiously, without ever referring to the words that were so beloved by him last year, he did away with the claw-back. He said he was saving £2 million last year by having the claw-back, that it was taken from the rich to give to the poor, that it was inequitable to a large variety of people and the number of children a man had was not taken into account at all. There was a saving of £2 million which could be given out as a result and anyone who suggested there was anything wrong with the clawback was only interested in the rich and all the rest of it. This year in the budget the claw-back is gone and we have an increase of 30p per month, or 7p per week, in children's allowances given to everybody. All the elaborate paraphernalia introduced in the claw-back last year on different income tax allowances for different children, depending on the income of the father, is all gone and there is a flash allowance this year of £200 and everyone gets the £200 for every qualified child irrespective of income and irrespective of the age of the child. The net result of this had been, and this has not been commented on at all, that while the less well off, those under £2,500 per annum, get this wonderful increase of 7 pence per week—one of our Deputies described it yesterday as just about enough nowadays to buy a bag of crisps and [588] an ice pop—those over £2,500 per annum have this year got an increase of £1. 80p per month because they get last year's £1. 50p, which they did not get last year because of the claw-back, which has now gone and they get the 30p as well. They are doing very well. I do not grudge it to them. I do not say it is a wrong thing to do. All I do is comment very wryly indeed, on the fact that the Minister for Finance saw fit to jeer and sneer at Deputy Tunney and others on this side of the House when they suggested the arrangement was inequitable. They were told it was not inequitable and the Government would do it again this year and continue to do it. It is interesting to note now what they have, in fact, done. This is another one of the changes of mind the Minister for Finance has had. He has these when he calms down now and again, when he has one of his more lucid intervals which, fortunately, he does have from time to time. It will be interesting to see whether the provision which Deputy Murphy, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, did not seem to know about until I told him about it this evening—something he will no doubt get on his bicycle about and endeavour to keep out of the Finance Bill—will appear in the Finance Bill because, as the Parliamentary Secretary now seems to think, I do not think it will appear. On the question of income tax generally, and the way in which it has been dealt with this year, a great many people have been misled by a comparison of the personal allowances as they were and the personal allowances now proposed in this budget. The figures quoted were correct. There was this considerable increase in personal allowances but what was never got across to the public was the fact that earned income relief, one of the most valuable reliefs for the ordinary working man, has, in fact, been abolished. The public were not told that at all. The net result is that, when you take into account the fact that this has been abolished, the saving in income [589] tax for the average man is very slight indeed. It is as little as £30 in the year for the average wage earner, about 60p per week or thereabouts. A number of things come to light as one examines the budget, things one could not clearly see because of their being hidden in the budget. There are some interesting facts. As a result of the abolition of earned income relief and the proposal for a lower first rate of income tax, and the abolition of the standard rate as such, and the lowering of the first rate for the first £1,550 of taxable income from 35p in the £ to 26 point something pence in the £, you have the situation that those who are getting relief at the moment on things like life assurance premiums, mortgage interest repayments, voluntary health insurance premiums and bank interest generally will now be faced with a situation in which, having saved 35p in the £ in taxation last year, they will save only 26 point something pence in the £ this year if they are within that particular income bracket in other words, to that extent they are worse off. They are the people paying the lowest rate of tax but, as a result of the abolition of surtax and the introduction of one single system, which is something I agree with in principle, those who are at the highest level of taxation, which in this budget is 80 pence in the £, will find themselves in the situation in which on things like life insurance premiums they will get relief from the Revenue to the extent of 80 pence in every £ they spend. The obvious thing for them to do is to borrow as much as they can up to the new limit of £2,000 interest, take out as much life insurance as they can up to the limit of one-sixth of their income, owe as much on their houses as they can and have as high health insurance as they can because they will get value for these. In effect, they will only pay 20 pence in the £ even though they are actually shelling out 100 pence in each £ because the other 80 pence would go to the Revenue Commissioners anyway and it is just as well to get value for it and let them have some return. More [590] power to them if they do this and this is what they will do. What I object to is the giving of this rate incentive to those at the top level of incomes, those paying at the highest rates on the highest incomes. The contrary is the case with those paying at the lowest rate because, instead of saving at the standard rate of 35 per cent, as they did last year, they are now getting relief at the new low rate of 26 point something per cent, which is the rate applicable to the first £1,550 of taxable income. Were these consequences, I wonder, foreseen by the Minister when he introduced his budget? Now that they have been seen, are we going to see anomalies and inequities of this kind introduced in the Finance Bill? I sincerely hope we will not. I think we will have a repeat of last year. Lots of things in the budget will not appear in the Finance Bill it will not be just the one or two things that we had last year. Another consequence of the abolition of earned income relief is that the man who lives on investments becomes better off vis-à-vis the man who works for his living.",01/05/1974,20,204,205,were affected by it realised the way they were being treated The Minister was quite scathing in his reply to,Deputy Tunney,and myself He told us that the claw-back was entirely justifiable that he was 587 not going to change it,Deputy Tunney,1632449_3,,were affected by it realised the way they were being treated The Minister was quite scathing in his reply to Deputy Tunney and myself He told us that the claw-back was entirely justifiable that he was 587 not going to change it,were affected by it realised the way they were being treated The Minister was quite scathing in his reply to and myself He told us that the claw-back was entirely justifiable that he was 587 not going to change it,text701,3,1,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-0.84729786,-0.021182447,-0.252982213,-0.006324555,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.153153153,0.163163163,0.082082082,0.112112112,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
683923,1075,8,88,Committee on Finance. - Vote 55—Industry and Commerce (Resumed).,01/06/1949,Mr. Oscar Traynor,Fianna Fáil,Dublin North-East,"We are criticising in a way that the members of the Government Party do not appear to like. It is our duty to do so and because we feel it to be our duty we are going to exercise our rights to criticise. An extraordinary thing happened here to-day in respect to a question which was tabled by Deputy Con Lehane. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in reply to a supplementary question put by the Deputy, said that there was no shortage of labour for essential building. The Minister, in the course of his own statement, said the main limiting factor in the building industry is the shortage of skilled workers. One or the other of these gentlemen is correct, and I am prepared to believe that the Minister is correct because otherwise I feel sure that a greater effort would be put into the construction and the provision of houses for the workers of this city. But, however that may be, the workers are not there, and they are not there because there was no employment for them in the early part of 1947. That, in my opinion, was, in the main, due to the fact that licences for essential building work were not forthcoming, and, naturally, these skilled workers, when they could not secure employment, emigrated. The Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his reply to a question to-day, did say that there was work here for any of those men who returned. I think it was on Saturday last that I read in the evening papers a letter which purported to have come from a skilled worker. He suggested that he had returned here from England, where he had been gainfully employed, and that he had returned because of the fact that he had been informed there was plenty of work here for men of his craft. He stated, I think, that he was now back five weeks, and had still failed to find employment. He said that was poor encouragement for his fellow-workers, who were in England, to return here. I do not know if the Minister responsible for housing could make these licences available. If he could, it would, of course, greatly aid the Minister for Industry and Commerce [2350] in reducing the considerable number of unemployed which still exists. Deputy Cowan was preening himself more or less on the fact that the cost of living here had at last been stabilised. But that is not what the Parties on the opposite side promised the people. Every single section of them promised to reduce the cost of living by a considerable percentage. One of the bids went to the extent of something like 30 per cent. However that may be, Deputy Cowan is a very much wiser man to-day. He is now inclined to do a little bit of bragging on the fact that the cost of living has been stabilised. He was a member of the Party which promised to end emigration which was bleeding this country white. I am sure that to-day he is a sadder and a wiser man with regard to the position which exists in relation to emigration. Emigration has not been brought to an end, as the public were promised it would be by reason of the employment which these gentlemen proposed they would procure for the unemployed. So that we have that problem still. The Minister himself on one occasion made the statement in this House that it was a problem which could be solved in 24 hours. I have no doubt that he may have believed that at the time he made the statement by reason of the fact that he had not the experience which he has since gained during his period in office. That may be all to the good. It probably means that we will have a much better informed Dáil in the future as a result of the experience gained by the members of the Government while in office. Deputy Cowan also deplored the fact that boys in this city are unable to secure employment, that they are more or less running wild through the streets of the city, and that parents were caused considerable pain because of their failure to fix those boys in some kind of employment. I would like to remind the Deputy that the former Government did something—I am not going to describe it as a remedy—to try and meet that particular statement of his. At any rate, it was an effort [2351] to try and do something to deal with the situation which existed in regard to these boys. I refer to the establishment of the Construction Corps. As most Deputies will remember, it aimed at taking these boys off the streets and of teaching them, as far as it was possible to teach them, a craft, or to give them the skill which it is necessary for a skilled labourer to possess. As a result of the establishment of that corps, quite a large number of these boys, taken away from the dangers which existed on the streets, were trained and disciplined. The teaching of discipline is a very necessary asset for every boy. They were disciplined and, generally, they were made better citizens than they otherwise would be. I am quite prepared to admit that that was not the work of the Army, and if the Minister for Defence conceived it to be his duty to disestablish the Construction Corps by reason of the fact that it was not a unit of the Army, he was perfectly entitled to do so. I mention that by way of suggesting, in reply to the remarks of Deputy Cowan, that perhaps the Minister might consider the possibility of taking over that idea, and that some means might be devised whereby these boys could be given the same type of training as that which was given to the boys who were in the Construction Corps. That is a matter that might be taken up either by the Minister's Department or the Department of Education. I am now going to refer to a matter that I know is not in the Estimate. I am aware of the fact that the Minister, in reply to a suggestion by Deputy Lemass about Córas Iompair Eireann, said that the work on the station in Store Street had not ceased. The impression that I have from passing that building every day in the week and sometimes twice a day, is that all work on the building has ceased. There may, of course, be a good reason for that.",01/06/1949,13,391,392,course greatly aid the Minister for Industry and Commerce 2350 in reducing the considerable number of unemployed which still exists,Deputy Cowan,was preening himself more or less on the fact that the cost of living here had at last been stabilised,Deputy Cowan,683923_3,,course greatly aid the Minister for Industry and Commerce 2350 in reducing the considerable number of unemployed which still exists Deputy Cowan was preening himself more or less on the fact that the cost of living here had at last been stabilised,course greatly aid the Minister for Industry and Commerce 2350 in reducing the considerable number of unemployed which still exists was preening himself more or less on the fact that the cost of living here had at last been stabilised,text893,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.184147377,0.004603684,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.733733734,0.687687688,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1000002,894,9,93,Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 9—General (Resumed).,28/04/1959,Mr. Michael Joseph O'Higgins,Fine Gael,Dublin South-West,"My object in speaking is to close this debate, so far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned. We have had a discussion for a number of days on this Budget and I think it is worth noting that in the Budget of 1959, the Minister set out deliberately to bring in, in so far as it is possible for a Fianna Fáil Minister to do it, a Budget which he believed would be a popular Budget. We know that this Budget was introduced because of the political situation which faces the Minister and his colleagues in the next six weeks or so. In that regard, the Budget has been rather a damp squib. It has not aroused the hoped for interest and I believe, on examination, it will be found that the people expected a great deal more and are sorely disappointed with its provisions. Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Dillon and other Deputies on this side of the House have called into question the manner in which the Minister has [1160] framed this Budget. A charge has been made that, this year, the Minister, for the immediate purposes he had to meet, did a certain amount of juggling with the figures. A charge has been made that in relation to the year just ended where the Minister claims a small surplus, in fact, had he adopted accepted methods, he would have closed with quite a serious deficit. It certainly causes some anxiety when we find that last year the Minister deliberately transferred from capital account moneys that were received for that purpose. He also adopted the resort of borrowing for certain commitments which previously had been met out of current revenue. The House has been reminded that if the Minister had applied the same methods as were applied by his predecessor, if he had permitted the receipts from the special import levies to go for capital purposes, as was the intention, then the year which has closed would have ended with a deficit of around £4,000,000. We all know that depending on the method adopted and depending on the point of view adopted, quite a different story can be told with any set of figures. One cannot help being doubtful about what has been done this year. There is little doubt that in the Minister's mind, the wish was father to the thought. He desired to be able to say this year: 'Well, here we are with a surplus behind us and we are now able to give certain reliefs to the people.' The fact is that these reliefs are contained in a Budget which the Minister claims will balance because of certain expedients which he has adopted. He is borrowing where he should not he is assuming where he should not and some day the bills which he is incurring now will have to be paid. Of course, that day will not be in the next few weeks it will be a day when some other Minister will have to meet the exigencies created now for political purposes by the present Minister for Finance. It has been demonstrated clearly in this debate that a juggling of figures has taken place, that a change in the accounts has been decided upon by the Minister in order to introduce a political Budget. We accuse the Minister [1161] and the Government of doing crooked things with the national finances. We believe that this is a crooked Budget, designed to bring about the adoption of the straight vote system by the people in the coming Referendum. It will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say on the very careful analysis of this Budget and the last two Budgets made by Deputy Sweetman. We are supposed to believe, if we are to take seriously the speeches made by the Minister and his colleagues in this debate, that the country is out of its difficulties now, that all of us are feeling better, that we are far better off, that the dark clouds have been wiped away and that the sun is beginning to shine again. I wonder if people outside listen patiently to that kind of talk. Do Members of the Government and their supporters here seriously believe that merely by saying things of that kind they are proving anything? The object of the Opposition in this debate has been to wipe away some of the clouds of nonsense which have been spread by the present Government. What are the facts? The Government were elected two years ago in the height of an economic crisis. They were elected in an election which became necessary at a time when this country was face to face with a serious economic problem. The year 1956— particularly the latter part of it—had been a bad year for Ireland, just as it had been bad for most other countries in this part of the world. The economic blizzards blowing then beset us, just as they did more powerful and richer countries. We ran a balance of payments problem of serious dimensions and the then Government courted and experienced considerable unpopularity because they faced up to their responsibility in relation to the country and applied certain solutions for that problem, which meant hardship for certain sections of the people. But what had to be done was done. Despite the unpopularity involved, the then Government, having decided their course, proceeded to act accordingly. The Fianna Fáil Party at that time were not a bit choosey in what they said. They were prepared then to [1162] make political capital out of Ireland's national difficulties. I assert it as a fact that in 1956 the Fianna Fáil Party procceded to shake the confidence of ordinary people in this country of ours. They created a national malaise whereby young people, even in decent employment, left their jobs and emigrated, not merely to England but elsewhere. It was by the activities of the Fianna Fáil Party and their tied Press two years ago that Irish people began to doubt whether Ireland itself had a future to offer to the people growing up here. That was a disgusting campaign, initiated, guided and piloted by the leaders of Fianna Fáil for the purpose of getting office and for nothing else. They succeeded. They succeeded by speeches and by posters displayed around the country: 'Support us enable us to beat the crisis.' Here in Dublin, decent women were told that merely by the expedient of putting a pencil to paper and voting for Fianna Fáil candidates they could vote their man a job. Two years ago in every part of this country our people were led to believe that by putting Fianna Fáil back into office unemployment would be solved, emigration would be stemmed and the problems facing this country would be overcome. It is well to remember that, at the time when these gentlemen were fishing in troubled waters, when they were trying to make political capital out of Ireland's difficulties, they entered into certain pledges. It is well to review those pledges in this annual Budget. They guaranteed that they would solve unemployment, they guaranteed that they would stem emigration, they assured the people that our warnings—that food subsidies would be abolished—were so much nonsense. The Tánaiste went so far as to ask in a very plaintive manner how often it was necessary for himself and his colleagues to deny that, if they were elected, bread would cost more, butter would cost more and the food subsidies would be abolished. They were sent into office, not to sit and doodle but to carry out the pledges they made. It is our opportunity now, two years later, to examine this Budget, not in relation to what is in it but in [1163] relation to what is not in it, in relation to the policy which it is supposed to enshrine and the results of that policy over the last two years. Let me take unemployment first. After two years of a Fianna Fáil Government, there are 32,000 fewer people at work in this land of ours. Does that figure bring even a feeling of uneasiness to Fianna Fáil Deputies? If I were a member of a Party that led me to say to my constituents in the last general election: 'Support me and my colleagues and we will put your men folk to work,' and if I found that my Government, after two years in office, succeeded in putting 32,000 more people out of work, I would hang my head in shame. The figures are there. In the year just concluded there were 10,000 fewer people at work than there were in 1957 32,000 fewer people at work than there were in 1956 50,000 fewer people at work than there were in 1955. There is the record of the Government that were sent into office pledged to put our people back to work. We know, also, that emigration has continued to be a problem. We have not seen any evidence in the last two years of any serious plan or policy to stem emigration. One of the Minister's colleagues, not so long ago, jocosely offered £1,000,000 to anyone who would give the Government a policy to end emigration. That may be a very nice joke in an after-dinner speech but Fianna Fáil Ministers will not be permitted now, in office, to get away with a statement that emigration is insoluble because they pledged themselves to solve it and we are entitled in this annual debate to see some evidence of this problem being contained, if not solved. We know well that the 32,000 people who are not now at work in Ireland are at work somewhere else. They are working in England, Canada, Australia and elsewhere because, in the last two years, this Government, that pledged themselves to find jobs for them, have not succeeded in doing it. That has been the record of the Government in relation to unemployment and emigration. [1164] People are supposed to be galvanised into enthusiasm for this fading Government because in this Budget 2/6d. is given to old age pensioners and an inevitable 6d. is taken off income tax. If the Minister thinks that that is any real solution to the social injustice caused by his Government in the last two years, he is very much mistaken. Deputies should remember that this Budget enshrines in the financial structure of the country food taxation amounting to £9 millions. Under this Budget, by reason of what is not in it, the people will continue to pay 4d. more for the 21b. loaf, 6d. a 1b. more for butter, 2/8d. more for a stone of flour. These increases in food prices are enshrined in this Budget although two years ago the Government pledged itself, through its leader and its deputy leader, not to interfere with food subsidies. Despite these burdens imposed on the people, Fianna Fáil Deputies, Government spokesmen here, have felt that a 2/6d. increase in the old age pension is a considerable measure of social relief. I should think that there are only two sections in our community that have not had the money they are paid adjusted in any way in respect of changes in the cost of living and those two sections are old age pensioners and Members of the Oireachtas. We know that the pound note today, in terms of real values in relation to 1939, is worth 6/8d. The pound today is worth one-third of the pre-war pound. Prior to the war, the old age pensioner in this country was in receipt of a pension of 10s. a week. To provide that pensioner with even the same purchasing power as he had pre-war, obviously, the pension should now be 30/- per week. Of course, the Minister does not give him that. Half a crown is given where five shillings should have been given and the person receiving it is told that the State could not afford to go any further. I am sure there is a way in which the Minister can explain these matters but it is very little consolation to an old age pensioner to be told that the State cannot afford to pay him merely what he was being paid in 1939 at a time when the Government who say [1165] that propose to spend £6,000,000 on the purchase of jet aircraft. I am quite certain that the Minister will be able to explain that position to his own satisfaction and to the satisfaction of certain Deputies but I doubt very much if he will be able to explain it to the unfortunate man or woman who is told now that the State cannot afford to pay him or her, by means of an old age pension, merely what the old age pensioner was getting prior to the war. Having said that this Government were elected to do certain things in relation to unemployment, emigration and the cost of living, I should add that in the last two years, since they were elected to office, everything has broken their way. They have not had to face the economic crisis that faced the country in 1956. They have not had to face it, by reason of the fact that the problem was broken by their predecessors. When the Minister took up office as Minister for Finance, he was advised that the worst was over, and he had the satisfaction of seeing, in March, 1957, that the trend in our balance of payments had been reversed, and that things were beginning to go the right way. I am sure he could not help being amused by the fact that his predecessor had to bear all the opprobrium, and the slings and arrows, in getting the problem solved which he found solved when he went into office. At the end of 1957, the Minister found by reason of the steps taken by his predecessor, that this country, for the first time for a number of years, had a surplus of £9 million in its balance of payments. Last year, there was a favourable turn in the terms of trade, so far as this country was concerned. Import prices dropped and our trading problem became far easier and, therefore, in the past two years, there has not been any serious economic problem facing the Minister. The sun was shining, and all that was necessary was that somebody should go out and work. That has not been done. An opportunity has been let pass in the past two years. We have heard a lot of talk about plans we have had the issue of different documents, plans for economic development and all the rest of [1166] it we have had pep talks over weekends from the Minister for Lands and other Ministers, all designed to make us feel better. After all the talk and plans have been brushed aside, what remains? —more unemployment, more emigration, less being produced from agriculture, gross national output down, the cost of living up, saving down, and the beginnings—it may be just vague at the moment—of a new problem in our balance of payments. That is a serious situation and it means that the Government have been trying to cod the people for the past 12 months. One could talk about these great plans for economic development for the next five years, but I wonder do Deputies who have spoken about this plan to invest £220 million in Irish enterprise, in capital development for the next five years realise that that is a reduction in the plans in operation when the inter-Party Government were in office. The Fianna Fáil Government were to invest £44 million a year at the time when they were trying to break the last inter-Party Government, but capital investment was then running at the rate of £44½ millions, so there is now a cutdown in the investment programme, and we are supposed to feel that something great is being done when the Minister and his colleagues have merely totted together the five years' commitment, instead of taking it year by year. We, in the Fine Gael Party, have availed of the opportunity in this debate to review carefully and fully the policy of the Government for the past 12 months, and since they assumed office. As the Leader of the Opposition said this afternoon in relation to the reliefs in the Budget, the reliefs are three. First of all, there is no new taxation, which is a bit strange for a Fianna Fáil Budget secondly, there is a reduction in income tax which may or may not have been inevitable and thirdly, there is the half-loaf for the old age pensioners. To the extent that there is some measure of relief given in the Budget, we do not intend to divide the House on the issue, but we do say very [1167] earnestly to the Minister that merely because some measure of relief is given, we in the Opposition will not cease to remind the Minister and his colleagues in the Government that they were not elected to the House merely to indulge in constitutional reforms or merely to call for or to dictate referenda. They were not sent here to indulge in new methods of electing different Parliaments. They were sent here to do a job of work, and that job is to provide employment here in Ireland for at least as many men and women as were working here two years ago. That job is to provide here the means whereby we can so manage our affairs that young Irish boys and girls will not have to continue to emigrate and seek employment elsewhere. Until the Government give more evidence that they are taking their task seriously, we shall continue to point out their mistakes. Major de Valera: This Budget debate has, in a sense, been unusual in the attitude the principal Opposition Party have taken to it because, they cannot, apparently, quarrel with the provisions the Minister has made and they are very busy making excuses as to why they will not divide and have not divided so far. At the same time, they take the opportunity to use this measure, which apparently must have their approval, for backhanded digs at the Minister and the Government. I am afraid that is the actual position. Two things, therefore, are involved in this debate. The first is the question of the actual Budget, which is the proper subject for the debate, and then there is the question of the over-all background in regard to the Budget itself. As other speakers have said, the reliefs which the Minister has been able to give are not all that people would have wished to give, if the giving were in their power. I should like to emphasise and repeat something the Tánaiste said here earlier this evening. He pointed out that, perhaps with an exception here and there in parliamentary history, by and large, no matter what [1168] Party or group Deputies belonged to, no matter what the constitution of government is, Ministers all wanted to do the best they could for the community and the people as a whole, when they are in office or in charge of government. A realisation of that point will help us here. It is not good for Parliament and it is not healthy for constructive work if one sees unworthy motives where there are no such motives whatever, and that seems to be the stand taken by certain people. When it comes to framing Budgetary proposals for the year two things are uppermost in the minds of the Minister for Finance and the Government. Apart from the long-term interest of the country is the desire to do the best they can for the various interests in the community that are deserving of relief and for the community as a whole, if possible, in the order of priority that the situation rationally dictates. Secondly, there must be uppermost in their minds the consideration as to how the money is to be found to deal with those practical problems. The first desire is to give and the second desire is not to take unnecessarily. No Government wishes to increase the burden of taxation and, putting it at the lowest level, political considerations alone dictate that a Government should not increase the burden of taxation and that reliefs should be given where possible. Those two desires are not always compatible and it is necessary that a balance be struck. When problems arise action has to be taken and it is much to the credit of successive Governments that appropriate action has been taken frequently. My quarrel with Coalitions is that they let their problems develop to such proportions that they could not cope with them, but that is another story. We have heard a good deal of criticism about the small value of the reliefs given under this Budget. Nobody knows better than the people on this side of the House what that means. There have been attacks on particular things. They complain about the relief given to the cinemas others have said that more should be given to the old [1169] age pensioners and, though it has not been said explicitly, there are reasons for putting those two things together. Anybody who tries to look at the problem fairly and impartially will realise that the reason reliefs are not bigger and that more cannot be done is simply the problem of financing them. Any person who has experience of government, like the last speaker who was a Minister, will see the reality of that argument. When it comes to a question of priorities as to who should get how much, that is fair ground for argument, provided it is reasonable argument, because perhaps no two men's judgment will completely accord in a position such as that of Minister for Finance. Ultimately he must face up to the question whether he is in a position to give anything at all and, if he is, how much he can give and how it should be distributed. Undoubtedly, a reasonable case can be made for alternative distribution but I do not think I should waste the time of the House by going into such a hypothetical situation. It is enough to say that, on the advice he has received in the Department of Finance and after consultation with his colleagues, he has proposed a certain scheme which, to say the least of it, is popular enough to influence the main Opposition Party, at any rate, in its attitude towards it so far as the Division Lobby is concerned. That, of course, I realise does not necessarily mean that there would not be argument about distribution and I do not want to make too much of a point about that. We have heard sneers at the amount given to old age pensioners. Even Deputy O'Higgins, who was a Minister in the previous Government, has taken that line. The criterion must be the amount that is available. If it is decided to double the amount to be granted to such people, that extra money must be found and there is only one way the State finds its money as we have all discovered now. The last Coalition Budget and other Budgets proved one thing, that after all the abstract and airy fairy economic and financial theories which have been very popular not only here but in other [1170] countries, if you want to spend you must get the money to spend. It does not grow on trees. As regards the relief given to cinemas. I must confess that if it were merely a question of amusement I would be tempted to go with those people who say it is not a priority. If it is a question of deciding between the old age pensioner and a person who has a few shillings in his pocket and wants to go to the pictures one or two nights in the week, there is no Deputy who would not say: 'We must give the old age pensioner priority.' However, the matter is not as simple as that. The picture houses, however they grew up, whether they are good or bad, represent an economic activity. They have a certain employment content and people are dependent for their livelihood on the cinemas. It also has a certain trade value. You cannot blind yourself to the fact that this is an industrial activity in which there is a certain employment content, however small. It may be argued that much money is exported for films but the only reason I advert to that is that you cannot measure a thing like that by measuring only the number of people employed, and so on. There are repercussions out beyond that into the economic environment which make it a serious thing if such an activity is to fail completely or particularly if it is to fail suddenly. I think that this Government, and other governments, too, can assert that it is cheap to charge a government with doing a thing like that merely for the sake of popularity. So far as the person who goes to the pictures is concerned, I do not think a thing like that gets a government any vote. Every Government will be bombarded and I am sure Deputy Sweetman's Government was similarly bombarded with requests, claims, many of them with some substance in the claim, all of them clamouring for something from a Minister for Finance who is strictly circumscribed in what he has to give, and the little he has to give will not go around all the things he would like it to. That is not only the background for [1171] the Budget but it is a background for, I would say, all Budgets. The same type of argument must be applied when people talk about service pensions or what was done in regard to retiral pensions in this Budget. Those who want to sneer can make arithmetic computations and suggest that these things are trivial. Again, you have the problem of getting more to make them more substantial. I simply ask this question, which undoubtedly is arguable! Would it have been better for the Minister for Finance to plump for certain things and totally omit some of the things he has provided for or give a distribution such as he has given? You cannot escape this question. Taking the finances as a whole and taking the whole economic background of the country into the Budget, I do not think the Minister can go any further in the question of giving, that is, in the question of reliefs, than he has done. What the Minister has done is indicated by the present situation. I do not think anybody looking at these figures could safely—I use the word 'safely' from the point of view of the country—suggest a greater measure of spending or relief. That being granted, you have the open question: should he have distributed it as he did or plumped for one or two things? If the Opposition want to argue that —it is a fair argument—then let them come a little up the road with me and oblige us by saying precisely what we should drop. If they want to pursue that line, I think it would be reasonable to suggest, at least in broad outline, alternative proposals. I suppose that in democratic parliament it has become the prerogative of the Opposition to make the criticism but to forbear from giving a constructive answer. Perhaps I cannot complain too much about that. Certainly, from this side of the House, I can make my point that that is the only choice. Looking at the reliefs the Minister has given I am not prepared to say: Throw any one of them overboard and add it on to any one of the rest of them. There is something broader than [1172] that behind this Budget but I think this disposes of the sneers—I am afraid that that is all I can call them—coming from certain quarters about the size of the reliefs which are given. I know that that does not completely answer the people who say that more should be given because there is a broader ground coming from another quarter. There is a school of thought that we should have given benefits in certain regards, irrespective of the money available to the Minister for Finance. I am afraid I cannot subscribe to this policy. As I have already said, after all the experimentation and speculation in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and, I would say, the early 1950s, in national economics, the hard facts are such as to prove that a Government and a Minister for Finance must arrange that a country lives within its resources. Apart from these details, there is another aspect of this Budget which I think is important. Again I should like to be as fair and as objective as one can be in assessing the situation. I want to try to avoid a temptation which Deputy O'Higgins has put in my way. I want to try to avoid apportioning things meticulously, as he, rather naïvely, tried to do. I was surprised at a man of his intelligence trying to play the old trick of 'We are completely white. We did everything. You are completely black. You have never done anything.' Life is not like that. The argument might be more convincing if life were accepted as life is. The fact is, therefore, that some time ago you definitely had a crisis. You had a crisis in 1955-56 when there was a very difficult situation here. Certain action was taken. It is an old story now. I do not think recriminations will help. One important point, as a fact, that has to be adverted to is that following that crisis, and the measures taken to deal with it, there was a rather serious depression here. To my knowledge, there was a serious business depression in the city of Dublin and there were the problems that accompany depression. I think Deputy O'Higgins would have helped very much in a constructive argument if, in trying to make capital out of unemployment figures as they are at any [1173] particular time, it were realised that at that time the actual unemployment figures, I think, were higher than they are now. The point I want to make is that there was a contraction, a depression, which brought in its train, inevitably, a certain amount of unemployment and which also brought in, of course, a certain amount of emigration. It is only fair that I should say I completely appreciate the external factors that were operating in that situation, but that was a fact. The external situation was a real fact and so also were the things I mentioned real facts. The result was a very damaging effect on what the businessman or the economist calls 'confidence'. It had an extremely damaging effect on public confidence. I feel that the expression 'public morale' is better. That unfortunate effect was very much aggravated by the fact that a coalition Government were in office. I give full credit to that Government, particularly to its Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, but, as probably Deputy O'Higgins knows better than I do, there are fundamental difficulties when an unhomogeneous group is trying to cope with a crisis like that. However it may be, at large, in business circles, amongst the farmers, in the country as a whole, there was an atmosphere of depression and a lack of confidence.",28/04/1959,16,946,947,to 1162 make political capital out of Ireland's national difficulties I assert it as a fact that in 1956 the,Fianna Fáil,Party procceded to shake the confidence of ordinary people in this country of ours They created a national malaise whereby,Fianna Fáil,1000002_7,,to 1162 make political capital out of Ireland's national difficulties I assert it as a fact that in 1956 the Fianna Fáil Party procceded to shake the confidence of ordinary people in this country of ours They created a national malaise whereby,to 1162 make political capital out of Ireland's national difficulties I assert it as a fact that in 1956 the Party procceded to shake the confidence of ordinary people in this country of ours They created a national malaise whereby,text148,3,3,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.243332132,-0.006083303,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.094094094,0.122122122,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2847186,1013,8,92,"Private Members' Business. - Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1996: Second Stage.",25/06/1996,Mr. Eoin Ryan,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South-East,"I thank my colleague, Deputy de Valera, for sharing her time. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I welcome and support the Bill and congratulate Deputy Quill on bringing it forward. It is obvious the Deputy put an enormous amount of work into the preparation of the Bill which is a timely move by herself and her party. I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill. The principle of this Bill, which aims to protect the interiors and surroundings of buildings not protected at present and to strengthen existing provisions for listed buildings, has already been strongly advocated by Fianna Fáil. As my party's spokesperson on urban renewal, I recently published Fianna Fáil's policy position on Georgian Dublin. That policy, which my party is committed to implementing in Government, aims to rejuvenate as a living quarter the heart of Dublin, which is its Georgian squares and streets. Fianna Fáil also recognises the potential for similar schemes to be put into operation in many provincial towns. In proposing a package of tax measures to encourage the conversion of Georgian houses from offices and bedsits into family homes and some measure of mixed usage, the need for legislation such as this was recognised as a vital plank in the development of our built heritage. This Bill is timely and worthwhile. The present situation is recognised by all sides as inadequate. The listing of buildings is totally inadequate and provides little practical protection. The destruction of our built heritage, once wholesale, continues at a steady and corrosive pace. Ireland, in comparison with other European countries, has a relatively small stock of historic buildings. Consequently, we must exercise a special duty of care. There is palpable anger and considerable shame among this generation at the historical neglect of our built heritage. Remarks about 'belted earls' and the 'blue rinse brigade' that at one time roused a cheer are now rightly viewed with embarrassment. This Bill seeks to address the fact that, [1267] although opinion has moved on, the law has not. The law is entirely inadequate to protect our heritage. When this Bill was published, I was working on introducing a similar Bill. I congratulate Deputy Quill on her work and timing. There is an urgent need to tackle the problem whereby listing a building gives no protection to the interior and surroundings of an historic structure. Dublin has been scarred forever by gaping holes where once stood beautiful and historic staircases, carved marble fireplaces and stunning plaster ceilings. What has replaced these fixtures, when the entire structure has not been destroyed, has been infill that varies from the inadequate to the appalling. The latest victim of the present official malaise is 15 Usher's Quay. Famous for its role in James Joyce's short story The Dead, it has been allowed to fall into decay. Similarly, the Regency gothic interiors, including magnificent plasterwork ceilings, in the Church of St. Michael and St. John beside the civic offices on the quays were taken out without recourse to any regulation or law. This was to make room for a museum featuring Viking relics and some thatched Viking cottages. While neglect and chauvinism were once the main enemies of preserving heritage, the danger now comes from unrelenting commercial pressure, an unnecessary side effect of our recently acquired prosperity. Vigilance is required to preserve a building which misplaced development can destroy forever. Eternal vigilance is the price we must pay to preserve our heritage. In Dublin the external fabric of Merrion and Fitzwilliam Squares remains intact. Every house on both squares is listed for preservation in the Dublin city development plan, list 1. Unfortunately, this listing does not encompass the interiors. The separate listing for interior, list, 4, deals with the interior features of buildings. Incredibly, interiors of only four houses on Merrion Square are on list 4 and no houses in Fitzwilliam Square are on it. [1268] This means that our Georgian squares, a vast wealth of historical detail and an internationally recognised image of our capital city, are vulnerable to crass and poorly planned development. A great deal of damage has already been done. In 54 Fitzwilliam Square, for example, the internal walls and stairs at second and third floor levels were removed and replaced with open plan offices and a spiral staircase. This legislation would prevent this all too frequent occurrence. The Government needs to take a number of actions simultaneously. First, it must ensure there is adequate legal provision for historic buildings, their interiors and surrounds. This Bill achieves that objective. Second, there must be provision for an integrated regime of tax incentives to secure a general change of use of historic houses from offices and bedsits to family homes. Fianna Fáil recently published a policy paper outlining how this can be done. Third, the Government, as the biggest landlord of historic buildings, should lead by example. Historic buildings in Government ownership are usually in offices, closed to the public and furnished in a way that is oblivious of the buildings' historical features. Recently I tabled a number of questions to Ministers about historic buildings used by Government Departments. It was amazing to find out how many are not open to the public. The Government could make more of these historic buildings accessible to the public. Among the properties in the ownership of the State are 21 and 31 Fitzwilliam Square and 5, 6A, 16, 44, 45, 73, 88 and 89 Merrion Square. Is it any wonder that the light goes out of Georgian Dublin at 6 p. m. every evening? If the Government is serious about preserving our heritage it must develop a co-ordinated policy for its property portfolio. The best hope for the long-term preservation of Georgian houses is reconversion to family homes with, where desirable, a limited element of mixed usage. Fianna Fáil, as it has clearly set out in its policy document for Georgian Dublin, is committed to doing this. [1269] This Bill seeks not only to protect the building and its interiors but also its curtilage. I welcome this. Intrinsic to a building is its surrounds. A great deal of bungled building on historic grounds might be prevented if this measure is enacted. However, I am concerned that the term 'curtilage' might not be sufficinetly defined and might not be sufficiently wide. An architectural encyclopaedia I consulted defined curtilage as 'the grounds adjacent to a dwelling and appertaining to a yard, garden or court'. Would this be sufficient to prevent the proposed building of houses on the mall approaching Carton House from Maynooth, for example? The mall, strictly speaking, might not be part of the curtilage of Carton House. It is, however, absolutely intrinsic to the integrity of the building. This issue should be looked at on Committee Stage with a view to strengthening the provision. The Bill also highlights the need for authorities to have trained and qualified personnel to deal with historic buildings. Local authorities, in particular, have much responsibility for the preservation of historic buildings. However, they seldom have the resources they require to carry out these duties properly. If the Government is serious about preserving our built heritage, it must act through a broad range of measures. Good intentions and ad hoc actions did nothing to stop 15 Usher's Quay from falling into disrepair. Can we wonder that James Joyce chose silence, exile and cunning as his weapons? Up to today the inter-governmental working group's report on listed buildings has not been published. The Government has put this issue on the long finger since it came into office. We are continually lectured on the importance of our heritage but the Government is not supporting its talk with action. The Opposition parties, on the other hand, have published policy papers and legislation. There is no shortage of suggested remedies. What has been conspicuously lacking to date is the will to act. [1270] It is strange that the interdepartmental working group's report is available to Government Ministers but is not before the House tonight. If the Government was really interested in this subject it would have made the report available as it would have added greatly to this debate. There is a huge amount of information in it which Members could have used. We are continually told the report will be released and, as the Ministers already have it, I cannot understand why it has not been made available to Members. No political debate about the future of our built heritage should be completed without paying tribute to the voluntary organisations and concerned individuals who campaigned tirelessly to ensure that our built heritage passed on intact. All political parties should face the fact that we were latecomers to the idea of historical preservation. Together with the general population, we have only gradually realised the damage we have done to our heritage by neglect and poor development. Future generations owe a debt of gratitude to the foresight of a small number of individuals who fought to highlight the importance of our historic buildings and the danger that faces them. That danger is ever present. This Bill will be a useful measure in ensuring that the present situation is improved. The Minister of State said that conservation for conservation's sake is not enough and that if these buildings are to be preserved new uses will have to be found for them. If tax incentives are provided and there is the right attitude, the market will look after the rest. A few years ago nobody would have thought that Temple Bar would contain children's theatres and breweries. The market takes care of such developments.",25/06/1996,27,16,17,I thank my colleague Deputy de Valera for sharing her time On behalf of the,Fianna Fáil,Party I welcome and support the Bill and congratulate Deputy Quill on bringing it forward It is obvious the Deputy,Fianna Fáil,2847186_1,,I thank my colleague Deputy de Valera for sharing her time On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I welcome and support the Bill and congratulate Deputy Quill on bringing it forward It is obvious the Deputy,I thank my colleague Deputy de Valera for sharing her time On behalf of the Party I welcome and support the Bill and congratulate Deputy Quill on bringing it forward It is obvious the Deputy,text391,0,7,0,0,35,0.2,7,2.708050201,0.077372863,0.439480212,0.012556577,0.991991992,0.998998999,1,0.973973974,0.943943944,0.921921922,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2478765,991,8,137,"Private Members' Business. - Finance Bill, 1990: Report Stage (Resumed).",23/05/1990,Mr. Albert Reynolds,Fianna Fáil,Longford -Westmeath,"Deputy Taylor's amendment proposes tax relief on donations to charities which provide development aid or emergency relief in developing countries. I am sure all Deputies will join me in paying tribute to the tremendous work done by such charities. As Deputies will be aware, the income of those charities, whether from donations or otherwise, is exempt from taxation in their hands as [269] long as that income is applied for charitable purposes. However, to go further, as Deputy Taylor suggests, and allow relief to persons who make donations to such charities would mean that the Exchequer would find itself funding, at anything up to 53 per cent, organisations which currently operate on voluntary and unrelieved contributions. This cost, which could be substantial, depending on the extent to which use was made of the relief by both existing and new subscribers, would be additional to the State's contribution to development assistance which is over £34 million. The cost of implementing the proposal in the amendment could not be afforded within the present budgetary constraints and, if conceded, would have to be made up from elsewhere. Everybody will agree that our current levels of tax are too high. Therefore, I am very reluctant to seek more revenue from any source to make up such deficiency. In all the circumstances I am sure the House will appreciate that I am not in a position to concede the tax reliefs sought by Deputy Taylor.",23/05/1990,26,78,79,taxation in their hands as 269 long as that income is applied for charitable purposes However to go further as,Deputy Taylor,suggests and allow relief to persons who make donations to such charities would mean that the Exchequer would find itself,Deputy Taylor,2478765_1,,taxation in their hands as 269 long as that income is applied for charitable purposes However to go further as Deputy Taylor suggests and allow relief to persons who make donations to such charities would mean that the Exchequer would find itself,taxation in their hands as 269 long as that income is applied for charitable purposes However to go further as suggests and allow relief to persons who make donations to such charities would mean that the Exchequer would find itself,text489,0,3,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.945910149,0.048647754,0.120176179,0.003004404,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.937937938,0.884884885,0.624624625,0.595595596,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2307995,535,14,181,Health Policy: Statements.,21/05/1987,Mr. Brendan Howlin,The Labour Party,Wexford,"I voted against the budget that proposed those cuts. The Labour Party withdrew from the Coalition Government when Fine Gael proposed similar measures. The Progressive Democrats subscribed to the overall Estimate and in the course of their motion debated this week stated: 'That Dáil [2667] Éireann, wishing to remain within the 1987 revised Estimates for Health...'. Last night Fine Gael stated that they wished to remain within the 1987 revised Estimates for Health. That is the kernel of it. We can hide behind local issues and gyrate and indulge in all sorts of humbug but the reality is that the net Exchequer allocation to the health services has been reduced. The provisional outturn for last year was £1,117 million. The Fine Gael alternative budget, rejected in the first instance by the Labour Party and then by the people, was to provide £1,115 million for this year. The Fianna Fáil solution and budget provision, having gone to the people on the basis that health cuts hurt the old and the sick, a national scandal and an unprecedented con job, was to provide £1,111 million, a decrease below even the Fine Gael miserable allocation. In order to maintain services at even the level of last year, an increase of at least 3½ per cent over the £1,117 million spent on the health services last year would be required. However, roughly £35 million have been lopped off with the consequent loss of 3,500 jobs. This has obviously led to closures of hospitals because there is not enough staff to provide the service. I listed last night every single area of operation that has been adversely affected. Transport has been reduced to cater for emergencies only. Acute hospital wards have been closed in every single instance. Five support hospitals are gone in the south east and at least 20 more are gone throughout the country. The community care budget has been slashed leaving no opthalmic and dental benefits. If the Minister is so convinced that his policy is correct, let him at least recognise what is happening on the ground and recognise the confusion and anger his policies on the health services are causing. An area highlighted in a recent RTE programme was in relation to child sexual abuse which has become a grave and serious problem, a problem with which every member would be concerned. The only child psychiatric service in Munster is provided at St. Stephen's Hospital in [2668] Cork. This unit has assessed and treated 598 children on an in-patient basis since it was opened in February, 1987. They have treated children suffering from sexual abuse, physical abuse and children who are emotionally disturbed. Some of these children are there under 'unfit persons' orders or 'place of safety' orders from the courts. There is no place else for them to go and yet that unit is being closed down. The out-patients' department in the same unit is treating some 250 cases. The Minister's public assertion that it is his ambition to ensure that nobody will be left without an adequate health service, is patent nonsense, given the situation which exists. I listened with rising anger to the PD spokesperson, Deputy Wyse, whose only solution to the health crisis is to talk in terms of reducing the bureaucracy. The Deputy said he would save £150,000 here, and another £150,000 there, but that is only peanuts in the overall context. The Deputy was only providing a useful smokescreen for the Progressive Democrats to screen their fundamental support for this policy of cutting public expenditure, a policy which they put before the people but the logical consequences of which they are afraid to address. Similarly the Fine Gael proposal accepting the strategy but refusing to accept the downstream consequences is a smokescreen. We have raised repeatedly the issue of private medicine. Applications are coming in in increasing numbers for extensions to the Blackrock clinic and all the private hospitals around the country. Deputy Wyse now wants to privatise care for the elderly. The UK experience surely indicates that we have enough grotty private homes which are inadequately monitored into which to dump old people. What we want is a proper public service available to those who need it regardless of ability to pay. The Government have tried to smokescreen the whole issue with all sorts of gyrations over public spending. Deputy Desmond last night indicated the supplementary budgets that were brought in by Fianna Fáil Ministers year after year and indicated that when [2669] he came into the Department he refused to allow those supplementary estimates and insisted that the Fianna Fáil controlled health boards would live within their budgets. The health boards overspent and had yearly rows with Deputy Desmond as Minister and Deputy Desmond had to meet deputations supported by Fianna Fáil members of this House demanding more and more money. This has been an unprecedented U-turn by the Government. We have a crisis in the hospital health service and it can only be solved by providing resources. We can get those resources by restoring a land tax, by beginning to tax capital, by beginning to collect the VAT outstanding, some £700 million, by beginning to collect health levies due from the self employed——",21/05/1987,25,121,122,"net Exchequer allocation to the health services has been reduced The provisional outturn for last year was 1,117 million The",Fine Gael,"alternative budget rejected in the first instance by the Labour Party and then by the people was to provide 1,115",Fine Gael,2307995_5,,"net Exchequer allocation to the health services has been reduced The provisional outturn for last year was 1,117 million The Fine Gael alternative budget rejected in the first instance by the Labour Party and then by the people was to provide 1,115","net Exchequer allocation to the health services has been reduced The provisional outturn for last year was 1,117 million The alternative budget rejected in the first instance by the Labour Party and then by the people was to provide 1,115",text772,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.032444284,-0.000811107,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.302302302,0.304304304,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1630524,402,9,92,"Financial Statement, 1974: Motion (Resumed).",24/04/1974,Mr. Garret FitzGerald,Fine Gael,Dublin South-East,"This is only my second time to contribute to a budget debate. I am reminded now of the position a year ago when the Minister for Finance sat opposite me and interrupted me on many occasions. On any occasion I made reference to income tax, and there were many relevant points I made to him in this regard, the Minister interrupted [139] me. At that time I felt the Minister was like a schoolboy who thought he had all the answers but was disappointed when a Member could point out faults to him or where there was room for improvement. I hope that in the past year the Minister has come to realise that he does not know all the answers, that, in fact, he has very few answers. The two speakers I have heard from the Government side of the House tonight have proved to me beyond all doubt how dissatisfied their supporters are with this budget and I am convinced that their supporters conveyed this dissatisfaction to them during the recess. Immediately after the Minister introduced his budget we had some of the power and might of the Government speaking, some of these strong men in the Cabinet. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, among others, made long contributions but with very little content. The Minister for Industry and Commerce devoted his time to attacking the Opposition. Tonight the contributions from the Government side were pathetically weak in trying to pick the good points in this budget. It was clear from their contributions that they do not believe it is a good budget. Deputy Governey referred to social welfare benefits and to what had been achieved for social welfare recipients. One would think, listening to him and to other speakers from the Government side, that only one group of people were interested in the social welfare recipients. I have as much right to speak for the lower income groups and the under-privileged classes as anybody on that side of the House. There are members of the Labour Party who would give one the impression that they are the only people interested in the welfare of these people. That is far from the truth. The party of which I am proud to be a member were the party who first showed what a social conscience was. They were the party who first have the people status and money. I [140] agree that enough was not done, nor is enough being done now. However, there is a vast difference between what we have done and the efforts of the present Government. The two speakers I have heard tonight have said the Government have given extensive increases in social welfare benefits. Deputy O'Brien, who is not now present, said more was given in the last two budgets than in the previous eight years. The Deputy might be asked why more was given in the last two budgets. The reason is simply that more money was available because of our accession to the EEC. The Minister opposite me knows he campaigned against our entry. Had his party's campaign been successful, the Minister for Finance would not have that kind of money to give to the poorest sections. It is thanks to Fianna Fáil that this money is available, to the campaign led by Fianna Fáil which was supported in a half-hearted way by most of the Fine Gael Party, although there were some exceptions. At that time it was made clear that this money would be available to the social welfare recipients. If money was provided to give to the poorer sections of the community that alone was worth our entering Europe. I am glad that some new schemes were introduced. I am always interested in the welfare of the people and any move by any Government to alleviate poverty and to improve the lot of people will have my unreserved support. However, the kudos being given to the Minister for Finance or to the present team on the front bench—the excellent team, as Deputy Governey calls them—is due to the extra money now available. Deputy Governey represents a rural constituency and I am surprised he is not aware that no longer will the huge agricultural subsidies be provided which had to be provided in former years. Later I shall explain to him and to others why I think this budget bears no relation to the budgets the people knew up to a short time ago. There are many reasons for the change. The increases in the social welfare benefits are still not sufficient. On the [141] Minister's own admission, they are still only slightly ahead of the inflation growth. I accept any figure given by a Minister as a conservative one and I think the social welfare increases will not keep in line with the growing rate of inflation and with the huge price increases since the budget. I wish to repeat that Fianna Fáil were the party who always had a social conscience. They will support any improvements that are given to those in need and I wish to put that on the record of this House. In recent times I have seen the Minister for Finance under severe strain at Question Time. I hope the worry and frustration, and possibly the disappointments he is meeting— which the people of the country have to face—are not upsetting him to the extent that he shows this sign of strain. Perhaps it is due to the tug-of-war that goes on between the two parties in the Government. At times I wonder if he is like the cord tied around the tug-of-war rope, being pulled back and forth across the centre point. This may be the reason for his frustration. If this is so, we may be facing a situation that, unfortunately, was faced by the Government in the early fifties and in the terrible years of the last Coalition Government from 1954 to 1957 which many of us, as young people, remember too well. In the opening sentence in his statement, the Minister said the success of last year's budget policy was responsible for the growth rate. It is generally accepted that, for the most part, the growth rate last year took place in the first half of the year. What impact could the budget have had at that time? It would have been a very minor one. The growth rate can be laid on the shoulders of the solid Government who went before them. Let him give credit where it is due. The foundation for the growth rate was laid by the Fianna Fáil Government and it was further helped by our entry into the EEC and the opening of the European markets to us. Naturally it gave a great incentive to industrialists to come here, to set up shop and to provide more jobs. Again, one of the parties in the Government [142] campaigned solidly against entry into the EEC. For my part I shall always be in favour of industry where it provides more jobs and opportunities for our people. It annoys me to hear members of the Labour Party making statements in this House because one would think they were the only people who represent the workers. I am proud to say I was always a worker, and I shall always look forward to representing them and to speaking on their behalf. The tug-of-war to which I have referred is becoming more clear as the weeks go by. We have seen it on a number of occasions on the wealth tax issue. I think it was the Minister present who claimed in a recent radio interview that this was one of their achievements in government. However, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has said it is a White Paper that must be discussed, that representations may be made and that at this stage it is not law or something the Government will introduce. We had a Fine Gael Deputy who said the wealth tax will be even higher than it is in the White Paper. It is difficult to know who is winning the tug-of-war——",24/04/1974,20,685,686,kudos being given to the Minister for Finance or to the present team on the front bench-the excellent team as,Deputy Governey,calls them-is due to the extra money now available Deputy Governey represents a rural constituency and I am surprised he,Deputy Governey,1630524_5,,kudos being given to the Minister for Finance or to the present team on the front bench-the excellent team as Deputy Governey calls them-is due to the extra money now available Deputy Governey represents a rural constituency and I am surprised he,kudos being given to the Minister for Finance or to the present team on the front bench-the excellent team as calls them-is due to the extra money now available Deputy Governey represents a rural constituency and I am surprised he,text277,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.624928567,0.015623214,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.987987988,0.951951952,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1134541,68,8,98,Committee on Finance. - Vote 47—External Affairs.,03/04/1963,Mr. Lionel O. Booth,Fianna Fáil,Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown,"I should, first of all, like to deal with a few points raised by previous speakers. I am glad that Deputy Corish referred to Partition, as did Deputy Cosgrave. This is a question which properly arises on this Estimate but one which is fraught with tremendous difficulties. First of all, we must realise that the Government of Northern Ireland is not an independent Government in the strict sense of the word, and that it has no power to conduct external relations of any type. It must work only through the British Government in Westminster and we must not feel therefore, that every time we make an offer of co-operation to that Government and it is not immediately accepted, it is an action of pure malice on the part of the Northern Ireland Government. In many cases, the Northern Ireland [991] Government are not able and are not authorised to take any action directly with us. The whole position is very vague and very confused and in actual fact, we do have relations with each other. I am glad to say that these contacts appear to be getting closer and I hope more productive. When Deputy Corish was speaking about his passionate desire to see greater unity in the country, he committed what, to my mind, is the cardinal sin, unintentionally, of being downright offensive to the people of Northern Ireland. We always feel offended when people from the north mispronounce the word 'Dáil' or the word 'Taoiseach' and we feel they are doing it out of sheer badness. It is exactly the same when public men, or even ordinary citizens in private conversation, insist on referring to that territory as the 'Six Counties'. To be perfectly frank, I do not care twopence whether there is a formal recognition of that Government but at least we should try to behave ourselves in such a way as not to create offence unnecessarily but Deputy Corish, like many others, did so. Even when referring to the new Prime Minister, Captain O'Neill, he referred to him as 'Captain O'Neill, the new Prime Minister, or whatever he calls himself'. That is a slighting reference and I was very sorry that a person like Deputy Corish should do that. I do not think it was done intentionally. I think it was a mistake but it was a tragic mistake. It cannot be said to be a complimentary remark. I think a considerable responsibility rests upon the Government to build up a closer contact than exists at present but the responsibility does not rest solely upon the Government. As I have said before in this House, a very heavy load of responsibility rests on the ordinary citizens. A positively frighteningly high proportion of our people regard anywhere north of Skerries as practically foreign territory. They may get up as far as Drogheda or even Dundalk but to many of our people these are strange cities quite unknown to them and as for crossing into Newry or getting as far as Belfast, the idea just never occurs to our people at all. [992] Northerners come south but we very rarely go north. Yet we sit here and pontificate about Northern Ireland as if we knew what we were talking about and in 99 cases out of 100, we do not. It is time that we all took this matter seriously to heart and, as a matter of policy, went up north far more often, whether on business, on holidays or just for the fun of it, to try to see what it is like, what its problems are, what its people are thinking about, how their minds work. If we could have much more interchange on that level, we would do a great deal better. Deputy Corish also referred to this question of neutrality and described it as our traditional neutrality. That is a conception which I cannot accept at all. I do not know how the idea got around that Ireland was traditionally neutral and I do not know that anybody felt that our neutrality in the last war was something of which we were to be essentially proud. It was an essential policy and the only policy which could be followed in those circumstances but I never heard anybody boasting of it or saw anybody patting himself on the back about it. You do not pat yourself on the back for being neutral, any more than you pat yourself on the back for being belligerent. The fact was that in 1939 hostilities broke out in Europe and we had to adopt some attitude to these hostilities, either to join or to remain outside and our choice, for various good historical reasons and for political reasons at the time, was absolutely right. With practically unanimity, it was decided that we would remain neutral in that conflict but that was not a decision for all time it was a decision in one particular set of circumstances. The war eventually ended, but the war mentality remained and most of the world remained divided into the belligerents and non-belligerents. The name normally given to the non-belligerents was 'neutrals' and consequently we continued to regard ourselves as neutral and to be so regarded by others. But there was no clear definition of the word 'neutrality' and there was a great deal of woolly thinking about what the word meant. [993] In fact, we took every possible opportunity of getting back into the stream of international thought and action. We were one of the founder members of the Council of Europe and would have been a member of the United Nations at a very much earlier date if our application for membership had not been blocked by Soviet Russia. That was not the action of a country with a tradition of neutrality. I would hope, therefore, that we would try to forget what So-and-So said on this occasion, unless we remember at the same time the circumstances in which that remark was made. A phrase—a speech even— taken out of its historical context can be used as a means or drawing an entirely incorrect conclusion. Before the contribution of Deputy McQuillan, whose remarks we can treat with the most complete contempt because they were largely based on gross misquotations, we had Deputy Cosgrave. I am sorry that Deputy Cosgrave's speech was a rather colourless one but it was one to which one could not take any great exception. He referred to Partition in a rather vague way but then went on to dwell on the Fine Gael policy of expanding trade with Great Britain and relying on the British markets. I know the criticism is normally made of Fianna Fáil that there is division of opinion on many matters but the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave were very different from those of Deputy Costello. Deputy Cosgrave was quite obviously supporting a continuation of the British trade connection and almost a concentration on development of that market. Deputy Costello, however, was pointing out, more correctly, as would appear to this side of the House, that our economic dependence on the British market for our agricultural exports has been one of the greatest handicaps from which this country has suffered for many years and that membership of the European Economic Community would have enabled us to break out of that unfortunate tie-up. Deputy Cosgrave also mentioned the booklet to which the Minister referred in his introductory speech. There is [994] one point on that about which I should like information from the Minister. In how many languages is this booklet to be printed? I would hope that it would not go out purely in English. In the magazine Development, which is a private venture, published here, I notice with delight how often French or German is used in the publication and in the advertisements. In our publicity, we must be very careful as much as possible to put our propaganda across in the languages of the countries which we wish to influence. We tend to fall into the British error of feeling that anyone who is worth knowing knows English or, if he does not, should learn it. I would hope, therefore, that this booklet will be very well produced and will be published in at least two other European languages. Deputy Costello made a rather petulent speech and I got the impression right from the start that he was not able readily to convince even himself. It is a very common reaction that when one is doubtful about a point, one tends to shout very loud. Deputy Costello referred to the idle boasts and posturings of the Government in connection with our application for membership of the EEC and stated it was quite untrue that our application was not conditional on the British application. Quite obviously, there is a connection in some way but it never was a condition and it is quite incorrect to say that we were never keen on the Common Market until Great Britain appeared to be trying to get in also. It is a fact that Irish influence has always been asserted to try to further the cause of European unity and that we were doing all we could in the negotiations before the Treaty of Rome was signed to try to hold Europe together. We were fully prepared at that time to take our place in a new European community. When those negotiations broke down and Great Britain pulled out, or in fact was put out, again through French pressure, our position was that we were not then yet ready to make an application on our own. Deputy Costello stated that there had been a radical and very satisfactory change of Fianna Fáil policy since the question of our EEC application came [995] up. This of course is entirely untrue and there is no foundation for it whatever. We have always been trying on this side of the House as, I think, has been the case all round the House, to encourage all measures for European unity. He went on then to refer to the failure of our application. I hope it is not because I am an incurable optimist, but I deny absolutely that our application has failed or that it has been rejected. Negotiations on our application have been suspended and that is as far as it goes. It has been accepted in principle as a basis for negotiation, but owing to circumstances outside our control, the negotiations are suspended. Therefore, anyone who refers to the failure of our negotiations or the complete collapse of efforts to enlarge the Community is doing a great disservice to the cause of European unity. We must at all costs keep our spirits up and keep the spirits up of others as well because this temporary setback has injured many, if not all, of the countries in the Community almost, if not entirely, as much as ourselves. Everybody has been shaken by it to some extent and we must not say there has been a final failure. I do not think we are fooling ourselves when we deny there is a final failure. There has been a temporary setback and nothing more. Deputy Costello also referred to our isolation from the European Free Trade Area. The Deputy knows perfectly well that EFTA offered nothing to us whatsoever and that membership of it would have placed us in fact in an even more difficult position than the reverse. In any case — it is easier for a backbencher to say this than a Minister — I believe EFTA was a bluff right from the start, nothing more than a counterblast to the obvious success of the European Economic Community. It suffered from the great weakness that it was based purely on economic grounds and there is no real future for a community based on economics alone. I think, therefore, we were just as well off to keep out of EFTA and keep going with our [996] application for admission to the Community. He commented adversely on the fact that the Minister had not dealt with the question of the Community at all. I can well understand, or at least imagine a very good reason, why the Minister did not involve himself in this and I think it is worth while to try to see the situation as it stands at the moment. As I said before, a very severe blow has been struck at the whole structure of the Community by reason of the French rejection of the British application. We can all get annoyed with the French President — most of us have done so — but here again I think we must be patient and try to be understanding at the same time. We have only to cast our minds back a very short time to remember that France at that time was still suffering from severe military reverses in IndoChina, was heavily involved with military operations in Algeria and a very ticklish political situation there, that this affected not merely her affairs outside metropolitan France but was splitting the whole country inside as well. We had a situation where ordinary parliamentary government through the operation of political parties had been proved to be a failure, when Governments were collapsing and when in fact parliamentary government was becoming impossible. We had, in fact, a situation where mobilisation of civilians had to be called in Paris in order to resist a possible invasion of the capital city by a mutinous army from Algeria. That was a very difficult and dangerous situation. A great country was obviously showing signs of complete disintegration, and at that time only one man could be found who could rally the country around him. De Gaulle did precisely that. He had to take action which in many cases was unpopular and which outside was regarded as dangerous, but the fact remains that de Gaulle did get France back on the road again but only by playing up the great traditional role of France in Europe as the leader in culture, in military affairs, in economics and everything else. [997] He had to put forward a grandiose policy. He did so and he has got away with it. It has naturally made him a man who is very hard to live with. We have got to put up with it for the moment: we have got to be sympathetic with a country that has had such great difficulties. We must wait until the situation becomes more stable again, as it undoubtedly will, unless people lose patience and start being offensive or aggressive. We have to remember, too, that in Europe we have had this age old conflict and suspicion between France and Germany. We have had the aging Dr. Adenauer trying, as his last closing act before his career is ended, to reach a dramatic reconciliation with France. This treaty of mutual friendship was concluded just before the temporary collapse of the EEC negotiations. Many people felt Dr. Adenauer could have exercised greater influence on General de Gaulle than he did but here again we must be sympathetic with an old man who has a very long-cherished ambition which he sees practically within his grasp. Was he, at that stage, to risk falling out with the leader of the French nation over a temporary setback, even though that setback was something of which he himself greatly disapproved? We must forgive him if he did not do what many of us would have liked him to do. I feel our policy at this stage is one of almost ignoring the temporary setback in Brussels and proceeding as if things had been brought to a triumphant conclusion already. That is precisely what the Government are doing. Warnings have been given very clearly that the dismantling of our trade barriers must proceed with exactly the same urgency as if our application had already been accepted, on the clear understanding that we earnestly hope that the negotiations will be reopened at a comparatively early date and that, when that happens, we shall not have got completely out of line with countries that have also been reducing their trade barriers. There is no change of policy in that regard but I think in this rather difficult situation, any statement which the [998] Minister might make as representative of the Government might be misinterpreted. My remarks can be very safely ignored but I think the Minister would be very wise not to involve himself in a discussion of our EEC prospects because it is hard to do that without some expressions of regret or even recrimination at the fact that the negotiations have not already been completed. The Minister dealt very extensively with the work of the Council of Europe and I think he did so very properly because there we can still exert considerable influence and gain a tremendous amount of experience of what membership of a European community would entail. Anybody who has been to Strasbourg and is asked by someone having no knowledge of it at all: 'What does it all mean?', finds it very difficult to give a concise answer. The only answer you can give is: 'Go out there and see for yourself. Get the atmosphere of the place.' It is very difficult to say exactly what goes on, what makes it so exciting and, at times, so frustrating. But our representatives there have done an extremely good job and I should hope that this year, in particular, if possible, there should be no change in our delegation because the delegation appointed last year has soldiered through the period of the Brussels negotiations, has seen something of the agony which that has caused in Europe and will be all the better able to pick up some of the broken bits and carry on next year. I should hope that all political Parties would nominate the same representatives for next year. In that way we would get greater continuity and also we would show the other Europeans that we were taking the job really seriously. Generally speaking, the matter of publicity for Ireland was never of greater importance and one of the best ways of getting good publicity is by showing the country in a really hospitable light to prominent people who come here. I know there are outside this House those who feel that the amount spent on official entertainment is far too large. On the contrary, I [999] feel we do not spend half enough on it. I was very sorry to see that in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts last year adverse comment was made on expenditure on entertainment. This comment was completely unjustified by the evidence placed before the Committee and I am very sorry that, although I am a member of the Committee, I was away on holidays when the actual report was accepted. We are not spending half enough on entertainment. It is not unlike advertising in business. People say there is a lot of money wasted on advertising. If so, it is incredible that so many people in business should be willing to waste money in that way. All of us in business cannot be fools and the fact remains that if you do not advertise your products, you do not get business. Any other country is prepared to spend vast sums on entertainment. Some of us here have had experience of it at the receiving end. Two years ago, I was in Germany with the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy J. A. Costello and Deputy P. Brady for 12 days and no trouble or expense was spared for those 12 days. Typical of the way the German Government viewed the situation was this occurrence. One night while in our hotel in Bonn, a group of students or teachers from Nigeria came into the hotel and the official of the Bundestag who was conducting us around spotted them. I said to him: 'Do you know anything about that group?' He said: 'No, but I shall find out now.' He spoke to the leader of the group of about 35 and he came back about a quarter of an hour later quite clearly having been considerably shaken. He said: 'You will not believe what that group were up to.' He then said that they had come from Nigeria up through North Africa, across the Mediterranean into Greece and Turkey and into Russia. Then they told him that they had been to 'Free Germany' and had now come to see what 'occupied Germany' was like. That German official certainly did not lose any time. Inside 20 minutes, he had got in touch with his office and [1000] had got officials to start mapping out a complete tour at Government expense for this group of Nigerians. Their hotel bookings were to be made. The following morning a large bus awaited them outside the hotel to take them on a tour of the Federal Republic. That would cost the German Government a lot of money but they felt it was worth while. How right they were! In a matter of minutes, a tour lasting about a fortnight was arranged for 35 foreigners without any question of the expense. The money was there for entertaining foreign visitors. We could do much in that way. When committees of the Council of Europe are brought here, I am delighted because so often in the Council of Europe, we have found, as the Minister states, the reputation which Ireland has abroad, and even in Europe, is based upon complete fantasy. We need to show these fellow-Europeans of ours that we are not a dying community of peasants but that there is a dynamic community here that is going places, that is worthy of interest and that represents a good place in which to invest one's money. In that connection, therefore, I feel that the provision for entertainment is, if anything, on the low side. I would hope there will be no queries about it in future. On the question of the United Nations, we have had some intervention by various people. Deputy Costello was obviously terribly disappointed by the fact that when the vote was taken on the admission of Communist China to the United Nations, the Irish vote was given against it. What a pity: I can quite see his disappointment because he has been preaching so long that the vote would go the other way. It only proves that we were right all along and that we were not fooling anyone when we said we would fight to the end to get this matter placed upon the agenda and fully discussed. Fine Gael, in particular, kept jeering at us and saying in effect: 'You are Communists at heart. You want them in. You are going to vote them in and you are terrible people.'",03/04/1963,17,1142,1143,division of opinion on many matters but the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave were very different from those of Deputy Costello,Deputy Cosgrave,was quite obviously supporting a continuation of the British trade connection and almost a concentration on development of that market,Deputy Cosgrave,1134541_12,,division of opinion on many matters but the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave were very different from those of Deputy Costello Deputy Cosgrave was quite obviously supporting a continuation of the British trade connection and almost a concentration on development of that market,division of opinion on many matters but the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave were very different from those of Deputy Costello was quite obviously supporting a continuation of the British trade connection and almost a concentration on development of that market,text403,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.213453742,0.005336344,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.772772773,0.718718719,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2119556,44,14,139,"Financial Resolutions, 1984. - Financial Resolution No. 11: General (Resumed).",01/02/1984,Mr. Michael Bell,The Labour Party,Louth,"I had referred last evening to the contribution by the Minister for Labour in relation to the enterprise allowance scheme and his proposal to introduce legislation in relation to equality, with particular emphasis on equality for women. I also spoke about the enterprise allowance scheme with regard to getting people into productive employment — in other words, paying them for working rather than being on the dole doing nothing. Certainly the enterprise allowance scheme will make a great contribution in this regard. I also made the point that on this occasion, as against this time last year, Labour Party Ministers had made a substantially greater contribution to at least moving toward what I would see as being Labour Party policy and I congratulate them on having done so. I welcomed the decision of the Government not to apply VAT to footwear in view of the fact that that industry is one of the largest in my constituency, indeed one of our most important native industries. Not being too happy with the application of VAT to clothing I made a very strong point in this regard to my colleagues in Government. Its application, as announced in the budget, will not be very practical. I do not think it will succeed. I think it will create more problems than it will resolve. It may resolve some financial problems, but the system, as outlined in the budget, will create major problems of administration, manufacturing, retail and wholesale level. If it was necessary to apply VAT on clothing it would, as the lesser of two evils, have been better to apply it uniformly on all clothing. I do not think that excluding one section of the industry will benefit employment, the consumer or the Exchequer. As a trade unionist, I want to refer to unemployment. We are all aware of the [1399] problem and all parties are united in agreeing that unemployment is the greatest issue facing us today. I do not see any major strides being made towards relieving that situation in the budget, but there are some concessions which will obviously be of help. With regard to my own Border constituency, on a number of occasions I made a strong case to the Minister for Finance and other Ministers who have responsibility in financial areas, and I am glad that Deputy Moynihan is here this morning because he must be aware of the problems in the tourist industry as he comes from a major tourist area. We were pleased last year when VAT in the hotel industry was reduced from 23 per cent to 18 per cent. However, even that does not really help in the Border areas because of the price differential. There is still too great an incentive for people to flock across the Border in their thousands. It is estimated that about £40 million was lost to the Republic in the Newry area in a six month period last year. This is a frightening figure, although I appreciate that our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland had to cope with the same situation when the position was reversed. Our policy should be designed in such a way that the differential will not be as great as it is now. There is no point in saying that we will improve surveillance on the Border and provide more customs and excise officers. That will not work, because it is well known that you cannot physically stem the tide of people crossing in their thousands, especially at weekends. Whilst the price increases on a number of items have been much smaller than in previous budgets, they do very little, if anything, to solve the problems. Therefore, the Border area must be singled out for special consideration, because there is a difference between the competitiveness of Cork and Kerry, Newry and Dundalk or Clones and its neighbouring towns on the other side of the Border. A Cheann Comhairle, as a Deputy in a Border area you will appreciate what is happening there. We will be faced with mass unemployment growing on a daily basis [1400] in garages, supermarkets, shops and all the service industries that provide employment in Dundalk, Drogheda, Ardee and Carrickmacross. If we cannot get concessions in the budget what should we get? I have already spoken to the Minister for the Environment in relation to the natural gas pipeline, which I hope will go ahead without further delay so that we will be able to utilise this very valuable natural resource to attract alternative employment in Border areas. It took quite a lengthy period to resolve the differences and to reach agreement on prices with Northern Ireland. I hope it will not take as long for An Bord Gáis to proceed with this pipeline through County Louth, via Drogheda and Dundalk, which are the two major industrial towns in the Border area, and that the natural gas pipeline will have links which will service towns like Ardee, Carrickmacross, Cavan and Monaghan. This is the only opportunity we have to attract alternative employment, but it will only come if it is given to us at the best possible competitive price. There is no point in giving us natural gas as simply an alternative energy, as this will be no incentive to industries which are already operating there. All the large companies, Premier Periclase, Carroll's and the breweries, use a considerable amount of energy. Dundalk is still operating on town gas and would benefit greatly from the new gas if it is supplied at the right price and not in competition with Dublin Gas. Premier Periclase are one of the biggest users of energy in the State. They extract magnesium from sea water and would benefit more than most from natural gas. I am satisfied from the discussions which I had with the Minister for the Environment that he will use his influence and decision making function with An Bord Gáis to have this natural resource supplied to County Louth and the Border areas. There is no doubt that Irish industry is suffering greatly from the cost of energy. If the Government wished to develop employment, the key to doing so is in the cost of energy. It has been clearly established that we have the most expensive energy costs in Western Europe. I cannot [1401] understand why successive Governments have not been able to see that a cheap energy policy with regard to industry would substantially increase our job potential, secure existing jobs and attract foreign and home industry. Everybody agrees with this policy but no one does anything about it. The IDA have given the State very good service. It was easy to attract jobs when we were offering a package on a competitive basis which was unequalled in European terms. The Americans, Japanese and the British were flocking here to avail of the package we had to offer, especially companies located outside the EEC who wanted to get a foothold in the EEC market and inside the trade barriers. That no longer exists, and, therefore, it is necessary for the IDA to substantially change their direction. They have done that to some degree in relation to the development of small industries. We now agree that small is beautiful and that large companies, even multi-nationals, are in jeopardy. We have to concentrate on building up national industries. We have a clear example in Japan where over 85 per cent of industry is small and locally based. That policy has to be developed, but that can only be done successfully if the regional offices of the IDA operate on a more co-ordinated basis. Very often a young man who has been made redundant asks local representatives for advice on setting up a new industry. We tell him that the IDA, AnCO, the county development officers, YEA and so on can help him. We tell him where to go to get planning permission, to arrange water and sewage facilities and so on. It should not be necessary for elected representatives to do this. The IDA regional offices should be structured in such a way that all these services are brought under the one umbrella at regional level. If someone has an idea and a few pounds redundancy pay to start a new business, and all the necessary expertise, he should be able to get all the necessary help at local level because every town and village should have small ready-made industrial units to attract these young entrepreneurs. If the IDA examine the amount of imported goods [1402] in the engineering, industrial or commercial fields, they will find there are thousands of opportunities for young and not so young people to set up their own businesses, but they are discouraged from doing so because of the web of problems they find at every level. I came across such a case very recently where a young man had a very good idea to set up a new industry, which would employ three or four people, to produce an article which would replace an imported article. He spent six months putting all the pieces together after consulting with the IDA, AnCO, the county development officer, the local authority and so on. The structure of the IDA should be looked at: it should relate more to our natural resources, there should be more local offices and there should be more co-ordination locally. I would like to refer to the building industry. There are about 60,000 people unemployed in this industry. Small incentives were given to this industry in the budget, but not enough to justify a revival of the industry at national level. Co-ordination between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of the Environment on the following basis might be very helpful. The Labour Party are committed to setting up a national pay-related pension scheme. I was disappointed that this was not referred to in the budget but hopefully the Minister for Social Welfare will take that as a priority in the very near future. The funds from a national pay-related pension scheme could be invested in house building and the industrial building sector. In the same way as the new loan system under the housing finance scheme is attracting money from private sources, I believe a national pay-related pension scheme would generate millions of pounds which could be channelled into the building industry by way of house loans, incentives to builders, loans to State organisations — such as the IDA for the purpose of providing factory buildings — loans for badly needed school buildings, civil engineering works, sewage and water facilities and so on. New areas for seeking finance have to be found, and here is an area where money paid by [1403] workers could be channelled into productive work to create employment. Unemployment is the source of our present economic problems. The State has to carry too high a percentage of our non-working population. At present one-quarter of our total working population are drawing from State funds, whether by unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, old age pensions, widows and orphans allowances and so on. The social welfare burden has grown enormously because of unemployment. If we solve our unemployment problems we will not have the type of budget or balance of payments we had over the past two years. Unemployment is the source of all our problems. If the Government cannot see that they are not doing their job and if they are to do their job, they must resolve this problem immediately. I was pleased to see that there has been some relief of VAT on concrete products and stock relief. I hope this will help to stabilise the building and supply industry. I want to refer to the problems my colleagues and I have at local authority level and the disaster we had in County Louth trying to apply a £26 charge for services. Many of us forecast that this would not succeed, and we were proved right. It has not been possible to collect that money. If local authorities are to be reorganised, and if they are to charge for services, this will have to be done in an effective way. The rates relief grant from the Department of the Environment to local authorities is such that almost all local authorities will have to introduce new charges or increase existing ones. Last year it was not necessary to apply charges in Drogheda corporation and Dundalk Urban District Council because of good housekeeping by both authorities but, as mayor of Drogheda, I am not sure if that will be possible this year. I will have more to say about this when we discuss the estimates shortly. It appears that there will be a net deficit in relation to the amount of money applied to local authorities this year as against last year. We all accept that our problems were caused by the elimination of rates. We no longer [1404] have the money to run local authorities. Talking about unemployment, it is a shame that, while we are knocking off men right across the board at local authority level, in the craft sector, in the general sector and even in the professional sector, putting them onto unemployment benefit and paying them for doing nothing, at the same time we have not got enough men to repair potholes, or to repair windows, doors and roofs for old ladies. In some cases we pay people the same amount of money for doing nothing. This is degrading and nobody wants it. We have fully qualified, skilled men who could be employed by the local authorities, but they are queueing up to collect the dole on a weekly basis. There is no logic in that. It appears to those of us charged with the responsibility to run our local affairs that there is no co-ordination between Government Departments. The Department of Social Welfare have their allocation and do their own thing. The Department of the Environment have their allocation and do their own thing. There does not seem to be any attempt to transfer money from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of the Environment to take people off the dole and get them into productive employment in the building industry or wherever it may be. I find it difficult to understand the system. I do not know whether it is that Ministers cannot agree or civil servants cannot agree. There must be some disagreement at departmental level when millions of pounds are being spent on social welfare benefits while employees of local authorities are being knocked off and put on social welfare. On a businesslike basis the Government and most of the Departments would be out of business long ago. I should like to refer to people who are fortunate enough to be at work. Last year I had to vote against the Social Welfare Bill. I am glad we have nothing like that this year. Hopefully nobody will get a brain storm and introduce that type of legislation. It did not succeed in resolving any of our problems or in correcting any of the abuses. This time last year we had [1405] 13,000 people working a three day week and being paid for three days. Now we have approximately 2,000 people on a three day week. Rather than carrying people on a three day week employers have disemployed them, made them redundant, and put them on full-time unemployment. While they are on full-time unemployment they are making no contribution to the Exchequer. They are not paying PRSI. They are not paying unemployment benefit. They are not paying anything apart from the normal VAT and so on. At the same time the Department of Social Welfare are paying them for doing nothing. I warned that this would happen, and it has happened. It is unfortunate that Ministers are not getting the right advice. Those of us in industry could see what would happen, and it has happened. We now have 10,000 more people on the unemployment heap, drawing full-time social welfare and paying nothing into the system. Workers who are employed are paying more and more into the Exchequer from their earnings, to a degree where the incentive has been taken out of the workplace. I see nothing in the budget to restore that incentive. Naturally as a trade unionist I welcome the fact that 15,000 people will be taken out of the tax net. Last year I was shouted at by a number of people when I said old age pensioners with miserable pittances were paying tax while millionaires were getting away with substantial sums of money. Last night I heard the case of a man who lives in Drogheda. I will not mention his name. His retirement pension from the building industry is £13. 12 after working for over 30 years in the building industry. Believe it or not his tax was £8. 53. His net take home pension was £4. 59. This should be noted by those of us who are fortunate enough to have pensions, including those in the public service who operate the system. Last year people said what I was saying was untrue, but there is the proof of it. I do not know what is happening in this country of ours. This man contributed all his life to the system. He worked his guts out in all sorts of weather and conditions [1406] in the building industry. He gets a pension of £13 after 30 years. Why? Because most of the employers he worked for did not pay any contribution. Even though he paid his contribution it was not returned to the Exchequer. There is no machinery in the State to ensure that those contributions are returned. He has no State pension. He has no guaranteed pension. He has no pension given to him by the Oireachtas. He has to depend on his own miserable old age pension, plus £13. I spoke about this in the first contribution I made to the Dáil, and nothing has changed since. I want to send a clear message to my colleague, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare. He should introduce a national pay-related pension which will bring people working in the building industry and the factories into line with those sections of the community who are privileged, those people who have guaranteed pensions of two-thirds of their salary for administering the affairs of the State. What is the difference between those of us who are in a privileged position and those who have to earn the money to pay for the pensions of people with guaranteed State pensions of two-thirds of their pay? The public servants within the Departments should get off their backsides and put that case to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach. That would be doing a good job for the working classes. If we call ourselves socialists, or if we have a social conscience, we must realise where the maximum poverty arises: with old people and widows who have to exist on miserable pensions. We would not need a committee on poverty if every man and woman who retired from employment had a decent take home pension after working for a lifetime. You will excuse me, a Cheann Comhairle, but that is a subject which really gets me going. As long as I am here I will make this contribution at every available opportunity. I should like to refer very briefly to a number of areas where there is employment potential. Clogherhead is a fishing village not far from the town of Drogheda. They have a healthy and [1407] thriving industry there. They have been waiting ten years for a pier. They have been caught up in a web of bureaucracy between the Department of this, that and the other, Louth County Council, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Fisheries and all sorts of other red herrings.

3591596,1751,14,91,Employment Permits Bill 2005: Second Stage (Resumed).,13/10/2005,Dr. Mary Upton,The Labour Party,Dublin South-Central,"I wish to share time with Deputy Gilmore. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I have no doubt the role of migrant workers has been widely acknowledged and credited as having had a significant input into the maintenance of our economic boom, which is welcomed by everyone. It is important now to ensure that these migrant workers are given every opportunity to lead a quality of life that we would expect in a similar environment if we were on the other side of the coin. I broadly welcome the Bill which goes some distance towards improving conditions and setting out standards. However, there are a number of issues I would like to raise. We should look on our migrant workers, not just as economic units and contributors to the workforce, but primarily in terms of their rights and how they may be integrated into our community and society because of the major contribution they are making to our economic boom. We should also consider the rights of these workers’ families. My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, referred to this yesterday when he stated: . . . the fundamental principle is the one with which I began, namely that we talk about workers, their families and their rights, internationally. The discussion should be grounded and founded in rights. That is what is contained in the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. This is fundamental to how we behave as a society in treating migrant workers and acknowledging their contribution to the economy. The role of migrant workers in Ireland is widely recognised and applauded by all of us. Tremendous work is done by foreign nurses, particularly Filipinos. They are superb and have provided an excellent, quality service in many hospitals. I have had personal reasons to be very much aware of this in the past year. However, they feel their rights, particularly where they relate to their families, are being eroded. They face difficulties regarding whether their families will be permitted to visit or stay. If we are to applaud the quality of their work, the very least we might do is ensure they also enjoy a decent [1268]quality of life and rights of family, as they play a role in our society. We cannot ignore this issue. I have concerns about the manner in which work permits were issued or denied in the past. Every public representative has come across cases where decisions were taken at the whim of an official, as Deputy Gerard Murphy stated. I was approached by a number of different people regarding one case. An Indian computer analyst wanted to work for a small information technology company in the midlands. The employer was refused a work permit but, following the exploration of various other avenues, the permit was granted. There was no reason for the refusal in the first place or for the subsequent granting of the permit. What was different? While I welcome the outcome, I am concerned about the lack of transparency in these decisions and I wonder whether the permit was granted at the whim of the employer. Account must be taken of workplace conditions to ensure migrant workers are not exploited. Every public representative has dealt with cases of abuse in the workplace. Migrant workers are exploited, particularly where their knowledge of English is limited or non-existent. They are vulnerable and afraid and they feel they must dance to the tune of the employer. They are not informed about their rights or where they may seek help and the language barrier is enormous. Moves to ensure such exploitation does not recur are welcome. I welcome the change which provides that a non-national who applies for employment may transfer from one employer to another provided both employers are in the same sector. However, I am concerned that when employers have applied for the permit, non-nationals will not be able to transfer to another employer, even if he operates in the same sector. This means cases such as that involving Gama Construction could arise again. The fear is unscrupulous employers will still be able to threaten termination of a non-national’s employment and tell him or her that, unless he or she fulfils certain conditions, his or her employment will be terminated and he or she will not longer be permitted to work in Ireland. How is that an improvement on the current position? The legislation will solidify a two-tier system. One tier is for non-nationals who have the required education, skills and means necessary to apply for an employment permit. They will be granted permits which are transferable to other jobs in the same sector, which is good. However, the other tier is for non-nationals whose permits are applied for by an employer who may also be a non-national, as was the case with Gama Construction. Under the legislation, every non-national will have a profession on their work permit but will that make a difference if the non-national whose employer applied for the permit [1269]is obliged to surrender it within a month of his or her employment being terminated? I hope I am accurate in this regard but perhaps the Minister will examine the issue. The adoption of a two-tier system is a major concern.",13/10/2005,29,428,429,past Every public representative has come across cases where decisions were taken at the whim of an official as Deputy,Gerard Murphy,stated I was approached by a number of different people regarding one case An Indian computer analyst wanted to work,Gerard Murphy,3591596_3,,past Every public representative has come across cases where decisions were taken at the whim of an official as Deputy Gerard Murphy stated I was approached by a number of different people regarding one case An Indian computer analyst wanted to work,past Every public representative has come across cases where decisions were taken at the whim of an official as Deputy stated I was approached by a number of different people regarding one case An Indian computer analyst wanted to work,text445,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.039528471,0.000988212,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.471471471,0.464464464,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1196938,195,8,88,Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 20—General (Resumed).,12/05/1965,Mr. George Colley,Fianna Fáil,Dublin North-East,"I was amused to hear speakers on behalf of Fine Gael and the Labour Party yesterday and again today claiming credit for this Budget. It is rather a novel experience, I am sure, for the Minister for Finance to find the Opposition saying in effect: 'This is a very good Budget. It is so good that we cannot let you have the credit for it: we must claim it ourselves.' Let us examine the double thinking [1199] by which these Parties proceed to claim credit. The Fine Gael Party seem to think that the best way to do it is to keep repeating the phrase 'a just society'. It is rather a nice phrase but it does not in any way explain how the Fine Gael Party are responsible for this Budget. Apparently, the reasoning is that this Government had no intention of increasing social services until the Fine Gael Party told them to do so. I doubt if even the most dedicated members of Fine Gael are so naive as to believe that. The Labour Party seem to think that they should dispute the Fine Gael claims in this regard. Indeed, they claim that ever since they came into this House—I think Deputy S. Dunne said it—they have been advocating this kind of Budget. I want to suggest that the truth of the matter is that these Parties began only relatively recently to realise the real possibilities of the development of social services—and I do not mean only social welfare services. That was the time when they first admitted to themselves that this country was making good economic progress under Fianna Fáil. Up to then, they do not seem even to have envisaged any real possibility of development of our social services. However much subsequent speakers may want to dispute this claim, there is one very good test by which one can judge whether or not it is true and that is by judging the performance of those two Parties on both occasions when they were in office. I do not want to go back over the sordid history of those two occasions. I need mention merely those occasions to underline the fact that this alleged concern by the two Opposition Parties in this House for social progress—including progress on the social welfare front—is something which has happened recently. If they had this tremendous concern for the development of our social services—by which I mean education, health and social welfare— why did we not see some evidence of it when they were in a position to do something about it? The truth of the matter is that if one examines the record of the political [1200] Parties in this House—it is the safest method by which to assess the performance of any Party—one must admit that the only Party in this country which has consistently worked for the development of our social services is the Fianna Fáil Party. The Labour Party can claim a certain amount of credit. In certain fields, they did support the Fianna Fáil Government. However, there were many occasions when they did not and, in particular, when they had not got the political courage to support the necessary taxation for advances in this field. These are verifiable facts and no amount of talks about a just society or describing the Labour Party as the social conscience in this House can surmount these facts. Fianna Fáil have always realised that in order to make advances on the social front one must first advance economically. This may seem a very elementary fact: it does now, but it did not always appear so. One of the results of Fianna Fáil's realisation of this fact was that the Government Party and, in particular, the Taoiseach, have been accused of being materialistic and of being too concerned with the materialistic aspects of this nation's life. The truth is that this Government have been realistic. They have realised that any progress must be based on economic progress. As I have said, it was only when the two Opposition Parties—and Fine Gael later than the Labour Party—realised and admitted to themselves that there was genuine economic progress in this country that their minds opened and they began to examine the possibilities of advance on the social front. Despite the fact that this Government have been concerned with economic progress as a basic necessity, they have not by any means ignored social progress. We all know—despite what some people may say here on occasions—that social progress is seldom a spectacular thing: it is a matter of slow and steady advance. Unlike the Fine Gael Party who are concerned with the just society which dates from very recent times, the Fianna Fáil Government have consistently been working towards advance on the social [1201] front, that is, in education, health and social welfare. I do not propose, Sir, to go over all that ground but I do propose to quote certain figures relating to education, which is my special concern, in order to show that the Fianna Fáil Government have not in this field awakened only a few months ago or within the past few years to the necessity of developing our educational services. In the figures I should like to quote, unless I state otherwise, the comparison is between expenditure in the year 1957-58 and in the year 1965-66. In primary education, the expenditure has grown from £9 million to £17. 3 million. For primary school buildings, expenditure has grown from £1. 2 million to £2. 9 million. In the period in question approximately £14 million has been spent on new primary schools 640 new schools have been built and 502 large-scale enlargement or improvement schemes have been carried out. Most significant, I think, is that 116,750 new places have been provided in our primary schools in that period. One question in the educational field on which play is made from time to time by the Opposition Parties is the matter of scholarships. I should like to make it quite clear that I am not satisfied, and no member of my Party is satisfied, with the present position in relation to scholarships. I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that it was only in 1961, when the Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) (Amendment) Bill became law, that the State was enabled for the first time to contribute towards the cost of scholarships. Despite the tremendous concern of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties with the future of our children and their ability to obtain education irrespective of their parents' income, in both periods during which they were in office they did not find it possible to introduce legislation which would enable the State to contribute to scholarships. The present Government did so, however, and, as a result, the total [1202] number of post-primary scholarships has increased since 1961-62, from 2,668 to 7,500 in 1964-65 and the number of university scholarships from 377 to 650. It is proposed in the fairly near future to amend the Scholarship Act with a view to at least doubling the number of scholarships available. This, I suggest, is clear evidence of the fact that this Government has been steadily working out and planning for an expansion of our educational services which, again, if I may repeat myself, is dependent on economic progress. The progress which has been made on the social front has been related to the progress on the economic front. In the primary schools also the number of teachers has been increased since 1957 from 13,402 to 14,297. These are trained teachers and, indeed, we were able to discontinue the recruitment of untrained teachers in 1958. In each of the past six years the ratio of pupils to teachers has been reduced. Last year a special effort was made to reduce the ratio in Dublin city where, as the House knows, most of the large classes are concentrated. In the last year in Dublin city 104 new teaching posts were created and over 100 prefabricated classrooms were supplied. Also in the primary schools we know there have been difficulties with regard to maintenance of the schools. The amount allowed for heating and cleaning has been increased over 100 per cent since 1957 and, in addition, there are now special grants available for painting the primary schools both internally and externally. These are grants which never operated before. Some people may think these are not of vital importance in the field of education. I think they are, and we should not expect our children or our teachers to work in drab unattractive schools. Any real expansion in education is dependent not only on increased numbers of schools but also on an increased number of teachers. Teachers are not the product of a machine in a factory. One has to plan long in advance when increasing the number of teachers. Again, I should like to point out that this Government [1203] has done this. The training college for men has at the moment in course of construction an extension which is estimated to cost £1,500,000. This will enable us to increase by 50 per cent the output of male teachers from 1966. There is also a new training college being erected for Church of Ireland students at a cost of £600,000. One of our training colleges has already had installed a language laboratory and it is intended to provide a similar language laboratory at each of the other training colleges. Work has also been carried out in regard to providing reference libraries in our national schools. The scheme began in 1963 and up to date libraries have been provided in 2,000 of our national schools. It is hoped within a few years to have these supplied in all of our 4,800 national schools. This, I think, is a most important scheme and I might, in passing, be permitted to pay tribute to the librarian in Limerick County and City. I am sure Deputy Jones is familiar with the tremendous work done there in this regard. It deserves to be commended and imitated throughout the country. The problems of educating our physically and mentally handicapped children are considerable and require very great effort but, again, in pursuance of the theme which I should like to convey to the House, that is, that this Government has been consistently working for the improvement of our social services and in particular our educational services, I should like to point out that since 1957 the number of these special schools has increased from 24 to 46. Specially favourable staffing arrangements have been introduced for these schools and grants have been given for the provision of special equipment needed in this type of school. Perhaps most important of all from the point of forward planning, in 1961, training courses for teachers of the mentally and physically handicapped were established in St. Patrick's Training College and, as a result, we have been enabled to increase substantially the number of these schools. Also as an example of further forward [1204] planning, many Deputies here from time to time have expressed themselves as being very concerned about the failure in many of our schools to teach Irish adequately. Most people who are familiar with this problem are agreed that what is required is the utilisation of the most modern knowledge and the most modern methods available to us in language teaching, and to apply them to our problem in teaching Irish. In this regard a linguistic statistical survey was taken in 1963. The work is well in hand although it will take some further time—I would say probably a year and a half or so—before we have the final word.",12/05/1965,18,87,88,must claim it ourselves Let us examine the double thinking 1199 by which these Parties proceed to claim credit The,Fine Gael,Party seem to think that the best way to do it is to keep repeating the phrase a just society,Fine Gael,1196938_2,,must claim it ourselves Let us examine the double thinking 1199 by which these Parties proceed to claim credit The Fine Gael Party seem to think that the best way to do it is to keep repeating the phrase a just society,must claim it ourselves Let us examine the double thinking 1199 by which these Parties proceed to claim credit The Party seem to think that the best way to do it is to keep repeating the phrase a just society,text776,1,2,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.510825624,0.012770641,0.144115338,0.003602883,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.592592593,0.666666667,0.632632633,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2961827,515,9,142,"Private Members' Business. - Licensed Premises (Opening Hours) Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed).",01/04/1998,Mr. Jim Higgins,Fine Gael,Mayo East,"(Mayo): I thank Deputy Broughan for sharing his time. I compliment Deputy Upton for bringing forward this legislation. Despite all the controversy surrounding it, Fine Gael will support it. As Deputy Moloney stated, the number [775] of people anxious to participate in this debate exemplifies the high degree of interest in the issue, the central role of the pub in Irish life and the fact that there is a cross-party consensus on the long overdue need to radically reappraise and amend pub opening hours. Consolidating legislation is needed which deals in a comprehensive fashion with the area of liquor licensing. After that is in place we need a uniform enforcement of the law instead of a total variation in standards — rigid application in some areas and literally no application in other areas. The present system, based on a series of laws put in place by various Acts, is a shambles. Reference has been made to the founding Act of l833. There are also the Acts of 1835, l836, 1845, 1854, 1855, 1860, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1872, 1874 and l877. In the 20th century there are have Intoxicating Liquor Licensing Acts from l902, l909, l910, 1924, 1927, 1943, 1946, 1953, 1960, 1962, 1981 and 1988. It is no wonder there is confusion, in relation to the body of law governing the liquor trade. Many of the Acts build on the preceding Acts by reinforcing or strengthening them in some manner. For example, section 13 of the Licensing Act, l872, introduces a penalty for the publican who permits drunkenness or any violent quarrelsome or riotous conduct to take place in his premises or who sells any intoxicating liquor to any drunken person. Section 14 of the 1872 Act introduces a £20 fine for any licensed person who knowingly permits his premises to be the habitual resort of, or place of meeting of, reputed prostitutes whether the object of their resorting or meeting is or is not prostitution. He shall, if he allows them to remain there, or remain longer than is necessary for the purpose of obtaining reasonable refreshment, be liable to a penalty not exceeding £20 for the first offence and £40 for a second and subsequent offence. These penalties are doubled in section 30 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, l924. Section 10 of the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, provides that every person who occupies or keeps any lodging house, any beer house, public house or other house or place where intoxicating liquors are sold, or any place of public entertainment, or public resort who knowingly permits or knowingly suffers them to meet or assemble there, or knowingly allows them to deposit goods therein, having reasonable cause for believing them to be stolen, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £10. Section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquors Act, l988, deals with the sale of intoxicating liquor to those under 18 years of age. Section 34 of the same Act prohibits children unaccompanied by parents or a guardian to be on a licensed premises. The law prohibits the granting of exemptions on Saturdays. The result is that hotels all over the country which run various functions, including dinner dances on Saturday nights, are technically in breach of the licensing laws if they serve one drink past midnight or if members of the public are on the premises after midnight consuming [776] alcohol, bought on the premises, prior to that hour. In such a farcical situation the vast majority of sensible gardaí have had to turn a blind eye. The nonsense of this is further highlighted in that the same premises, which cannot get an exemption on Saturday night-Sunday morning can get an exemption on Sunday night-Monday morning without any difficulty. Senior citizens who must exit from the pub at 11 p. m. or 11. 30 p. m. on a Saturday night are met at their home doorstep by their teenage grandchildren who can be served in discos, night clubs and clubs until the early hours of the morning. I welcome the thorough and painstaking work being undertaken by the sub-committee of the Joint Committee of Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, of which Deputy Flanagan is chairman, in sifting through the mountain of legislation and evaluating the written and oral submissions. They have done tremendous work in preparing the ground for this debate which will resume after Easter and for whatever legislation will eventually emerge to bring in a sensible regime to govern this area. Reference has been made to the problem of teenage drinking. There is no doubt that there is an orgy of teenage drinking. When first-year students of 12 and 13 years of age arrive at post primary schools on a Monday morning smelling of stale alcohol fumes and visibly hungover it is time to examine and reappraise the situation. Unfortunately that is the position in virtually every post primary school in the country. There is no doubt the law on under age drinking is being disregarded in most cases. There is also the other side of the coin, parental responsibility. The performance of parents in this regard is scandalously negligent. There is absolutely no point in expecting the State to be the moral parental guardian if parents have not sufficient interest to insist on their offspring being in at a reasonable time. I am not talking about midnight or 12. 30 a. m. If they do not collect them, do not know their means of transport home, do not check their condition, do not know at what time they arrive home they are guilty of criminal negligence. If children know there are no boundaries, no limits, no parental checks and no parental interest, who can blame them if they decide to indulge? The streets of urban and rural Ireland at 3 a. m., 4 a. m. and 5 a. m. every Sunday morning are littered with bottles, beer cans, bodies, vomit, urine and blood. These young people are the mirror of the so-called modern Ireland of the new millennium. Parents are not being fair to their children by not establishing and insisting on limits. I do not know where we went wrong but I ask what has happened to the basic requirements of parental maturity and responsibility. I am a former teacher and taught until 12 years ago. At that time it was the norm that teachers attended secondary, vocational, comprehensive and community school graduation balls. It was a sine qua non. Nowadays teachers are not invited and, if they were so [777] invited, would decline because of the embarrassing performances that inevitably take place and which have become part of the graduation ball scene. The present splurge of teenage drunkenness is serious and is wreaking havoc on society. The rack and the ruin has yet to be seen in many cases. The combination of under age drinking, late drinking and takeaways where people disgorge from discos and dance halls at 2 a. m. and 3 a. m. means that many of the streets in rural Ireland have become no-go areas. Many senior citizens are no longer able to enjoy peace and quiet in the tranquillity of their homes. We have a major public order problem which is fuelled to a large extent by uncontrolled under age drinking. The law has a role. I do not want to pre-empt the steering committee's recommendations in its report. It is clear that sensible consolidating legislation is required. People will argue it should be laissez faire, that pubs should be allowed to remain open for as long as they wish. They cite the United States and the European situation in support of same. For some reason in the whole area of alcohol consumption we have yet to come of age as a nation. I agree with the argument for extending the hours. However, there is something in the Irish psychology to indicate that if the opening hours are extended to 1 a. m., people will not arrive in the pub until 12. 45 a. m. If the opening hours are extended to 2 a. m. or 3 a. m., people will not arrive in the pub until 1. 45 a. m. or 2. 45 a. m. I do not know the reason but that is the reality. I plead with the Minister to enforce all the laws uniformly. It is impossible to understand the present selective purge in relation to the strict enforcement of the licensing laws in the four counties of Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Clare. I have no problem with enforcing the law rigidly across the board. However, I understand that for this zero tolerance additional Garda personnel are not required. It is a case of sending an unequivocal message to publicans in these counties that they must close on time. The corollary of this message, and the policy which is in contrast to it, has to be that after hours drinking is tolerated in the other 22 counties. This selective application of the law is what happens in totalitarian regimes. The law must have national application or else it should be scrapped. What is happening is unfair and, perhaps, unconstitutional in that the principle of fair and even-handed enforcement of the law is being flouted. An argument is put forward to extend the licensing laws from the point of view of tourism. I do not agree with this. I have a theory that most tourists like to go to bed early and get up early to avail of whatever is on offer from the tour companies. The majority of pubs would get very few tourists hanging around at 11 or 12 o'clock at night. I support the spirit of this Bill but the concerns of MANDATE are genuine. There is an erosion of professionalism in the bar trade as witnessed [778] by the fact that very few apprentices are doing the three year Dublin Institute of Technology course. There is a major danger that extending the licensing hours will lead to growing casualisation, double-jobbing and a further development of the black economy. I appreciate that Deputy Upton has tried to redress this in sections 9 to 19. However, far more dialogue is needed with MANDATE. There is obvious abuse. Some floor staff are being paid £5 per night in Dublin to work from 7 p. m. until 1 a. m. This indicates how the black economy is thriving in the trade. I urge the Government to give serious consideration to the Bill. I support the broad thrust of it.",01/04/1998,28,1687,1688,the licensing hours will lead to growing casualisation double-jobbing and a further development of the black economy I appreciate that,Deputy Upton,has tried to redress this in sections 9 to 19 However far more dialogue is needed with MANDATE There is,Deputy Upton,2961827_6,,the licensing hours will lead to growing casualisation double-jobbing and a further development of the black economy I appreciate that Deputy Upton has tried to redress this in sections 9 to 19 However far more dialogue is needed with MANDATE There is,the licensing hours will lead to growing casualisation double-jobbing and a further development of the black economy I appreciate that has tried to redress this in sections 9 to 19 However far more dialogue is needed with MANDATE There is,text638,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.336269123,0.008406728,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.897897898,0.844844845,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4175766,2318,22,34,Programme for Government: Motion,15/03/2011,Ms. Sandra McLellan,Sinn Féin,Cork East,"I am proud and honoured to give my first speech in the Dáil Chamber as a Sinn Féin Deputy. I thank the people of Cork East for putting their faith in me to represent them and their interests. I also thank my family and all those who worked tirelessly to put forward the Sinn Féin alternative platform over the course of the election campaign. [109]I was elected to stand up for ordinary working people and families, for the unemployed, the sick and the vulnerable. In the course of my campaign I said that there was a better and a fairer way, that there is an alternative to the status quo and that Sinn Féin is that alternative. I believe in Sinn Féin’s alternative vision and I will do my utmost to make that vision a reality. It is my intention to use my time as a Deputy to put forward proposals that are credible, that work and, most of all, that are fair. I intend to stand up for what is right and to fight against what is wrong. As a woman with a family I am acutely aware of the fact that not only are women totally under-represented in politics but also that we have borne the brunt of cutbacks and austerity measures foisted upon us by the previous Government. Last week marked the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day and it is in that spirit that I make a commitment to use my time as a Deputy to stand up for women and to drive forward issues that are relevant to women in Ireland today. The political system is totally out of date and removed from the ordinary person. We must put people-power back on the agenda. We must ensure that the Government works for the people and not for vested interests. The politics of cronyism is alive and well. Our political system is dominated by middle-aged, middle-class men in suits working for other middle-aged, middle-class men in suits. We need real and radical reform to bring politics back to what it is supposed to be — a system that works for the people and is run by the people. People throughout the State are suffering. Unemployment is sky-rocketing. Upwards of 100,000 people will be forced to emigrate in the next two years in search of work. In my own constituency unemployment is growing rapidly. Towns such as Youghal, Cobh, Mallow and Mitchelstown are ghosts of what they once were. Whether it is Tytex in Youghal or the beet factory in Mallow, jobs are being haemorrhaged left, right and centre and urgent action must be taken. The new Government must make the creation and retention of jobs its number one priority. The programme for Government is vague in that regard and does not offer much hope for the hundreds of thousands who have found themselves out of work and struggling to cope with rising costs. We in Sinn Féin have put forward our proposals for job creation. I ask Fine Gael and Labour in particular to take those proposals on board. Our fully costed proposals have the potential to create 160,000 jobs. We would do this through a variety of measures including investing in a jobs stimulus fund, unleashing the potential of growth sectors such as agrifood and constructing essential infrastructure. We have shown that there are solutions and there are ways to get Ireland working. The people have put their faith in the new Government to get the economy back on track, to make a change. However, change will not be achieved through a change of faces. Real change can only be achieved through policies which work for the people. Fine Gael’s flawed policies of cuts, privatisation and attacks on the public sector are reminiscent of the very worst of Fianna Fáil’s disastrous tenure in government. The Labour Party, unfortunately, is now part of that coalition for cuts. We in Sinn Féin have pledged to use our position in opposition to hold the Government to account and we will do so as we have done in the past. We will provide a voice for those who have been let down by the political elite and we will continue to put forward our radical alternative and to stand up for the people.",15/03/2011,31,654,655,Fianna Fáil's disastrous tenure in government The Labour Party unfortunately is now part of that coalition for cuts We in,Sinn Féin,have pledged to use our position in opposition to hold the Government to account and we will do so as,Sinn Féin,4175766_7,,Fianna Fáil's disastrous tenure in government The Labour Party unfortunately is now part of that coalition for cuts We in Sinn Féin have pledged to use our position in opposition to hold the Government to account and we will do so as,Fianna Fáil's disastrous tenure in government The Labour Party unfortunately is now part of that coalition for cuts We in have pledged to use our position in opposition to hold the Government to account and we will do so as,text333,3,1,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-0.84729786,-0.021182447,-0.570034231,-0.014250856,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.153153153,0.163163163,0.009009009,0.034034034,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4237497,2343,9,108,Community and Voluntary Sector: Motion (Resumed),12/10/2011,Mr. Seán Kyne,Fine Gael,Galway West,"As a public representative, I have seen at first hand the significant contribution community and voluntary organisations have made to every town and village. Thousands of organisations in the not-for-profit voluntary and community sector transform Irish society for the better each day in ways that other sectors cannot. Included in the voluntary organisations are those local community development groups and parish councils that meet weekly or monthly to plan events, fund-raise for projects and set up meetings and, in many cases, become the driving force behind community projects. Individuals give freely of their time and-or expertise to help their communities for no reason other than to improve their localities. Tidy Towns groups were mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, yesterday. Such groups provide sterling service to improve their surroundings and inspire pride for towns where improvements become visible. County councils are also important sources of funding for Tidy Towns and community groups. Despite the cutbacks, it is good that such small grants continue. These grants are valuable to local communities. In recent weeks, I have attended a number of briefings and spoken with members of community and voluntary organisations such as the Carers Association, Marriage Equality, the Simon Communities and Older and Bolder, all of which tirelessly combat problems and issues and seek changes that can make a difference to the lives of many citizens. We are all too aware of the financial and economic crisis being experienced by society. It must be said that community and voluntary organisations, acutely aware of the constraints on resources, have displayed a commendable understanding and a remarkable resilience at seeking new ways of doing more with less and of striving for efficiencies without sacrificing effectiveness. Other non-governmental organisations, such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Free Legal Advice Centres have been instrumental in the recently completed universal periodic review of Ireland by consulting with communities and outlining areas of concern in respect of our human rights obligations. The United Nations and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, recognised the significant contribution of the Rights Now coalition of NGOs. This recognition is verification of the regard and respect that exists at Government level for our partners in the community and voluntary sector. Without doubt, the State will continue to work with such organisations as we examine ways to improve the legislative framework for human rights. In the motion, Sinn Féin states that the Government has inflicted cutbacks on community and voluntary groups, specifically those that have spoken out against Government policies. This is inaccurate and an untruth. Both Government parties have upheld democratic principles and vindicated essential freedoms such as that of speech and expression without fear when others at darker moments in our history have not. Despite such calculated accusations being made against us, I assure all citizens that the Government will continue to support community and voluntary organisations that share the goals of protecting the vulnerable and disadvan[487]taged, upholding and respecting rights and making society fairer and more equitable despite the traumatic economic times in which we are living. I commend the Government on its plans for an interim report on philanthropy. Last week saw the Global Irish Economic Forum in Dublin Castle. I hope it can encourage the Irish diaspora to continue supporting our community and voluntary sectors, investing in our businesses and creating jobs.",12/10/2011,31,340,341,areas of concern in respect of our human rights obligations The United Nations and the Minister for Justice and Equality,Deputy Shatter,recognised the significant contribution of the Rights Now coalition of NGOs This recognition is verification of the regard and respect,Deputy Shatter,4237497_2,,areas of concern in respect of our human rights obligations The United Nations and the Minister for Justice and Equality Deputy Shatter recognised the significant contribution of the Rights Now coalition of NGOs This recognition is verification of the regard and respect,areas of concern in respect of our human rights obligations The United Nations and the Minister for Justice and Equality recognised the significant contribution of the Rights Now coalition of NGOs This recognition is verification of the regard and respect,text847,1,8,0,0,40,0.175,7,1.734601055,0.043365026,0.83800358,0.020950089,0.990990991,0.998998999,0.936936937,0.873873874,0.996996997,0.975975976,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3045407,749,6,184,"Private Members' Business. - Local Government (Planning and Development) (Amendment) Bill, 1999: Second Stage (Resumed).",12/05/1999,Ms. Liz McManus,Democratic Left,Wicklow,"We are entitled to ask questions as to why the Government has refused to accept the Bill. It is legitimate and it is certainly an issue the people will raise with us when we knock on their doors. Why has the Government refused to accept the Bill? There have been complaints for a long time regarding unfinished estates. No councillors have been more vociferous than Fianna Fáil members for continually berating local authority officials [967] for not dealing with the issue of estates which have not been taken in charge. Why is a Fianna Fáil Minister not doing something about this? Having worked in the Department I have great confidence in the capability of officials to deal with deficiencies in the Bill. Why is the Bill not being accepted, particularly when the debate is taking place against a background of investigations into the most unsavoury links between Fianna Fáil and developers? If anything, this should galvanise a Fianna Fáil Minister, whose integrity I trust, to show by example that he will face down what is being done by developers. The Minister said the consolidation planning Bill will be before the House soon. I have difficulty with terms such as 'shortly', used by the Taoiseach, and 'in the near future'. It is clear that neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister can guarantee that they will be in Government in the near future, let alone that they can deliver a planning Bill, welcome as it would be. This morning the Taoiseach was shamed into accepting a Labour Party Private Members' Bill from Deputy O'Sullivan with regard to statutes of limitations. It can be done – the Minister has a choice as to whether to deal with this issue seriously or whether to reject it and continue regardless. This morning the Government was shamed because of recent revelations by excellent television programmes. However, there is a shamelessness concerning this Bill. The Minister is trying to browbeat and attack the Opposition for a failure on his part. Why is this Bill being rejected when elections are pending? Is it because Fianna Fáil candidates are expecting developers and builders to bankroll their campaigns? Reform on the never-never is very reassuring for developers who are making enormous profits out of housing. It is not good enough for the Government to simply reject this Bill because it is deficient. Of course there are deficiencies. We are limited in what we can put forward but the Minister knows that the Bill is basically sound. It is a disgrace that he is adopting a cavalier approach when he has the option to take it on board at a time when voters are cynical about the power of the political system to deliver their needs. Many people are still living in estates which have been unfinished for 18 or 20 years. It is not just that people are living in unfinished estates, they are also being denied basic infrastructural services such as gas because of difficulties with builders. An estate in Greystones is being denied gas because the builder has not given permission and the estate has not been taken in charge. I have a litany of unfinished estates in County Wicklow, some of which have spectacularly awful histories. I will not go into that now but the rejection of the Bill will be noted by the public which is more aware of the nature of Fianna Fáil's connections with the building industry and rogue builders. People understand what is happening by [968] the Government rejecting this Bill. We do not need to tell people what is happening, but when asked we will have to explain that the Labour Party put forward a Bill to deal with a long standing problem which has constantly been asked for by Fianna Fáil councillors who blame everyone but themselves.",12/05/1999,28,346,347,Opposition for a failure on his part Why is this Bill being rejected when elections are pending Is it because,Fianna Fáil,candidates are expecting developers and builders to bankroll their campaigns Reform on the never-never is very reassuring for developers who,Fianna Fáil,3045407_6,,Opposition for a failure on his part Why is this Bill being rejected when elections are pending Is it because Fianna Fáil candidates are expecting developers and builders to bankroll their campaigns Reform on the never-never is very reassuring for developers who,Opposition for a failure on his part Why is this Bill being rejected when elections are pending Is it because candidates are expecting developers and builders to bankroll their campaigns Reform on the never-never is very reassuring for developers who,text393,3,1,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-0.84729786,-0.021182447,-0.031234752,-0.000780869,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.153153153,0.163163163,0.306306306,0.308308308,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

800219,461,9,151,Vote 57—Army Pensions (Resumed).,26/06/1952,Capt. Patrick Giles,Fine Gael,Meath-Westmeath,"I am glad that the House appears to be united in relation to the Old I. R.A. It is heartening to know that, but it is humiliating to find that after 30 years we still have to appeal here on behalf of these people. These men should have been treated generously in the past. Unfortunately they were not so treated. The Old I. R.A. never looked for a pension. It was forced upon them. I was an Army officer in 1924 when we discovered that the majority of the men who had taken part in the conflict between the years 1917 and 1924 were being turfed out of the Army with £25 or £30 apiece. We did not take that lying down and a militant section joined together to fight our case. We had disruption in the Army and in this House with the result that the Government of the day said: 'We will have to do something about it or we are going to have further civil strife.' There would have been if we were thrown out with not one penny in our pockets after keeping the Government [1695] in power and winning the country its freedom. We find the same thing to-day with regard to the Army Pensions Acts. We never looked for a pension, but what we did look for was a decent gratuity. We wanted to see Army officers getting £1,000 and be done with it. We were well entitled to that. We wanted also to see that privates in the Old I. R.A. would get, as they were entitled to get, £500 or £1,000, so that they would have a chance of settling themselves in life. That was not done. The Government said that they had no money to spend and that they could not do it. In many cases, these men were looked upon as a nuisance. Here we are, 30 years after, making the same appeal. In the meantime, Pensions Act after Pensions Act has been passed. We have spent thousands of pounds on a pensions board which has been sitting since 1924. The whole thing is make-believe with files and secretaries, etc. I am satisfied that more money has been spent on pension boards and their staffs than would have provided decent treatment for every Old I. R.A. man, irrespective of his class. All that hateful nonsense has gone on over the years. I do not blame any particular Government for this. They all did it. You had men chucked out in 1924. Many of them have since died. Some of them were given pensions of £5 or £6 a year. That was an insult to offer to men who had been fighting for the country's freedom from 1916 on. I say that was a shame as regards the first Government we had, to the Government that succeeded it and to every Government we have had. There were only a few thousand men to be dealt with and they should have been treated generously. We are making a final appeal now that justice be done to the Old I. R.A. men. We want a decent floor put under this Pensions Act. We want to see that men who are getting £5 or £6 a year will get something generous. In my opinion, any Old I. R.A. man would be entitled to at least £1 a week of a pension, and I would not thank any Government for giving them that. These were the men who secured for [1696] us the right to speak here and to legislate for the Irish people. They endured great sufferings and humiliations. I hope, therefore, that at the eleventh hour, the Minister will hearken to the appeal which has been made by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Independents. It is a noble appeal that has been made on behalf of the remnants of the Old I. R.A. who are living. We ask that justice be done to them. Since the cost of living commenced to rise, every State employee in this country has got an increase in his pension. That has not been so with the Old I. R.A. They are treated as the cinderellas of the country. I cannot understand that. Many of them are old and infirm now. I know where they would be to-day if they were in their old health and vigour. They would be marching on this State demanding their rights. If this happened in 1921, the Government of the day would have to realise that we were alive and still fit to fight. I want to see this pensions board wound up as soon as possible. I want to see an end to all this struggling and squabbling that has been going on. We have certain men running the board at one period and when there is a change of Government another set of men take over. That is not fair. A pensions board should do its duty speedily and well. The work could be done speedily and well if the proper course was followed in regard to the applications which are lodged. These applications should be dealt with by the officers who were in charge of brigades and divisions. They should be the judge and jury in the cases of these Old I. R.A. men and nobody else. I am satisfied that if our first Government had been big enough we would have been spared a lot of the bickering that went on afterwards. My idea would be to give a pension to every man who fought from 1916 to 1921, and to stop at that. I would be in favour of giving a pension to those who fought against us as well as those who fought with us in that period. Let the Pensions Act be a generous one and be applied to every man, no matter on what side he fought. If that had been done in 1921 I am satisfied we would have been spared all [1697] the squabbling and strife that has gone on over the last 30 years. We would not be sitting on different sides here to-day. It is because the matter was approached in a small, narrow, mean way that we have had Pensions Act after Pensions Act during the last 30 years. Justice has not been done to the Old I. R.A. men. If those men had been allowed to go before a tribunal composed of the officers of the different brigades and divisions in which they fought there is no doubt but that this question would have been settled long ago. The evidence of the men, no matter on what side they took part, would have been listened to. Those officers should have been given the power to legislate on behalf of their comrades. They would have the knowledge to sift the evidence given before them and would know who was or who was not a genuine Old I. R.A. man. Of course, the Government of that time was too narrow and wanted to exclude the men who fought against it in the Civil War. The next Government in 1932 did the same thing. You had all that strife and struggling going on over the years. All that had its reactions on the country. We who fought in the Army were paid for our service and then we were chucked out in 1924 on a small pittance. It was not enough to enable one to go on 'the booze' for a week. That was what was offered to us after spending our lives fighting for the country. We spent our terms in prisons, and risked our lives in ambushes. We had brother Irishmen fighting us during the Civil War. All that we wanted was to get something that would enable us to set ourselves up in life again. We did not want to be a drag on the nation. They gave us £50 to set ourselves up in life. The 'boyos' who did not join the I. R.A. were able to get the good jobs. They did not risk their lives. They were not beggared and broken. The men who had to suffer the hard and bitter things were forgotten and have been forgotten to this day by the first Government and the Governments that have followed it. They looked upon us as a damned nuisance and nothing more. I am not going to mince my [1698] words in regard to any of our Governments where Old I. R.A. men are concerned. The number of them who are entitled to pensions now cannot be very great, and surely it is time they were treated generously. The Minister is an honourable man. He is listening to me and I am sure is saying to himself, 'Giles is right.' He was in charge of a brigade himself. I am sure he knew every man in it, and could tell who was or was not entitled to a pension. The same is true of the whole country. The brigade commanders knew the men who served under them. It is because politics has played its dirty part that we have been kept asunder and never got a chance of coming together. We have that same old squabble still going on. I saw an example of it in Waterford a few days ago with half the Old I. R.A. men there wanting to march behind the Taoiseach while the other half did not want to march behind him. These unfortunate men did want to march behind the Taoiseach and would want to march behind Deputy Costello if he were Head of the Government. They want to do justice to the Irish Government. But no. Politics must play their mean part and we must be divided year in and year out. I hope our appeal will be a final appeal and that we will not have to come in here next year and beg again on behalf of a few stragglers who may be left out. I would ask the Minister to be generous and big. I know that he is generous and big and I know that the Taoiseach is a big and generous man. Politics are there all the time. An all-Party committee of this House should be set up with a view to getting rid of all the difficulties and doing justice to the few who are left. They should be given decent and generous treatment. We could have afforded to spend £2,000,000 in 1924 in giving justice to the 5,000 or 6,000 men who fought. We were told at that time that we could not afford it. We have spent hundreds of millions since that time. Yet, we could not spend £2,000,000 then. We should have spent that amount of money at that time so that all these men could have been settled in happy [1699] homes, working with their fellow Irishmen. We of the Old I. R.A. do not want Party strife. We want to be able to meet in Dublin, no matter what side we took, as brother Irishmen, having a common cause. We want to end our life saying, 'Thanks be to God. We have lived through troublesome times and we are now united.' We want to be of use to the younger generation and be able to say to them that they have a job to fulfil, that is, to secure an Irish Ireland of 32 counties and that we will give them any help we can. Party strife, Party politics keep them divided and as long as they are divided that is all right for political Parties but it is not all right for the nation. This nation could be further advanced than it is if only we had used common sense 25 or 30 years ago. I would appeal to the Minister to try to put this matter above Party politics. The appeal we make is a noble appeal. It is an appeal on behalf of a very few men. There are not a few thousand of us left. We are in the humiliating position that when one of our comrades dies and we go to his funeral, when the salute has been fired over his grave, we find that we have to send the hat around to collect in order to have a few Masses said for the repose of his soul and we often have to try to help the little family that he leaves behind. In the town of Trim there is a man who had been a good officer. He has nine children. He has a small pension. He is suffering from a varicose ulcer. He loses a great deal of employment as a result. He has appealed to be taken into some hospital at a cheap rate. He cannot afford to pay. He has appealed to the Army authorities and to political authorities to get him into St. Bricin's or some hospital for free treatment. He could be cured. Instead of that, he is left there. The pain of the wound in his leg is nothing to the pain of remorse at seeing his family in misery, his wife wondering how she will be able to make ends meet, when there is nothing coming into the house. These are the things we see down the [1700] country. The people in Dublin may not see them. Along the roads of Trim and Navan I see a few Old I. R.A. men hobbling out of the poorhouse on sticks trying to meet a few comrades or friends who will give them a drink or an ounce of tobacco. That should not be. It is terrible to see these men almost beggars in the land they made. It is a frightful state of affairs. I would ask the Minister to have a full review of the whole position. There is no use talking about the few pensioners who are left. Their case should be dealt with quickly. In the case of disability pensions, they should be of such an amount that a man can live on them. The disability pensions are a public disgrace, at starvation level. I am not blaming this Government, I am blaming all Governments for it. Another matter is the abatement of pensions. Some men try to get a few days' work under the county council, draining streams and rivers. If they get such work and if they have a pension of £5 or £6, the pension is cut off. That is a public disgrace. These pensions were given for services rendered to their country. There is no thanks due to anybody for them. The men are entitled to every penny of them. Even if they were earning £10,000 a year, even if they were President of the Republic, they would be fully entitled to the pension for services rendered and there should be no abatement or whittling down of that pension. The cost of living affects the Old I. R.A. man just as it affects everyone else. How is it that civil servants and others can have their salaries and pensions stepped up while the Old I. R.A. are ignored? We in this House must have been asleep as far as justice is concerned. I am satisfied that we have wakened up now and I am glad that there are men on all sides of the House who are genuine Old I. R.A. men, who can stand with their heads up and their chests out, having regard to the service they rendered. I would ask them to make a united effort to do the right thing for the Old I. R.A. and, when that is done, I hope that [1701] we will meet in the Mansion House, shake hands and be comrades in arms and show that we can unite. There is work to be done yet. Justice must be done to every man, whether he is poor or well off. I would ask the Minister to listen to our appeal. Mr. Byrne: I wish to add my voice to the united appeal that has been made to the Minister. We can all have confidence that the Minister will do the right thing but it is well that he should get a little support so that he can make that extra demand on the Department of Finance to meet the appeal that has been made from every side of the House. Within the last month or so we all received a circular setting out the claims of the Old I. R.A. It was signed by well-known persons who served in 1916. Piaras Beaslaoi, Colonel Gay, a man named O'Connor and a number of men whom I met some years ago behind prison walls signed the circular. They served the country and served it well. Deputy Giles has reminded us that the cost of living affects the Old I. R.A. men as well as other people. The Minister ought to secure some increase in their pensions. I join in the plea for that. My attention has been brought very forcibly to a rather sad case of a member of the Old Cumann na mBan, who has no pension and who is now in a nursing home. Her friends are doing their best to keep her in the comfort to which she is entitled. In 1915 and 1916 that lady rendered magnificent service to the State. She is well known to every member of the Front Bench. I will give her name to the Minister later. This lady has never applied for a pension. I want to know if there is a fund out of which she can be provided for. I know that this lady is most deserving and her colleagues, members of the Old Cumann na mBan, will be most anxious to come forward and give any evidence the Minister requires so that she will get something to supplement the small comforts that are being provided for her by her relatives. This lady is a widow. Her [1702] husband had been a civil servant, in a very good position. Her husband died. Because he was a civil servant, the lady in question did not or would not apply for a pension. If there is anything that can be done for that lady, who served the country, I earnestly hope that the Minister will do it. We were all made aware of the sad plight and, shall I say, the niggardly treatment of the widow of a flying officer who met his death in the service of the State. That widow finds the income of the family reduced from £700 or £800 a year to something like £200. I feel that something will be done for that widow. I earnestly hope that the widow and children of that officer will be treated properly, as well as the widow and children of other officers and men. I hope that a reasonable increase will be given to them to meet the increased cost of living and that sufficient allowance will be made to them to enable them to give the education to their children which it was intended to give them. These children ought not to suffer because their fathers died while in the Service. I should also like to refer to the cases of I. R.A. pensioners employed by local authorities, whether as attendants or in a professional capacity. Men gave valuable service in the period from 1916 onwards and their services warranted their being awarded a fair pension at the time. I do not think that any of us could call it a fair pension now. In order to buy the same quantity of food to-day their pensions would have to be doubled. It is only right that we should support the Minister in any request he may make to the Department of Finance to increase the pensions of those who served the country, whether as private soldiers or as officers. To come back to the cases of those pensioners employed in the public service, let us take the case of an attendant or a doorkeeper employed in the Government service or by the Dublin Corporation at £5 or £6 a week, or even £8 or £10 a week. As soon as such a person gets employment in the public service the pension which he earned for the risks he took and the [1703] service he rendered is, as a result of a means test, taken from him. There is one case of which the Minister has personal knowledge and which I raised some time ago. The Minister did inquire into that case and remedied some of the grievances. Then take the case of an Old I. R.A. man who is past his work. If the income of his family increases a means tests is applied and his pension is reduced, if not taken from him altogether. I have in mind the case of a man who had a pension of £90 a year. In the course of time that was brought down to £9 a year. I have not seen him for some time and it may be that his grievance has been remedied. If it has not been remedied it would appear, from the fact that I have not seen him, that he is in ill-health. I hope that the public service employees who were awarded I. R.A. pensions and who got some small job because of their service to the country will have their pensions restored to them. Their pensions should not be taken from them because they got a job worth £5 or £6, or even £10 a week. In the old days anyone who employed people with a pension were accused of availing of their pensions to give them low wages, of looking for cheap labour and not giving workers what they were entitled to. That applies now to the Government and local authorities all over the country, including Dublin. Men who were awarded pensions had their pensions taken away from them because they got a job as a messenger, as a steward, or perhaps in a professional capacity. I hope the Minister will see that these pensions are restored. In the case of the Old I. R.A. men the pension should be increased. Those of them who are left are entitled to something better than we are doing for them. People may be rather surprised that I should feel so strongly about them. I suppose no Deputy met more of the Old I. R.A. collected together than I did. I met them in Frongoch and in Wandsworth and in Knutsford jails. In fact I met them in nearly every prison in England. At that time they were in lots of 500 and I had only a nodding acquaintance [1704] with most of them. I am always happy to know when they are doing well. But there are perhaps 5 per cent. of them who are not doing well like those described by Deputy Giles. I can hardly credit that some of these old soldiers were allowed to die in union hospitals. I hope the condition of some of these men is not as bad as he described, that men who served the country when they meet their friends hope to get a packet of cigarettes from them. If what Deputy Giles says is true, it is a shame for all the Governments which are responsible for such a thing taking place.

3510995,1000,9,147,Estimates for Public Services 2005:,25/11/2004,Mr. Michael Ring,Fine Gael,Mayo West,"I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, discussing overseas aid but I am not surprised to see that the Government has reneged on another promise by cutting [795]back on funding for those agencies. It is no wonder when one considers what the Government did to the poor. Last year, we had the savage 16 cutbacks that affected so many households. We are now told that a review is under way and one of the cuts concerning the widow’s payment has been reversed. On budget day, next Wednesday, I hope the other 15 savage cutbacks will also be reversed. Now that we have a real socialist Taoiseach, I expect to see great things happening next week for the less well-off in society. In recent years, more millionaires have been created in this country than anywhere else in Europe. We have certainly looked after the rich. In fairness to the Progressive Democrats, it does not have many seats but I compliment its members on the way they have delivered in Government. Along with Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats has looked after the builders and the super rich, making them increasingly rich. On top of that, the Government has even been able to organise matters so that the very rich do not have to pay a penny in tax to the State. I compliment the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on that. Now that the Taoiseach has realised he wants to be a socialist, however, I hope the less well-off will be looked after in the budget. We can all talk about how wonderfully the economy is going but the Government will be judged on how people are treated. There are three categories of people in the country: the super rich who are getting richer the middle class who are being squeezed by stealth taxes, are under pressure to pay their way and for whom the Government has done nothing and the poor who have been let down by the Government. The Minister for Finance should pay attention to special educational needs. Recently, I attended a meeting in Castlebar where I listened to the concerns of 70 or 80 parents about autism. I saw their frustration, anger, annoyance and hurt because nothing was being done for them. There is no support or help for them. The Government will be judged next week by those who have disabilities. The new Minister for Education and Science said she will deal with the issue of assistance for special needs, but I am fed up with spin. The Government is not much good when it comes to medical doctoring but it certainly is good at spin doctoring. Next week’s budget presents an opportunity to reintroduce some balance in society. Earlier this week I spoke to a representative of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in my town of Westport. This year I have seen many people coming to my constituency office complaining that they cannot survive on low incomes and have fallen into debt. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has never had so many people seeking its assistance. Is this the sort of society we want? It is worse than some Third World countries. We are forgetting about our own, including the poor who have been let down by the Government. [796]During last year’s Budget Statement, I saw Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats backbenchers applauding the announcement on decentralisation. Some of the Independent Members also applauded, although they are not really independent and are worse than Fianna Fáil. They vote for Fianna Fáil on every occasion because they think they will shortly get the call to Government when Fianna Fáil gets rid of the Progressive Democrats. The people will make a serious judgment on them in a short time when they are asked to vote for the next Government. We saw what occurred with decentralisation. It was like what happened when Manchester United won the FA Cup final. Government Deputies were clapping for ten or 15 minutes when the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, misled the people. Yesterday we saw a new decentralisation list on the Government’s website. My county of Mayo was promised decentralisation, with the Office of Public Works relocating to Claremorris and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to Knock, but nothing has happened. We have now gone into the second league and are in difficulties. I can predict what will happen in about a year’s time, just before the general election. Ministers will arrive to be photographed for the local newspapers and will stand on a site which they will claim is being examined for decentralisation purposes. The spin doctors, photographers and press people will be on the road again before the general election with Ministers saying they will deliver. People have had enough of spin, however, and will not take it any longer. A factory in Ballinrobe has obtained the best value for money that anybody could get. Last year, over €115,000 was paid for the premises which has a 25-year lease, yet nobody has ever occupied it. The Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, has responsibility for education. Scoil Raifteirí in Castlebar was built six or seven years ago but, after four years, the Department of Education and Science had to replace the roof, even though it had already cost the taxpayer €1 million. Neither the Minister of State nor her officials have done anything about it. Somebody should have to answer for that and explain why a new school needed a new roof after only four years. The architects cannot take the blame, the Department will not take the blame and neither will the builders. There is something wrong when somebody can invest €1 million in a new school, yet after four years it needs a new roof. It is time for a change in the Department and a change of Government so that people have an opportunity to see some fairness in society.",25/11/2004,29,153,154,created in this country than anywhere else in Europe We have certainly looked after the rich In fairness to the,Progressive Democrats,it does not have many seats but I compliment its members on the way they have delivered in Government Along,Progressive Democrats,3510995_3,,created in this country than anywhere else in Europe We have certainly looked after the rich In fairness to the Progressive Democrats it does not have many seats but I compliment its members on the way they have delivered in Government Along,created in this country than anywhere else in Europe We have certainly looked after the rich In fairness to the it does not have many seats but I compliment its members on the way they have delivered in Government Along,text886,0,4,0,0,40,0.1,4,2.197224577,0.054930614,0.335992001,0.0083998,0.94994995,0.974974975,0.978978979,0.923923924,0.896896897,0.843843844,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1663980,228,14,181,"Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1974: Second Stage (Resumed).",17/12/1974,Mr. Brendan Corish,The Labour Party,Wexford,"Circumstances change from year to year. The Deputy cannot get away from the policy, if it is still the policy, of the Fianna Fáil Party. The late ex-Minister for Health said that these contributions would not remain static and were bound to increase. This Bill increases the rates established in 1971, after a period of three years. Deputies are well aware of and appreciate the fact that all other costs have risen, particularly in the health services, during that time. I should like to give again the increases that have occurred in the past two or three years. In 1971-72, the health services were costed at £86 million. By 1974, they were £166 million, an increase of £80 million or a 93 per cent increase. It is only reasonable to expect that the health contributions would also increase. The health contributions are only one element in the method of financing the health services. It is one I inherited from the previous Government and to which I presume the Fianna Fáil Party still subscribe. There is another factor which should be taken into consideration in regard to the type of person mentioned in this Bill. During the period [2092] 1971-72 to 1974 the cost of the limited eligibility services increased by over 90 per cent. If there is hypocrisy—the word used by the Deputy many times during his speech—it is on Deputy O'Malley's side. He is now condemning a system of financing introduced by my predecessor and which Fianna Fáil said they would continue as a method of financing the services. He made another accusation. He called the introduction of this measure a subterfuge. I do not know exactly what he meant by that. This proposal is open and above board in that, although the Deputy called it another taxation Bill, it will give more money to the health services. It is directed at the health services alone. I do not think anybody would be justified in describing it as another taxation Bill. I am not enamoured of the present system and neither is Deputy O'Connell. I propose to carry on that system as Minister for Health until I see whether we can find other methods of financing the health services. There were criticisms and sneers—I think by Deputy R. P. Burke—to the effect that when the Government found themselves in trouble they established a review body. I do not see anything wrong in that. I do not pretend to be an economist or to be the custodian of all things appertaining to the financing of the health services. As I said in my opening speech, I propose to establish a review body which, in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare will see how best these two services can be financed. Deputy O'Connell suggested that a committee of the House might be set up to carry out this review. My instant reaction to that is that I do not believe that a committee of the Dáil or the Dáil plus the Seanad would be an appropriate body for making recommendations on this matter. I think Deputy O'Connell was in the House when the Fianna Fáil Government of the day established an all-party committee to examine the health services. So far as I can remember it came to nought. Nothing significant came from it. I think it was established at that time merely to placate a certain Independent Deputy whose vote was [2093] badly required by the Fianna Fáil Party.",17/12/1974,20,577,578,was established at that time merely to placate a certain Independent Deputy whose vote was 2093 badly required by the,Fianna Fáil,Party,Fianna Fáil,1663980_9,,was established at that time merely to placate a certain Independent Deputy whose vote was 2093 badly required by the Fianna Fáil Party,was established at that time merely to placate a certain Independent Deputy whose vote was 2093 badly required by the Party,text404,1,0,0,0,21,-0.047619048,-1,-1.098612289,-0.052314871,-0.078262379,-0.00372678,0.118118118,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.037037037,0.242242242,0.192192192,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1443087,272,14,88,Confidence in Taoiseach and Government: Motion (Resumed).,04/11/1970,Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien,The Labour Party,Dublin North-East,"Deputy Burke has not heard my speech so far. I am glad he has now joined the company. I would ask him, with respect, not to interrupt me before he knows what I am trying to say. The Tralee speech kept the moderate 'peace and stability' voters in line: that was important. The Letterkenny speech reassured the republicans. The Taoiseach and his party were thus walking—as they like to do and as they do so well—both sides of the street. As far as concerned what Deputy Haughey and Deputy Blaney were actually doing, the Taoiseach, who is no fool, must certainly have been aware that they were playing a dangerous game, even if he did not know and even if we do not yet know all its details. But it was dangerous for them and for the country—not for him. If all went well for them, some of the credit would rub off on him: it would in some eyes, even if it did not go quite that far with everybody. If things went hopelessly wrong, to the extent of its being discovered by the Opposition, they could be disavowed and dumped —ruthlessly—which is what has happened. Again, we do not want to go into any of the details of all that, any more than we have to, but we have to take some notice of the statement on the north which the Taoiseach made at the opening of the confidence debate. He said: The first and major item of national policy since its inception was to secure the re-unification of the country by peaceful means. I am satisfied we are making progress in this direction along the right road. [626] I am confident we shall make further progress in the months and years ahead. Anyone who has been in touch, in any degree, with the real situation in the north in recent months cannot help but be sickened by the bland complacency of that kind of statement about a terrible situation. It is true that some progress has been made in the north, some real progress, but not so much in the direction of re-unification— which is not precisely around the corner, whatever impression the Taoiseach gives to his supporters—as in the direction of the implementation of civic equality for the minority in Northern Ireland. But, for that reality of progress —which I fully admit is there— towards civil equality, the Taoiseach and his Government and the Fianna Fáil Party, which the Taoiseach styles 'the party of re-unification', deserves no credit at all. They did nothing to bring that about. Nor do any of the rest of us here, so far as I know, deserve any credit. The credit for that belongs exclusively to the civil rights movement in the north itself, including a number of young people—left-wing students and others—at whom our Government here always looked askance and which our Government tried to push aside for the benefit of their own cronies in the course of their few intermittent, disco-ordinated attempts to intervene in the situation up there. No, the Government have no responsibility and deserve no credit for the progress made in the only direction in which progress has been made, which is towards civic equality, in the north. But, where the Government began to be active was in the period after the civil rights movement had won the basis for victory—which is all it did win. Then the Government contribution at that stage, after August, was essentially what the people have seen in the sordid mess revealed by the arms trial. There was a series of contradictory statements, speaking out of both sides of their mouths, through the Taoiseach and Deputy Blaney, combined with that pathetic medley of cloak-and-dagger clowning which the arms trial revealed. Politically, through that sinister organ, The Voice of the[627]North, those members of the Government who were left in charge of these activities by the Taoiseach's cultivated neglect contributed to the recrudescence of a particular kind and flavour of IRA activity selected by them from the gamut available of those forms of activity. The effect of the Government's activities and also the effect of the subsequent revelations, which are not yet finished I think, of what their activities had been in the north was to intensify Protestant fears, increase the backlash and hasten a drift towards sectarian civil war. Some Protestants were trying to cool this situation and to bring about better relations between the two communities —an enterprise, perhaps, of particular hazard for Protestants of goodwill in Belfast, at least at the present time. I have met some of these people. I talk with them quite often and I know the feeling of sick despair they have at some of the revelations of the arms trial, revelations which, it seemed to them, undid all their credibility with the fellow members of their community, with people who were inclined always to suspect Catholics, to believe Catholics could not be relied on, that they said one thing and did another. These other Protestants who are trying to bring about better relations found their efforts shattered and smashed down by the picture revealed by the arms trial and by the emergence of such a character as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Today the real situation in the north is one of which no responsible man here has the right to speak with the kind of complacency the Taoiseach showed at the beginning of this debate. The real situation which, so far as I know, the Taoiseach has never seen— his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, got a brief glimpse of one section of it in the Falls Road but I think the Taoiseach has never seen it at all—is briefly that British troops hold peace lines between two sections of Irishmen. If those troops had been withdrawn this summer in Derry, for example, there would have been a holocaust. There would be a holocaust if they were withdrawn now. [628] The life of the two principal cities in the north, Derry and Belfast, is at present in a sort of iron lung. Some kind of civil life continues to throb painfully with the artificial aid of British armour and British troops. The Government are certainly not solely and not even mainly responsible for that situation, but they have seriously contributed to the exacerbation of the feelings and, above all, the suspicions and fears which lie behind that situation. The Taoiseach thinks he can calm these feelings with smooth and peaceful language, which he issues fairly steadily at the United Nations and elsewhere. Unfortunately, this is not just a question of language, of the good word which one uses, but how the words are matched by the record of action. Against the record of the action of the Taoiseach's Government, and particularly his first Government, the Taoiseach's words do not sound too good at all. In the north rather few people—and this is a point which draws together the two communities—in either community believe a word the Taoiseach says, or the members of his Government. Furthermore, I think this Dáil will discredit itself in the eyes of both communities there if it should vote confidence in the Taoiseach tonight. The Taoiseach talks about being the second guarantor of the situation in the north or of the rights of the minority. He guarantees to the minority there that promises made to them by Chichester-Clarke's Government and by the British Government will be carried out. This is the second guarantee they have of that. This script is in their hands. How can he guarantee anything of the sort? How can he plausibly represent himself to anybody as guaranteeing anything? A guarantee implies that if what you are vouching for does not take place you will do something. What could the Taoiseach do if the promises which were made to the minority in the north were not carried out? They may be carried out they may not be carried out. We have no means of knowing. Even those immediately concerned cannot be sure, because events in the north are at the [629] mercy of the actions of a few men. We asked him that question here in the Dáil. We asked how he could guarantee these things and we got no clear answer. We just got something to the effect that he would implement the guarantee in his own way. We know what his own way is: to go on television again and make another 'cannot stand idly by' speech. That is the only guarantee which this pathetic second guarantor can really provide because the plain fact is that the minority in the north, and the majority, are outside the Taoiseach's jurisdiction. The Taoiseach's record has proved he is not able even to guarantee events which happen within his jurisdiction which is quite pardonable or, which is not pardonable, to guarantee the actions of the Government which he himself heads and for which he bears responsibility and in relation to which I think we must conclude he acts irresponsibly. The Taoiseach's record on the north and his absurd smugness about the situation there, which he has never even seen as it is now, are major reasons for withholding our confidence in him, but there are other reasons closely associated with this question of the north. If the Taoiseach and his Government succeed in their present project of clinging to office they must do so by the cynical and conscienceless votes of people who are known to despise and reject the peaceful policy in relation to the north which the Taoiseach publicly professes and which they have equally publicly, some of them, condemned. We do not know what will happen tonight. He may get these votes or most of them. No doubt he will. Like Professor Pavlov's famous dogs, all Fianna Fáil Deputies are conditioned to salivate in a particular way at the sound of a given bell. If he does get the votes—let us grant that he will get them—the continuity of his peaceful policy depends on the votes of people who are known to reject that policy and often openly too. It follows that if through developments in the north this peaceful policy comes under any heavy strain, the basis of the Taoiseach's political power, if he still has any then, would also come under heavy strain through the threat [630] of defections. Knowing the record of his past, we can see how quickly a completely new and dangerous approach might result from these conditions. We might hear of a sudden escalation suddenly over television the old peaceful policy was gone because the balance inside Fianna Fáil had changed and it was: 'Pour it on'. It follows from this that the Fianna Fáil Government, however specific and reassuring their language may sound at present, are and remain a dangerous organisation to be in control of this country and to be dabbling at the same time in guaranteeing what they have no power to guarantee: the nature and trend of developments in the north. I wish to choose my words as carefully as I can here but it is a fact that, even since the Taoiseach spoke at the beginning of this confidence debate, there has been a serious deterioration in the situation in the north. The Taoiseach, who at first called the presence of the British troops there unacceptable, now admits what is the tragic, unfortunate, sad fact that these troops are at present all that is keeping the two communities there, or many of their members, from rending one another. Some people—I do not know who they are—have now started shooting at those troops and the danger arises that, when the troops shoot back, if they do shoot back, people will be killed, there will be martyrs, there will be funerals, there will be more of these shots fired over graves and the temperature will go up. If the temperature does go up we know what section of the Fianna Fáil Party will profit. I will say no more about that but it is or could be an exceedingly sinister feature in a situation about which the Taoiseach is talking in a misleadingly reassuring way. A word now about the so-called rebels or ex-rebels or pseudo-rebels or whatever they are in the Fianna Fáil Party. I have already referred to Deputy Boland. I do not want to refer to him again. Any comment I make on pseudo-rebels does not apply to him. He is beyond the reach of such remarks. He has put himself beyond that by his courage and his honesty in his statements here. These men—I [631] am speaking of the others, not of Deputy Boland and there may be other exceptions too — if there are I ask them also—that is to say people who are not going to vote confidence in the Taoiseach—to take my remarks as not applying to them—these men, including the four historical pillars of the Taoiseach's historic last Government, have been presenting themselves as stern, unbending republicans. Some of them, in another part of this building last night, were singing loudly: The Bould Fenian Men. They are going to go through that Lobby tonight like meek Fenian sheep. They seem to have acquired a certain following, some of them anyway, among some who are in fact republicans in the ordinary acceptance of that word though many republicans of course also reject them. Those of them who go through the 'Tá' Lobby tonight are about to lose whatever genuine republican following they may have had up to now. Republicans of strict observance, of whom I know some, may be perhaps narrow-minded, unreasonable, unrealistic people sometimes, and have other faults, but one quality which they most certainly do have is a demanding code of personal honour. They are not given to saying one thing and meaning another, to the tactics of the knowing wink and the tongue-in-cheek. The old idea of 'Beart de réir ár mbriathar' is meaningful to them as well as to others not of their persuasion. But these sentiments do not find a very widespread echo among the members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party though they do, I think among Fianna Fáil supporters, people who traditionally support Fianna Fáil. Deputy Cosgrave in his forceful remarks during the debate referred, in connection with the lack of truthfulness at present being displayed on those benches, to the 'empty formula', the phrase used to designate whatever it was that happened when a certain book was signed in 1927. I do not know what Deputy Cosgrave may feel but I think it is possible to feel considerable respect for the generation that had to go through the agony of that choice, taking that oath, if they did take it, signing that book, which at any rate they did, [632] but I think the exercise of that choice has left a sort of damnosa hereditas to the Fianna Fáil Party in its second and third generations. The older generation knew the agony of the choice they knew what it represented they knew what they felt to be its necessity. However, for some of the younger ones, for some of the subsequent generations, the empty formula lesson was understood more or less like this: the wise guy may do anything, say anything, sign anything in order to get into power and hold on to power. I do not believe at all that that is what Mr. de Valera meant when he signed that book or what he felt but I do believe it is what has passed on as patrimony, intellectual and moral patrimony, to some members of that party. When Deputy Haughey, followed by the faithful and long suffering Deputy Timmons, goes through the 'Tá' Lobby tonight to vote his confidence in the Taoiseach and in Deputy Gibbons and the others he will, I believe, be forfeiting the respect not only of any republican sympathisers he may have but of all the disinterested support he has so far retained. I have heard Deputy Haughey say in this House in his lordly way: 'I hate phoniness.' Tonight when he goes through that 'Tá' Lobby at the Taoiseach's command he will be saying to the public: 'I am a phoney' as loud and clear as if he were bearing a placard with that legend. The judge in the arms trial said that there was a total conflict between the evidence of Deputy Haughey and that of Deputy Gibbons, that there was no way of resolving this because they were both speaking on matters within their knowledge. One or the other was a perjurer. That was from the judge. I am not responsible for it. When Deputy Haughey goes through that lobby to vote confidence in Deputy Gibbons either a perjurer will be voting that confidence or Deputy Haughey, since he knows the facts, will be voting confidence in a perjurer. That is the situation. We do not yet know what Deputy Blaney will do. He will tell us, we hope, shortly. We do know that in commenting on an assertion by Deputy Gibbons which I mentioned [633] earlier about craziness Deputy Blaney stressed his own honesty, comparing it by implication with the reverse of that quality attributed by him to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. What then would be left of Deputy Blaney's honesty if he were to vote, for any reason, confidence in Deputy Gibbons? We do not know. We will know soon. Of the rest of the rebels it is not worth while speaking. They began by strutting and they are now about to crawl. It is not a pleasant spectacle and there is no need to linger on it. If there are any exceptions we shall know about them soon. The point we must make clear is that the accumulated discredit of all these sordid proceedings lies at the doorstep of the Taoiseach and of all his colleagues. If they continue to hold office it will be by virtue of those flagrantly insincere professions of confidence extorted by the fear of losing seats. By acting in this way, all of them, all of these furtively hostile factions of the Fianna Fáil Party brought this Parliament into contempt and damaged our country in its own eyes and in the eyes of any outsiders, and there are some, who have troubled to watch what is happening. It may be—I have not given up hope yet—that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste behind their self-satisfied masks are conscious of the truth—I think they are conscious of it—of much that has been said in this debate by those of us who openly tell them that we have no confidence in them and tell them that they deserve no confidence and tell them why and tell them also that they have not got the support of an uncoerced majority in this Dáil and would not get the support of a free Dáil tonight. If this is so they will go to the country as soon as this debate is over whatever the result of the voting. I think they may do that. Just before concluding may I tell a little story from an exotic part of the world, the Congo, to which some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies are fond of alluding on some occasions. It is an historic and true story, the story of a man who voted confidence in a man in whom he did not believe and what [634] happened to him. Some years ago in the Congo there was a 'bold Fenian man' in the guise of a rebel and his name was Pierre Mulele. He was beaten by President Mobutu, the resourceful, astute, ruthless head of that far and inscrutable country, and he ran away. Then President Mobutu said to everybody: 'Let us forget all this. Let us have unity. Let us forget past rebellions, hard words exchanged, blows exchanged. Let us all be Congolese together.' He promised amnesty to those who would accept him, to those who would vote confidence in his regime, in the President of the Congo and the members of his government. So, poor Mr. Mulele, who had gone into hiding in Brazzaville, came back across the river to Leopoldville, Kinshasa, in 1968 and he was welcomed hospitably by President Mobutu's friends. This is a true story. They welcomed him hospitably and they asked him if he would make a speech. He made a speech and it was one in which he declared his confidence in President Mobutu. He said that bad things had happened in the past but the thing now was unity, unity of President Mobutu's party, unity of the country behind it, and they would all go on shoulder to shoulder, back to back and so on. He made this rather lavish speech. Then, when the television cameras had been taken away he was arrested by the troops of President Mobutu and was brought before a military tribunal which that night sentenced him to death. He was hanged on the following day. Now, events in the Congo proceed perhaps more briskly than they are yet allowed to proceed here but the political analogy is sound. I have heard Fianna Fáil Deputies say in some of their more unguarded moments what they intended to do with Deputy Haughey once he had voted the confidence. They said they would do something which I cannot tell you about here because it would be contrary to Parliamentary etiquette and because it might bring a blush to the cheek of people like Deputy Dowling. It might be interesting but we cannot do that. But, to vote a hollow vote of confidence, to vote it insincerely is, I would suggest to some [635] of those gentlemen—it may be an argument which would tell with them more than some other argument— politically dangerous for them as well as in other ways discreditable. The Government should go to the country whether or not they get this vote of confidence tonight. As long as they hold office by the hollow and cynical majority they may get tonight the foundation of their power will be rotten and dangerous and our democracy is turned into a mockery. We are asked what is the alternative. I shall only say this: If the people of this country in the next general election show that they demand an alternative to Fianna Fáil then it becomes the duty of the present Opposition to furnish that alternative.",04/11/1970,19,2623,2624,believe it is what has passed on as patrimony intellectual and moral patrimony to some members of that party When,Deputy Haughey,followed by the faithful and long suffering Deputy Timmons goes through the Tá Lobby tonight to vote his confidence in,Deputy Haughey,1443087_18,,believe it is what has passed on as patrimony intellectual and moral patrimony to some members of that party When Deputy Haughey followed by the faithful and long suffering Deputy Timmons goes through the Tá Lobby tonight to vote his confidence in,believe it is what has passed on as patrimony intellectual and moral patrimony to some members of that party When followed by the faithful and long suffering Deputy Timmons goes through the Tá Lobby tonight to vote his confidence in,text878,1,4,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.221359436,0.005533986,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.788788789,0.734734735,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know it annoys him to have to do so because he regards it as a disruption of his work. However, I wish to put to him a point made by Liam Kelleher, director general of the CIF, on 9 January in respect of the infrastructural component of the national development plan which is pertinent to the question in my name. I am in order putting a question on this matter and if the Taoiseach is still serving as chairperson of the cross-departmental committee to which the questions refer, he remains the person responsible for this matter. While he does not like the title, I must remind him that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, described him as project manager of the national development plan when it was launched some time ago. Will the Taoiseach comment on the two points made by Mr. Kelleher on 9 January? The first was to the effect that the delivery of infrastructural programmes is already falling significantly behind schedule, that this is not the fault of the construction industry, that the delays are taking place in the pre-construction phases of development, namely, on the Government side. Mr. Kelleher also stated it is now obvious that a funding gap is beginning to emerge in the national development plan and that if the infrastructural targets in the plan are to be realised, additional funding will be required over and above the figures proposed in the plan.",06/02/2002,28,131,132,this matter While he does not like the title I must remind him that the Minister for Health and Children,Deputy Martin,described him as project manager of the national development plan when it was launched some time ago Will the Taoiseach,Deputy Martin,3264778_1,,this matter While he does not like the title I must remind him that the Minister for Health and Children Deputy Martin described him as project manager of the national development plan when it was launched some time ago Will the Taoiseach,this matter While he does not like the title I must remind him that the Minister for Health and Children described him as project manager of the national development plan when it was launched some time ago Will the Taoiseach,text548,0,1,1,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,-0.039528471,-0.000988212,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.294294294,0.296296296,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1967912,488,9,50,"Financial Resolutions, 1981. - Financial Resolution No. 9: General (Resumed).",05/02/1981,Mr. Paddy Harte,Fine Gael,Donegal North-East,"Deputy Smith, apparently, knows more about the politics of the [1130] majority and the minority of potato growers in Donegal than I do. I am not sure if it was the majority or the minority but if what Deputy Smith says is correct, little thanks the Government have given them in the budget. They have ignored their pleas and they have been lobbying Ministers, Deputies and county councillors. We have had deputations here and my doorbell never stops ringing with hard pressed farmers seeking, not begging help, saying they have grown the potatoes, produced the crop and put the effort into it. The whole thing has gone wrong and they have been let down. That is the message they are trying to get across. Deputy Smith says the majority of them voted for his party candidate in the by-election. Shame on Deputy Smith for admitting it and supporting a party that has done so little in return. I am not sure what the economic position is with the different families that traditionally grow potatoes, people who are recognised as being agricultural experts in the potato industry. They may have little nest eggs that will take them over the present economic difficulties. They may not. Whatever the position is, the Government is in default for doing nothing about it. £250,000 has been described as a gob stopper to keep noisy farmers quiet in County Donegal, to get them off the backs of Fianna Fáil Deputies, Senators and county councillors. They want them off their backs because they are annoying them. They did not annoy them last year or any previous year. They are doing it this year because they are justified in so doing and the sooner the Government and young men like Deputy Smith, who has a responsibility in the agricultural industry, does something about it, the better. I heard Government speakers talk about the tourist industry and point to the fact that, because of our low currency rate, many people will be coming from Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Republic and we are in for a boom period. I hope they are right. The people to whom I have been talking in the North of Ireland do not see it that way. Those people are from both traditions. They are just Irish people who live north of the [1131] Border and where they go on Sunday morning is of little concern. They are not talking about coming to the Republic on their summer holidays because our punt is now 74p against sterling. They will come across the Border for a meal, which is now 26 per cent cheaper in Southern hotels, but the people in the North can now go to the Mediterranean, to other European countries and to Florida for three-quarters of the price they paid last year. That is the advantage. I hope the predictions and forecasts made by the tourist board and the optimism shared by the Government comes to pass but I have grave doubts. In County Donegal, which has so many people unemployed, living in bad houses, paying telephone charges for a telephone system that does not work, having to use bad roads and an inadequate public transport service, there is nothing in the budget to suggest that the support which the present Government have had in the past will continue. There are now almost 2,000 families in need of rehousing in County Donegal. There is no hope whatsoever for them in the budget. The Government are going to give money to the building tycoons. We know them, we see them in the corridors of power, talking in the lobbies of Leinster House outside the Chamber. We recognise them mostly by the suits and shoes they wear and the gold rings on their fingers. As I said earlier, they were the backbone of the Tacateers of the sixties and early seventies — mostly the sixties. The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, to his credit, got rid of the leeches of political life. They are people who have more control over the destiny of the nation than people elected, the faceless men in public life, the guys who can lobby the Ministers, twist their arms, to get things done and who do not have to stand before the general public at election time. He is there all the time. If there is a change of Government, it will not be too long before he changes his allegiance. I wonder how many of them would be lobbying Coalition Government Ministers if we had won the last election. Since 1932, Fianna Fáil have never been beaten [1132] twice in a general election. There are leeches who persuade Government Ministers that building too many local authority houses, floods the market with new houses. The Government, therefore, do not proceed to build local authority houses in sufficient numbers to meet the needs of people living in bad houses. If they did, there would be too many houses on the market and the tycoons in the building industry who are so closely embedded in the Fianna Fáil party, would not be given as much money for the houses they build. If this is unfair criticism, someone can paint another picture but that is how I see it. If ever a Government stands condemned this Fianna Fáil administration does. In the last two or three years one of the major decisions taken by the Government, under a different leader but collective responsibility makes them all responsible, was to join the EMS. We joined the EMS because we were told it represented a stable currency. We joined it because sterling was falling and was getting dangerously low. We joined it because we all wanted to be good Europeans and we were told so but we joined it blindly and the people who knew the facts—I mention Deputy Lynch as Taoiseach, Deputy Colley who was Tánaiste, Deputy O'Donoghue who was Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the other members of the Cabinet—did not inform the Government backbenchers of the true nature of the risks we were taking in joining the EMS. The Opposition were not informed of the true position. I could not figure out what was happening but I was tempted by the fact that I believed Ireland should be part of Europe. Therefore, the carrot of a European monetary system appealed to me as, undoubtedly, it did to other members of my party and Government backbenchers. It is now time that we admitted that the EMS, a well-intentioned decision, has gone wrong. While some people in Irish Society have benefited it must be admitted that a greater number have not. I should like to give some details about this and argue the point which has a political base. In the sixties the late Seán [1133] Lemass argued that if Irish unity was to be a real thing, was to be on the cards or considered by people north of the Border there would have to be social welfare benefits here equal to their own. The gap was being narrowly bridged until we broke with sterling and joined the EMS. Now there is a 26 per cent difference. If the Government do not understand what I am talking about they should take into consideration the case I shall put forward. Two people who worked in Northern Ireland have now moved to the Republic and are being paid a British old age or retirement pension and have a great benefit. They would tell any Member that they are living in the lap of luxury now, that times were never so good. However, if one approached a person who served this part of Ireland over a number of years, a retired civil servant, Army officer or ordinary soldier, a retired garda, or their widows, and are now living in Northern Ireland one would be told that they are worse off. In fact, they are poverty stricken because their pensions have been cut by 28 per cent. Weekly I get telephone calls from people who are living in Northern Ireland on behalf of widows of civil servants now living in Derry, Omagh or Coleraine. It is pointed out to me that they can no longer live on their pension and I am asked if anything can be done about converting the punt into sterling for them. It is only out of despair that such requests are made because in most cases they are aware of the answer. What the late Seán Lémass forecast and tried to achieve in the sixties his son-in-law, Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, has undone by a stroke of the pen. I have been informed that had we remained linked to sterling our repayments on foreign borrowing would be 26 per cent less and we would have saved about £170 million per year. I should like to give an example of the position faced by a constituent of mine although I accept that there are many in this position. A young dynamic farmer, on this side, who must get up at 6. 30 in the morning and does not finish work until 10. 30 p. m., by tradition had his bank account in Northern Ireland. Naturally, [1134] a farmer's bank account is mostly in the overdraft situation. The young person concerned had an overdraft of £120,000 and now must repay that in sterling. It is now going to cost him £40,000 more to do so. He is paying 15 or 16 per cent interest not on £120,000 but on £160,000. That is one of the tragedies of us having joined the EMS and there is no way out of it. It is no good saying that that young farmer should have transferred his money to the Republic because it would be in contradiction with the Fianna Fáil Party's position of being anti-partitionist to ignore the Border. The State has also done the same thing. The State borrowed money abroad that would have cost us 26 per cent less had we stayed with sterling. The public external debt by the end of 1980 was £2,900 million with between £700 million and £1,000 million due in 1981. External reserves are £1,340 million and if our currency falls 11 per cent the true cost of repaying those loans escalates sharply. The interest rate could become 30 per cent or even more. We have imported inflation. Our imports last year amounted to £5,425 million while our exports amounted to £4,134 million. The difference is nearly £1,300 million. Imports from Britain and Northern Ireland amounted to £2,757 million, up from £2,408 million the previous year. Exports there were £1,768 million, up from £1,624 million. The rise in imports was 14 per cent and exports 9 per cent. There is no evidence from that that the fall in our currency has helped us to win a larger share of the British or Northern Ireland Markets. In fact, we have not benefited as forecast. The reason I say that the whole thing has gone wrong is that the forecast of the Government on entry to the EMS was that our currency would get stronger and our difficulty was going to be to compete on the British market. Well, if we have got stability in our currency we have it with countries with whom we do not do business but we have instability with Northern Ireland and Great Britain with whom we do business. It shocks me and I believe that as a result Irish unity is back a hundred years. [1135] On the question of prices, I believe that, thanks to Britain's successful policy of keeping sterling high, inflation is expected to halve there this year to below 10 per cent. Already it is down from 20 to 15 per cent whereas we are at 18-19 per cent. Because of our weak currency, prices will rise faster this year. The economic background to the budget admits an average fall of 11 per cent in our currency last year. This will add at least 5 per cent to domestic inflation. With sterling the reverse would have been the position. Admittedly some businesses have done well and that is to be welcomed, as most of these businesses were not doing well because of policies pursued by this and past Fianna Fáil Governments. In Border towns because of the tariff barriers and because of economic differences, mostly to the disadvantage of people in the Republic, people had the advantage of going into Northern Ireland to shop at the expense of traders in the Border towns. By mistake it has been reversed and the Border towns are now benefiting because of the currency difference, not because of the economic policy of Fianna Fáil, not because of the forecasting of Fianna Fáil when we joined the EMS, because their forecast was that our £ was going to be stronger, but more in spite of what Fianna Fáil planned. What are the effects? Cattle dealers in the Republic now cannot compete with cattle dealers from Northern Ireland. Abattoirs and meat factories are closing in the Republic because Northern buyers are coming down here and paying sterling for our cattle. Therefore, there is a net gain and a greater net loss. Economic convulsion is happening in this State and we are not aware of it because of the bad planning. There is also the terrible difficulty that when we talk about Irish unity nobody here now can afford to go to Northern Ireland on holidays. It is coming this way. That might be a good thing, but no one is going from the State. One of the faults that we identify is that not enough of us are going up to see how they live up there. One thing I must say before I conclude is that if we were with sterling the timber [1136] we import from Scandinavia would be 26 per cent less. Our oil which we buy with dollars would be 26 per cent less. Our petrol, diesel, steel and coal which we import from Poland, the US and Britain, and foreign motor cars, would all be getting cheaper by 26 per cent. On that score I am told that British cars are being subsidised by their manufacturers because they would be priced out of existence if we were paying sterling for them. Deputy Callanan will appreciate that 98 per cent of our farm machinery is imported. All of that would be 26 per cent less if we were with sterling as also would be soya beans and animal feedstuffs. The farmers tell me that they are selling in IR£ and buying in sterling and this is causing havoc. The only way that our joining the EMS can be undone is if we find oil off the west coast, if the British economy starts falling or if the EMS starts rising. Then our economy might be levelled off with that of Britain. Sterling has appreciated because of North Sea oil and because of high interest rates. Our leaving sterling meant that we were saying that we did not want to share Britain's North Sea oil and we did not want to benefit from high interest rates. Those people who do not listen to what I am saying will say that we are better off the way we are, that the £ sterling is too dear. If the £ sterling is too dear what they are really saying is that we had better not find oil off our west coast because the IR£ might then become too dear, so let us stay out here. That is an irrational argument. Let me conclude by saying definitely —because it is the kernel of Irish politics and of what has me in public life—that any Government who have the political unity of Ireland as the cornerstone of their political philosophy and who have preached the unity of Ireland with constant regularity since their foundation, any Government who with their supporters believe that they and they alone are the true United Ireland party any party who do all these things and do not produce and support economic, monetary and social policies consistent with that basic political position, but instead produce and support badly thought out policies [1137] which disrupt and interfere with the rights of Irish people on both sides of the Border to trade and deal with each other on terms which are fair and equal to each other, are in fact a partitionist party who forfeit the right to speak about Irish unity. Fianna Fáil, past and present, have built economic partition between North and South and have introduced and supported economic policies which have discriminated against one-third of the Irish people because one-third of us live north of the Border and that discrimination is against Nationalist as well as Unionist. It may have been intended to be against British goods, but that is what it has meant to Irish people living north of the Border. The currency partition compounds all the mistakes and errors of this and past Governments. Never before has Partition been so complete. That is the net result of badly thought out policies. Whether it is palatable or otherwise, it is something I believe deeply and I have yet to be convinced that I am wrong. If you preach the political unity of Ireland your economic policies, your currency policies, your financial policy, your educational policies, your agricultural policies and every other policy must be consistent with the basic political philosophy, otherwise you are talking a lot of humbug. It was summarised in a fireside chat in a house in Donegal that I visited last Sunday evening when a young man said to me, 'Paddy, the Fianna Fáil Party have no commitment to Irish unity. They are like the young boy who went to the confessional and told so many sins that the priest said to him, ‘Son, do you want to go to Heaven?’ and he said, ‘I do, Father, but not yet.'’ It is the same with Fianna Fáil. They want a united Ireland — but not yet. They want to commit all the sins against it and hope at some stage that they will be forgiven by everybody and that by some freak of chance they will become the party that will unite the Irish people.",05/02/1981,21,293,294,doing it this year because they are justified in so doing and the sooner the Government and young men like,Deputy Smith,who has a responsibility in the agricultural industry does something about it the better I heard Government speakers talk about,Deputy Smith,1967912_6,,doing it this year because they are justified in so doing and the sooner the Government and young men like Deputy Smith who has a responsibility in the agricultural industry does something about it the better I heard Government speakers talk about,doing it this year because they are justified in so doing and the sooner the Government and young men like who has a responsibility in the agricultural industry does something about it the better I heard Government speakers talk about,text416,0,4,0,0,40,0.1,4,2.197224577,0.054930614,0.332039154,0.008300979,0.94994995,0.974974975,0.978978979,0.923923924,0.88988989,0.837837838,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3619514,809,9,138,Financial Resolution No. 5: General (Resumed).,08/12/2005,Mr. Denis Naughten,Fine Gael,Longford-Roscommon,"I wish to share time with Deputies Twomey and Enright. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget. It is an important opportunity to highlight significant weaknesses from the point of view of agriculture. We are now in an environment structured by the CAP reform, the WTO negotiations, the impending nitrates action plan and the impending closure of our sugar industry. I had hoped that in that context we would have seen some positive developments from the Minister for Finance in his presentation yesterday, but he ignored the entire area. I will give an example of where I thought some progress might have been made. We are currently spending 4% of our total research and development budget on the food industry. The food industry in this country is worth more than €11 billion annually. It accounts for 24% of our exports, yet just 4% of the total R&D budget is spent in that area, with nothing done to address the deficit. Agricultural incomes have collapsed. Last week, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, was pictured all over the place with numerous lovely cheques from the single farm payment scheme, but in reality the average farmer in Ireland will have an income this year of €15,557. That includes the single farm payment. Out of that, input costs come to €15,478, and the Government’s stealth charges put in place over the past few years come to an another €3,978. Based on those figures, what the single farm payment amounts to for the average Irish farmer is a nett loss of €75 per week. Farmers are not benefitting from the single farm payment. Yesterday, the Minister for Agriculture and Food paid lip service to the issue of agriculture. One key objective raised by all the farming organisations was that of farm consolidation. Some 30% of farms are in four or more parcels of land and for the past few years farming organisations have been pleading for the introduction of roll-over relief in relation to stamp duty for farmers who want to improve their efficiency and consolidate their farms. No recognition was given to that yesterday. We have the crazy situation where Deputy Parlon, when leader of the IFA, negotiated a deal with the Government with regard to the compulsory purchase of land whereby farmers would get roll-over relief in regard to capital gains tax. The moment Deputy Parlon joined the Government benches, after the election, he and the Minister for Finance rescinded the deal made. Farmers are now being taxed on the compulsory purchase of land by the State with regard to our motorways around the country. A gun is being put to their [99]heads and the Government then takes 20% in tax off the compulsory purchase price given. That is an immoral, disgraceful situation, and a spineless Minister is not prepared to even discuss the matter in the House. That is the reality farmers must deal with on a daily basis. The issue of farm consolidation was completely ignored in the budget even though the Minister paid lip service to agriculture. I will give an example of what the budget means to farmers. A progressive farmer with an income of €30,000 per annum and two children over the age of six has benefitted from the budget by €5 weekly. Admittedly, if he had two children under the age of six, he would benefit by €33 weekly. However, the Minister also made an announcement yesterday with regard to the PAYE tax credit. This has increased by €220 to €1,490, which means farmers are losing that additional tax credit because they happen to be self-employed. They are losing out compared to other taxpayers within the economy and no recognition has been given to their income loss and the dramatic fall-off in income which has taken place over the past number of years. Farm families and home carers did not get one extra cent from this Government. The tax credit of €770 was not touched in the budget. Incentives were given with regard to betting tax but there was nothing for the housewife who decides to stay at home and care for her children. No recognition was afforded her, nor was there any recognition for those caring for the elderly with regard to the tax system. They were completely ignored. It is a great misfortune that we do not recognise women who work on farms and in homes in rural Ireland. Many of them work in partnership with their husbands. In some cases they own the land, but because tax and PRSI are paid by the husband, no recognition is given to these women with regard to social welfare. That is wrong and needs to be examined. No recognition was given to them in this budget with regard to the home carer’s credit. Anyone with children and unfortunate enough to be on social welfare, whether it be farm assist or any other form of welfare, gets no recognition in terms of the child dependant allowance. It did not increase by one cent in this budget, even though this Government is supposed to be prioritising children in the budget. Those in the most marginal elements of society were completely ignored compared to other earners in society. There was a silver lining with regard to biofuels. The Minister for Agriculture and Food was rushing out of the Chamber yesterday, tripping over herself to welcome that. However, in order to avail of the new biofuels package, one has to convert vehicles, and many people will not go to the cost of converting their vehicles to take biofuels. We should have introduced a measure whereby one could blend biofuels into existing fuels. In Austria, for example, 5% of the biofuel [100]produced is mixed with petrol and 2% with diesel. Such products could be used in all vehicles and would ensure a major take-up of biofuels. It would also provide the incentive to farmers to grow biofuels. Such a measure was not introduced in this budget, however. Instead, more money was taken from farmers in terms of the VAT refund for non-VAT registered farmers. Last year, the Taoiseach gave a commitment that this provision would be reviewed this year. However, he has turned his back on farmers in this regard. Input costs have risen, returns have fallen and farmers are losing at least 1% in this area. Based on their current tight margins, this will have a significant impact. The measures regarding stamp duty for young trained farmers are a positive development. There are many more anomalies, however, in inheritance tax and stamp duty which have not been addressed. The issue of land leases was examined but inter-family land leases are ignored. Many farming families lease their land to a son or daughter but no recognition was given to this issue by the Minister for Finance. He clapped himself on the back about the €1 billion multi-annual budget for farm investment. The reality, however, is that this €1 billion budget will be taken up in implementing the prescriptive rules laid down under the nitrates directive. It will not lead to any additional efficiency but rather to additional costs and regulations for farmers and the possibility of being prosecuted for using one bag of fertiliser more than set out in the rules. That is what has been proposed by the Government and what it plans to implement. There is very little in this for farmers and farming families. The Minister for Finance yesterday announced €110 million for services for the elderly. This is a far cry from the €160 million that has been lost on the PPARS system. Three weeks ago, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children came to County Roscommon and paid lip-service to the issue of services for the elderly there. We cannot recruit the specialist staff to provide these services no matter how much money is allocated. An allocation of €110 million or even €1 billion is no good unless we address the issue of recruitment. When the Tánaiste visited Roscommon she also made the announcement that she would appoint a third consultant physician at the county hospital in Roscommon. However, she did not inform us that it would be a temporary appointment for a six-month period. The Government adopts a deceptive attitude on these and other issues. It speaks with a forked tongue about every commitment it has given and then goes behind our backs and undermines what has already been delivered. This is a spineless Government that is prepared to make announcements but not to implement and deliver its promises. A prime example of this is the guillotine hanging over the accident and emergency unit at the county [101]hospital in Roscommon. The Tánaiste will not be back there for some time.",08/12/2005,29,398,399,to the compulsory purchase of land whereby farmers would get roll-over relief in regard to capital gains tax The moment,Deputy Parlon,joined the Government benches after the election he and the Minister for Finance rescinded the deal made Farmers are now,Deputy Parlon,3619514_3,,to the compulsory purchase of land whereby farmers would get roll-over relief in regard to capital gains tax The moment Deputy Parlon joined the Government benches after the election he and the Minister for Finance rescinded the deal made Farmers are now,to the compulsory purchase of land whereby farmers would get roll-over relief in regard to capital gains tax The moment joined the Government benches after the election he and the Minister for Finance rescinded the deal made Farmers are now,text827,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,0.304538836,0.007613471,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.875875876,0.824824825,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4216562,1028,9,90,Criminal Justice Bill 2011: Report and Final Stages,14/07/2011,Mr. Alan Shatter,Fine Gael,Dublin South,"I move amendment No. 4. In page 27, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following: [754]20.—(1) An employer shall not penalise or threaten penalisation against an employee, or cause or permit any other person to penalise or threaten penalisation against an employee— (a) for making a disclosure or for giving evidence in relation to such disclosure in any proceedings relating to a relevant offence, or (b) for giving notice of his or her intention to do so. (2) Schedule 2* shall have effect in relation to an alleged contravention of subsection (1). (3) Nothing in paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the definition of 'penalisation' shall be construed in a manner which prevents an employer from— (a) ensuring that the business concerned is carried on in an efficient manner, or (b) taking any action required for economic, technical or organisational reasons. (4) (a) If penalisation of an employee, in contravention of subsection (1), constitutes a dismissal of the employee, as referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of 'penalisation', the employee (or, in the case of an employee who has not reached the age of 18 years, the employee’s parent or guardian, with his or her consent) may institute proceedings in respect of that dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 or to recover damages at common law for wrongful dismissal and, if the employee or his or her parent or guardian, as the case may be, does so, a complaint of such dismissal may not be presented to a rights commissioner under paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2. (b) If an employee (or, in the case of an employee who has not reached the age of 18 years, the employee’s parent or guardian, with his or her consent) presents a complaint to a rights commissioner under paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 in respect of a dismissal referred to in paragraph (a), the employee or his or her parent or guardian, as the case may be, may not institute proceedings in respect of that dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 or to recover damages at common law for wrongful dismissal. (5) For the purposes of this section and Schedule 2, a reference to 'dismissal' includes— (a) a dismissal within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007, and (b) a dismissal wholly or partly for or connected with the purpose of the avoidance of a fixed-term contract being deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration under section 9(3) of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. (6) In this section, section 21 and in Schedule 2— 'contract of employment' means a contract of employment or of service or of apprenticeship, whether the contract is express or implied and, if express, whether it is oral or in writing 'disclosure', in relation to an employee, means a disclosure by the employee to a member of the Garda Síochána of information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in — (a) preventing the commission by any other person of a relevant offence, or [755](b) securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for a relevant offence 'employee' means a person who has entered into or works under (or, where the employment has ceased, entered into or worked under) a contract of employment and references, in relation to an employer, to an employee shall be construed as references to an employee employed by that employer 'employer', in relation to an employee, means the person with whom the employee has entered into or for whom the employee works under (or, where the employment has ceased, entered into or worked under) a contract of employment, and includes— (a) a person (other than an employee of that person) under whose control and direction an employee works, and (b) where appropriate, the successor of the employer or an associated employer of the employer 'penalisation' means any act or omission by an employer, or by a person acting on behalf of an employer, that affects an employee to his or her detriment with respect to any term or condition of his or her employment, and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, includes— (a) suspension, lay-off or dismissal, (b) the threat of suspension, lay-off or dismissal, (c) demotion or loss of opportunity for promotion, (d) transfer of duties, change of location of place of work, reduction in wages or change in working hours, (e) the imposition or the administering of any discipline, reprimand or other penalty (including a financial penalty), (f) unfair treatment, (g) coercion, intimidation or harassment, (h) discrimination, disadvantage or adverse treatment, (i) injury, damage or loss, and (j) threats of reprisal.' This very important amendment arises out of the discussion we have had on the Bill. I thank the Deputies opposite for that discussion, which was helpful in improving aspects of the Bill. During the debates on Second Stage and Committee Stage, a number of Deputies raised the issue of whistleblower protection. I agreed that there is a need to make provision for the protection of persons who disclose information to the Garda Síochána in relation to relevant offences, as required by section 19, to ensure that such persons will not suffer penalisation in the workplace. Accordingly, I brought forward amendments to provide for protection against dismissal or other penalisation for persons who provide information to the Garda. The provisions are similar to the whistleblower protections provided in the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2010. [756]The provision of whistleblower protection in the Bill does not conflict with the commitments in the agreed programme for Government relating to the introduction of whistleblowing legislation generally. There is a need to provide for specific whistleblower protection in this Bill because it is intended that it will be enacted before the summer recess and I do not wish to delay enactment of the Bill pending the enactment of the more comprehensive whistleblower protection legislation which we hope to see later this year. Amendment No. 4 proposes to insert a new section 20 into the Bill, to provide protection for employees from penalisation for disclosing information relating to relevant offences. Subsection 20(1) prohibits an employer from penalising an employee for making a disclosure to the Garda Síochána in relation to a relevant offence, for giving evidence in relation to that disclosure in any proceedings for a relevant offence or for giving notice of his or her intention to do so. Subsection 20(2) provides that Schedule 2, to be inserted by amendment No. 8, will have effect in relation to an alleged contravention of subsection 20(1). Schedule 2 sets out the procedure for taking complaints before a rights commissioner and the Labour Court. Subsection 20(3) provides that the definition of 'penalisation' in section 20 will not prevent an employer from ensuring that the business concerned is carried on in an efficient manner or from taking any action required for economic, technical or organisational reasons. Subsection 20(4) provides that where an employee wishes to seek redress for having been penalised by dismissal he or she may choose either the remedies available under this Bill or those under the Unfair Dismissals Act or at common law for wrongful dismissal, but not both. Subsection 20(5) sets out certain types of dismissal that are to be included within the meaning of the term 'dismissal'. Subsection 20(6) provides for the definition of certain terms used in sections 20 and 21 and Schedule 2. The term 'disclosure' is defined to clearly link the new whistleblower protection provisions to the text of section 19, which prohibits the withholding of information. Of particular importance is the broad definition of 'penalisation' which includes any act or omission of an employer that affects an employee to his or her detriment with respect to any term or condition of his or her employment. The definition goes on to list specified instances of such acts or omissions. Amendment No. 5 inserts a new section 21, which makes provision for a number of offences. Under subsection 21(1) it would be an offence for an employee to make a disclosure to the Garda Síochána in relation to a relevant offence, knowing the disclosure to be false or being reckless as to whether it is false. Under subsection 21(2) it will be an offence for an employer to contravene subsection 20(1) which prohibits the penalisation of an employee who makes a disclosure as defined in section 20. Subsection 21(3) provides for an offence in relation to false statements made under oath or affirmation by a person appearing as a witness at an appeal to the Labour Court against a finding of a rights commissioner under Schedule 2. Subsection 21(4) provides that where a person has been given notice requiring him or her to attend to give evidence at a Labour Court hearing of an appeal against a finding of a rights commissioner under Schedule 2 or to produce a document relating to the matter, it will be an offence to refuse or wilfully neglect to attend the hearing, to refuse to give evidence or to refuse or wilfully fail to produce the document. Subsections 21(5), 21(6) and 21(7) provide for penalties for persons convicted of offences under the section. Subsection 21(8) is a technical provision that provides for an evidential presumption in respect of a document from the Labour Court relating to a prosecution under subsection 21(4). Amendment No. 8 proposes to insert a new Schedule 2 into the Bill to provide for redress for contravention of the new section 20. Paragraph 1 of the new Schedule 2 sets out the procedure for making a complaint to a rights commissioner that an employer has contravened subsection 20(1). The time limit for making a complaint is, in general, six months from the date [757]of the contravention to which the complaint relates. Where the rights commissioner finds that an employee’s complaint is well founded, the decision may require the employer to take a specified course of action which may include reinstatement or re-engagement in a case where the penalisation has constituted dismissal. The employer may be required to pay compensation of up to two years’ remuneration. Paragraph 2 provides that a party may appeal to the Labour Court from a decision of a rights commissioner under Paragraph 1 and sets out the procedure in relation to such appeals. Provision is made for an appeal from the Labour Court to the High Court on a point of law only and the determination of the High Court on any such point of law is final and conclusive. Paragraph 3 contains supplemental provisions relating to Paragraphs 1 and 2. Paragraph 4 provides for the enforcement of determinations of the Labour Court. If an employer fails to carry out a determination of the Labour Court within 28 days from the date of the communication of the determination to the parties, the employee may apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to carry out the Labour Court determination. The Circuit Court may order the payment of interest on any compensation ordered by the Labour Court. Paragraph 5 provides that an employee to whom compensation is payable under Schedule 2 will be a preferential creditor in the case of the winding up of a company or a bankruptcy. Deputy Jonathan O’Brien may note that for the second time today we are dealing with preferential creditors in legislation. Paragraph 6 provides for the amendment of the Protection of Employees (Employers’ Insolvency) Act 1984 to include compensation payable under Schedule 2 in the insolvency payments scheme. This scheme provides for the payment of certain outstanding entitlements where employment has been terminated because of an employer’s insolvency. Payments are made from the social insurance fund. This is a comprehensive, all-embracing provision designed to fully and properly address the issues that arose during our discussion of the legislation to ensure employees who report to An Garda Síochána instances of white collar crime, as the Bill requires them to do, do so in a manner which also ensures that they cannot be penalised in their employment. If they are penalised, there is a protective mechanism in place and a series of options available to them regarding the road they can travel to obtain the protection to which they are entitled.",14/07/2011,31,1915,1916,2 will be a preferential creditor in the case of the winding up of a company or a bankruptcy Deputy,Jonathan O'Brien,may note that for the second time today we are dealing with preferential creditors in legislation Paragraph 6 provides for,Jonathan O'Brien,4216562_2,,2 will be a preferential creditor in the case of the winding up of a company or a bankruptcy Deputy Jonathan O'Brien may note that for the second time today we are dealing with preferential creditors in legislation Paragraph 6 provides for,2 will be a preferential creditor in the case of the winding up of a company or a bankruptcy Deputy may note that for the second time today we are dealing with preferential creditors in legislation Paragraph 6 provides for,text658,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,-0.162221421,-0.004055536,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.149149149,0.177177177,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4121468,2009,9,137,Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 [Seanad]: Second Stage,02/07/2010,Mr. James Bannon,Fine Gael,Longford -Westmeath,"Against this background, a good and unambiguous definition of a 'breeding bitch', which should be considered for inclusion in the Bill, would be 'a female dog after its first litter'. With regard to the definition of a 'breeding unit', in respect of pigs, such a unit is defined as a place where pigs are bred and reared until they reach 30 kg in weight. A possible suitable adaptation of that definition to the Bill before the House might be that a breeding unit 'means a place where dogs are bred and born'. The legislation would apply only to breeding units with more than the threshold number of breeding bitches or dogs. Selection criteria based on a combination of the suggested definitions I have outlined could remove the unnecessary 'big bite' from the Bill and would focus it instead on the small number of dog breeding establishments that give rise to real problems. This would, in turn, allay the concerns of most ordinary, decent dog lovers and pet owners. As a farmer who has dealt with animals all his life, I am concerned with regard to the long-term implications of the legislation. This week, we have witnessed traditions which developed over centuries being destroyed in a couple of days. In such circumstances, we should mourn the destruction of our unique heritage and wonder about what will take its place. The Minster must not — as always appears to be the case — forget the heritage aspect of his portfolio. The fact that this aspect tends to be forgotten was evidenced by the funding provided in respect of heritage in recent budgets. In light of the legislation the Minister has put before the House this week, it is obvious that the judgment of Solomon would be required to ensure the heritage to which I refer — also our animals — will be protected. In view of the evidence with which we have been presented, I am concerned that the Minister does not come anywhere near to possessing the type of judgment to which I refer. One matter I would have liked the legislation to address — perhaps it might be dealt with in the other legislation the Minister will bring forward — is that relating to retired greyhounds. In light of the adverse publicity on this matter worldwide, it is essential that it should be addressed. While the majority of owners have a finely-honed sense of the duty of care they owe to their animals, it is obvious that abuses are also taking place. Under the general measure relating to cruelty, watertight provision must be made for the protection of these greyhounds. [693] These animals, like all human beings and my colleague on the rearmost benches on the Government side — who was muttering and mumbling earlier and who will have an opportunity to contribute to the debate later — are deserving of care in their retirement. Fine Gael has concerns about the Bill. The party has been very much to the fore in highlighting the issue of puppy farms. Its calls for regulation in this area date back six or seven years. As in respect of all these matters, however, the Minister, much though he would prefer it to be otherwise, does not have his finger on the pulse with regard to rural lifestyles and traditions. This legislation could prove counter-productive, particularly if a large number of regulations are imposed and puppy farms are driven underground as a result. This could give rise to a situation where those who are already running above-board establishments will continue to do so and those whom the legislation should be targeting will, as already stated, go underground. I support the provision relating to the micro-chipping of all dogs in dog breeding establishments. This provides necessary safeguards for dogs and owners and is an example of what is positive about the Bill. However, the Bill goes way beyond the positive in its scope. The additional costs and the duplication of inspection structures to which it will give rise will impact on rural industries beyond that relating to the breeding of greyhounds. Fine Gael proposed amendments in the Seanad that would exclude these areas and direct the focus of the Bill towards puppy farms. However, with his usual lack of flexibility — the hallmark of the dictatorship to which I referred earlier — the Minister refused all of these proposals and has brought an unchanged Bill before the Dáil. As everyone is aware, Fine Gael is not alone in challenging the legislation. Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators have been vocal in criticising what they also perceive as an attack on rural Ireland. Last week, many Fianna Fáil Deputies were extremely hypocritical when the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill was debated.",02/07/2010,30,678,679,structures to which it will give rise will impact on rural industries beyond that relating to the breeding of greyhounds,Fine Gael,proposed amendments in the Seanad that would exclude these areas and direct the focus of the Bill towards puppy farms,Fine Gael,4121468_2,,structures to which it will give rise will impact on rural industries beyond that relating to the breeding of greyhounds Fine Gael proposed amendments in the Seanad that would exclude these areas and direct the focus of the Bill towards puppy farms,structures to which it will give rise will impact on rural industries beyond that relating to the breeding of greyhounds proposed amendments in the Seanad that would exclude these areas and direct the focus of the Bill towards puppy farms,text291,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,0.079056942,0.001976424,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.525525526,0.507507508,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

767021,318,9,152,"Reports from Committees. - Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance) Bill, 1951—Second Stage (Resumed).",15/11/1951,Mr. James M. Dillon,Fine Gael,Monaghan,"I want to register in a most solemn way my protest against the betrayal of people who took the word of the Government of this country. I think the Government has a solemn duty to honour this bargain. They may give notice that they are going to terminate a bargain which they do not approve of, but the liabilities outstanding must be discharged and, in respect of many people in this country, they are not being discharged now, and it is wrong. They have a right to the assurance that the Government of this country will do more than talk in restoring to independent men who take a pride in their independence the right to walk into their bank, when they have to, to get the accommodation they require for the legitimate prosecution of their business without taking off their hat or being beholden to any moneyed power in the world. It is as well that we should face it. I am not a radical in these matters. I would preserve the sterling link. I value highly our sterling assets. I know the arguments for and I know the arguments against, but I believe that the existing method of administering bank credits in this [956] country has no logical foundation—but it works. Now that is the point: I think it works. It is very hard to get a system that works pragmatically. For that reason I want the system that we know does work to go on working. But it is right to say now that should it ever accept to itself the illusion that there is any master in this country but the legitimate Government, ours are not a people who will tolerate that illusion long. I have said time and again to many conservatives who sought to argue the right-hand view with me: 'Watch your step, because in your solicitude to press down on our people a degree of so-called orthodoxy which our people will not accept you may precipitate an upheaval that will sweep away far more than you or I would like to see go, with no guarantee whatever that anything will be put in its place that will work half so well.' I urge the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to bestir themselves now and to see that these institutions work well and chop no logic with us. We have not come to chop logic about economics. We have no apology to make to money changers for being politicians. We became that of our own free will and we are proud to be that in the public life of Ireland. With that authority about us, we know our people better than money changers whether they be moneylenders, pawnbrokers or bankers. They all come to the same thing. They all live by usury, greater or less. That is where Deputy Hickey and I come dangerously close to agreeing with one another. I may contaminate him politically, but I am always afraid he will drive me mad. It ought to be treated quite apart from the rules of orthodoxy. They had better make the system work and they had better make it work, because we want it, and it is we who count. The only justification there is for their existence is the quality of the service they give our people. If it ever seems to us that they have forgotten their obligation to serve and have, for a moment, succumbed to the illusion that they have a right to rule, and attempt to use their power to that end, we will sweep them out of existence [957] without a moment's hesitation and face the future: whatever it may be, it could not be worse than that.

2009971,32,9,33,"Housing Finance Agency Bill, 1981: Second Stage (Resumed).",16/12/1981,Mr. Peter Barry,Fine Gael,Cork City South-East,"We have plenty of time. Deputy Leyden spoke last week about spouses' incomes being considered for loans and wanted to know when it was introduced. I wish to quote from a letter which was issued by the Department of the Environment to Dublin County Council on 6 March 1981: In reply to your query about the determination of eligibility on income grounds I am to confirm that income from all sources must be taken into account and in this context there does not appear to be any justification for disregarding the income of a spouse whose employment is of a permanent nature. In all cases the Council should only advance loans to applicants whose circumstances are such that they are unable to obtain loans from a commercial agency. That was sent out by Mr. Raphael P. Burke, T. D., the then Minister for the Environment. That is the second time I have had to place that on record. Deputy Burke made the point that we should use existing institutions rather than set up a new agency. The primary purpose of the Bill is to raise additional finance for household mortgages to meet a growing housing requirement. The inflow of funds to building societies is still less than satisfactory, despite the increase in investment rates from 1 October 1981. Because of the acute shortage of Exchequer funds the Government are unable to increase the SDA loan and income limits. The new agency will tap funds from pension funds and life offices. That is the source of the funds. When the previous Government introduced the housing package last April, they estimated they would need at least £9 million extra this year for SDA loans. They refused to make any provision for this expenditure before the change of Government last June. Deputy Connolly said they had intended to do it by means of a Supplementary Estimate later in the [2331] year but as these are not voted funds, a Supplementary Estimate would have been unnecessary. They had April, May and June to provide these funds. As I said a number of times, but it does not seem to have got home to the Deputies over there, we had to provide an extra £30 million on 1 July this year because the amount of money provided by Fianna Fáil for local authority housing in the 1981 Estimates was less than had been spent in 1980. That is why people building houses in Deputy Moore's constituency were not laid off — if there had not been a change of Government they would have been laid off in their thousands throughout Dublin. Deputy Burke expressed fear that the existence of the agency would have the effect of slowing the flow of funds into the building societies. I do not think there is any substance in that because the agency is designed to attract institutional funds whereas building societies rely mainly on savings. When I opened the EBS offices in Westmoreland Street the other night I assured the building societies that the setting up of the agency would not militate against their operations. On the contrary, I see the agency as being able to assist in stabilising the total funds available for housing mortgages. The flow of funds from the agency could be increased when there is a drop in money available to the societies, thereby relieving the demand on the societies for loans during those periods. Deputy Burke said the amount of money outstanding would be increased steadily under the new system. If the Deputies had paid attention to my speech earlier they would have got my point, but in case there might be any misunderstanding, it must be emphasised that the amount of the principal outstanding under the proposed system would normally decline in real terms when inflation is taken into account. Deputy Burke emphasised that the building industry requires finance and not a new agency. Broadly, that is probably true but what we are doing is providing the means of getting finance to the industry which was not available heretofore. [2332] People who want to provide their own houses have three or four choices in the way they will pay for their houses. They can get their loans through banks or insurance companies, which is an expensive way. They can get the money through the building societies whose loans are expensive: we heard earlier today that repayments to building societies absorb between 40 per cent and 45 per cent of a person's income in the first years. People can get finance through the SDA system which is a very attractive way because the interest rate is subsidised. Of course people can pay cash. Only the very wealthy can do that, but it is the cheapest way for a person to provide himself with a house. It means, of course, that there is nobody in the housing market who can acquire a house as cheaply as the rich man. He does not have to get a mortgage or a bank overdraft or a building loan. He does not even have to pay the cheapest rate of interest, which is on the SDA loan.",16/12/1981,22,384,385,we had to provide an extra 30 million on 1 July this year because the amount of money provided by,Fianna Fáil,for local authority housing in the 1981 Estimates was less than had been spent in 1980 That is why people,Fianna Fáil,2009971_3,,we had to provide an extra 30 million on 1 July this year because the amount of money provided by Fianna Fáil for local authority housing in the 1981 Estimates was less than had been spent in 1980 That is why people,we had to provide an extra 30 million on 1 July this year because the amount of money provided by for local authority housing in the 1981 Estimates was less than had been spent in 1980 That is why people,text378,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.341666667,0.008541667,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.904904905,0.853853854,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2941835,515,9,142,"Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1997 [ Seanad ]: Second Stage.",17/12/1997,Mr. Jim Higgins,Fine Gael,Mayo East,"(Mayo): I welcome the Bill in that, by increasing the number of High Court judges, it should lead to speedier justice. Emphasis on speedier justice was very much to the fore of the agenda of the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, within whose tenure in office investment in the courts increased from £23. 8 million in 1994 to £30. 5 million in 1997. The working group on the Courts Commission laid the basis for the Courts Service Bill, passed by the Seanad, which will be discussed in this House shortly and was based on the detail of four major reports. In addition, the number of judges permitted by legislation was increased from 86 to 110 in other words, 24 extra judges were appointed to our courts in just over two years compared with an additional ten in the preceding ten years. A second Supreme Court was established so that two cases could be heard simultaneously in that court. Furthermore, additional court sittings were arranged to reduce the backlog. The net result is that the period for obtaining a court date has been reduced from two years to within six weeks of lodgment. In the Dublin Circuit Court the period for obtaining a court date in family law cases has been reduced from 16 months to four months and delays in the hearing of criminal cases have been virtually eliminated. In the Dublin High Court delays in hearing personal injury actions have been reduced from 35 to 20 months. However, there are certain accepted norms and procedures which, if abolished, would certainly speed up the administration of justice in our courts and might even dispense with the need for the extra judicial appointments proposed in this Bill. I visited the Four Courts last week. Not being a lawyer I was absolutely fascinated to see Court 12, for example, packed with barristers and a High Court judge presiding over the setting of the timetable and calendar for court hearings, part of [720] what is known as listings. Every Monday morning there are two common law listings with High Court judges tied up on basic administrative work which could just as efficiently be carried out by a specially trained civil servant or clerk. Alternatively it could be easily filtered by a registrar as is the case in Britain where there is a listing system twice a month when defence lawyers, almost guru-like in style, receive a rap on the knuckles for failure to file in time. There is also a warning list and a call-over list in relation to personal injuries. That is a gross waste of time and valuable judicial experience and personnel. The United Kingdom system deals efficiently with the rather mundane work involved in listings and releases judges to their primary function of dispensing justice. That problem could be remedied in this country in 70 per cent of cases, perhaps in all cases except those where legal issues are to be determined. We must revisit procedures and dispose of traditional but time wasting practices which have become an unnecessary and ingrained part of the system. I welcome the Bill and the appointment of two extra judges because of the assigning of judges to tribunal duties. Tribunals, by and large, have been invaluable in terms of sifting through some of the more unseemly aspects of political practice and behaviour over recent years. It is crucial for the restoration of confidence in the body politic that the tribunals currently afoot can fully discharge their functions, establish full facts and send out a clear signal that shadiness and shoddiness have no place in Irish political life. As I said in the House last week, if either tribunal fails to fulfil its remit, I have no doubt that more damage than good will accrue. I welcome in particular the decision to limit the appointments of Chief Justice and the Presidents of the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court to seven years. Indeed, that practice might well be replicated in other walks of life. I proposed a similar idea, when I was education spokesman for my party a number of years ago, for school principalships from the point of view of enhancing promotional prospects and incentives in the teaching profession as well as acknowledging the burn out factor which is a feature of modern schools. I did not envisage, however, that they would settle back to less onerous positions with their emoluments intact, as happens in this case. I do not understand the motivation of the people who drafted section 35 of the Constitution but it should be adequate for judges' pension entitlements to be enhanced by the percentage of the additional salary for the seven year period in question they are presiding over the court without the guarantee of the full higher rate, even though he or she no longer continues to do the management job. That seems to be a bad principle and a wrong practice which is impossible to explain. I do not understand the reason for it. Perhaps the Minister would indicate what is behind this section of the Constitution which [721] determines that even though a person is no longer doing the job they continue to draw the pay. I agree with the flexibility the Bill introduces in terms of accommodating short-term adjustment of the number of judges in the various courts depending on whatever procedural or promotional positions are put in place. There is a strong case for examining the possible unification of the legal profession, in particular the eligibility of solicitors to become judges of the Supreme Court. Since solicitors can appear and have the right of audience in the Supreme Court they should at least be eligible to be judges of that court. People should be assessed on their qualifications and competence to do the job and, without wishing to be judgmental of judges, it is generally agreed that solicitor-judges are recognised as good judges. The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995, allowed, for the first time, solicitors to be appointed to either the Supreme Court or the High Court. As a result, a solicitor became eligible to become a judge of the Circuit Court. Any solicitor who has been a judge of the Circuit Court for four years or more becomes eligible for appointment to the High Court and from that to the Supreme Court. I hope the Minister will accept my amendment which will introduce full uniformity in judicial appointments. In view of the fact that the Minister is in the process of introducing two Bills to the Oireachtas, the Courts (No. 2) Bill and the Courts Service Bill, for which I am sure he will be willing to claim and accept the credit, I hope he will realise that there is a consequent obligation and responsibility to answer questions. The refusal of the Minister to make any attempt to explain to the Dáil the systems failure in relation to the arrest and release, re-arrest and re-release, of persons connected with the Tallaght cannabis haul was not good enough. The Minister initially refused to divulge any of the relevant details to which this House and the general public are entitled. He eventually came into the House the following week and gave the facts, which he had not done the previous week, as they transpired in the intervening period. It then transpired that the Minister imparted the wrong information in relation to the number of judges in the Dublin Metropolitan Area. The Minister had to come into the House on Tuesday, 2 December and again tell the House that a third judge had been appointed for the purpose of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act. I ask the Minister if he is absolutely satisfied that no other judge who had not been nominated for the purpose of this Act acted in relation to the extension of detention warrants. I agree with the thrust of the Bill and I join with the Minister in commending it to the House. I have tabled an amendment which has substantial merit and substance and I hope he will see his way to accept it because it is the right direction in which to go. [722]Dr. Upton: I welcome the Bill, the main provisions of which seem to be necessary, relevant and sensible in the context of the increasing demands now being placed on the Judiciary. The main provision of the Bill is to increase the total number of judges in the High Court to 24 which is reasonable in the context of the increasing workload in the courts and the involvement of judges in tribunals, commissions and so on. The amount of work carried out by judges in areas outside the courts over the past number of years has been exceptional by any standards. There is no doubt that tribunals and commissions consume an enormous amount of judicial time. While tribunals have a function and are necessary, I hope we are coming towards the end of the current spate of tribunals. The public will become exhausted with them and their cost. It is important that the Bill should lighten the workload and the pressure on judges because it is essential that they have an opportunity to reflect at some length, particularly in certain cases, before they make judgments. Such decisions should be arrived at in a calm manner. Judges should not feel under pressure to reach decisions as a result of their workload. It is more important that the decisions arrived at are given a little more consideration than is normally the case. The placing of a limit of seven years on non-renewable appointments for the positions of Chief Justice and Presidents of the High Court, the Supreme Court and the District Court is in accordance with modern thinking on the appointment of key decision makers throughout the public service and in business. In the wider public service, county managers and people of similar status are normally appointed on a five year contract. Many of those in business have similar contracts including the heads of institutions such as universities. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that while this should be the normal procedure, there may be exceptional circumstances in which it might be necessary to deviate from that general principle. As a general rule, however, it is desirable and it will greatly enhance the functioning of the courts. I am pleased the Minister has decided this provision will only apply to appointments made after the Bill has been enacted. That is a wise decision because an attempt to apply the new measures to existing appointees may give rise to some discord as well as exposing the State to the risk of legal challenges which, in the event of their being successful, would be very undesirable. It is sensible that retiring presidents of the various courts should be allowed serve in the relevant court after their presidential appointment has expired. I have no doubt those people will have accumulated a good deal of wisdom during their period of appointment and that some of that wisdom will be transferred and transmitted in the general environment in which judges find themselves. That is desirable rather than much of the wisdom and experience they would have accumulated being lost when they retire. It is worthwhile that [723] ex-presidents of the various courts should be still practising, as it were, in the courts so that those who may want to seek their advice would be able to obtain it. I am fascinated the Minister included a section in the Bill which lays down the pecking order of the various judges after they have retired. I would have thought such a matter would be determined by custom and practice and the tradition associated with law rather than it being necessary to write that into the Bill. It might be a precaution to avoid wigs on the green in the event of someone overstepping the mark. In the world of high decorum I associate with the law I would have thought it might not have been necessary for the Minister to include that provision in the Bill, but perhaps we should not underestimate the capacity for contention and discord in some circumstances. I understand the catalyst for the introduction of this Bill was the retirement of Mr. Justice Declan Costello from his position as President of the High Court. During the debate in the Seanad a number of tributes were paid to him for the manner in which he carried out his duties as a judge and carried on his career as a lawyer and a politician, which included the role of being a TD and Attorney General. I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to him in the debate in the Seanad. He seemed to be an excellent judge, but I do not speak from a position of having any great insights into the law as I am not a lawyer. His career as a politician was worthwhile. He filled the role of a TD and the position of Attorney General with a good deal of distinction. His role as a political thinker and writer had a significant influence on Irish politics generally. He is credited with having written 'Just Society', a forward looking and progressive document at the time it was published. The ideas contained in it are in sharp contrast to some of the other cautious ones that were prevalent at that time. I wish Mr. Justice Costello every happiness and fulfilment in retirement after his very distinguished career on a number of different fronts. I am also fascinated by Deputy Higgins's amendment which he mentioned during his Second Stage contribution. It deals with the idea that solicitors can go all the way to the top. That is not a matter on which I have a well grounded view. I would not like to get involved in any exchanges of discord about it, suffice to say I have met a number of barristers who are quite disturbed — a stronger word might be more appropriate — at the prospect of solicitors going all the way to the top. However, that is a matter I am happy to leave to the rarefied atmosphere of the higher end of the legal profession, but I am sure the Minister, who is also a solicitor, has a view on that which he may be too cautious to share with us or is not prepared to take the risk that would be attached to expressing it.",17/12/1997,28,42,43,Emphasis on speedier justice was very much to the fore of the agenda of the former Minister for Justice Deputy,Nora Owen,within whose tenure in office investment in the courts increased from 23 8 million in 1994 to 30 5 million,Nora Owen,2941835_2,,Emphasis on speedier justice was very much to the fore of the agenda of the former Minister for Justice Deputy Nora Owen within whose tenure in office investment in the courts increased from 23 8 million in 1994 to 30 5 million,Emphasis on speedier justice was very much to the fore of the agenda of the former Minister for Justice Deputy within whose tenure in office investment in the courts increased from 23 8 million in 1994 to 30 5 million,text406,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.557801808,0.013945045,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.976976977,0.937937938,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1716341,410,9,21,"Wealth Tax Bill, 1975: Committee Stage (Resumed).",16/07/1975,Mr. Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick,Fine Gael,Cavan,"(Cavan): When we discussed section 4 Deputy Colley argued quite strongly that there should be a separate threshold in respect of a husband and a wife and that threshold should be £70,000 in each case. I pointed out then that the effect of that would be to reduce the married allowance or married threshold provided in the Bill. Deputy Colley's argument then was that the husband and wife should each retain a single threshold of £70,000. I pointed out that the effect of that would be a loss of threshold in many cases. In most Irish situations one or other of the spouses has the wealth and the other may have little or none. It is usually the husband who has the wealth because he inherits the family farm or the family business. I also pointed out on that occasion— I will not go over all the ground again —that to do what Deputy Colley was suggesting then would bring economic pressure to bear on the husband to transfer a portion of his wealth to his wife, a portion of his farm, a portion of his business, in order to avail of the threshold, and that might lead to difficult situations and have consequences which were not thought of. The threshold provided for a married couple is £100,000. Deputy Colley has drawn attention to the fact that, in the Bill in various places, we refer to the individual whose wife is living with him and he goes on to make the [1977] political point that, in some way or another, that is a reflection on the wife and regards her as an appendage of the husband. There is no such reflection intended good, bad, or indifferent. The actual fact is that we have to have an accountable person and in a family situation where there is a man and a wife and minor children, the accountable person is the husband and reference, therefore, is made to the wife. In this amendment Deputy Colley, as he is perfectly entitled to do, makes a different case from that which he made on section 4 and says now that there should be two individual thresholds of £70,000 each but that there should be a joint threshold of £140,000. I cannot accept that because I do not think it is necessary. What I am doing in the Bill is striking a happy medium between Deputy Colley's suggestion on section 4 of providing an effective threshold of £70,000 for the husband, unless he divested himself of some of his wealth in order to qualify for a double one, and the joint one here of a £140,000. I am striking a happy medium and I am providing a married threshold of £100,000 which I think is reasonable. There are reasons why a double threshold is not necessary. First of all, I repeat that two people living together —and I am not suggesting that they can live cheaper than one——",16/07/1975,20,7,8,Cavan When we discussed section 4,Deputy Colley,argued quite strongly that there should be a separate threshold in respect of a husband and a wife and that,Deputy Colley,1716341_1,,Cavan When we discussed section 4 Deputy Colley argued quite strongly that there should be a separate threshold in respect of a husband and a wife and that,Cavan When we discussed section 4 argued quite strongly that there should be a separate threshold in respect of a husband and a wife and that,text713,1,1,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,0.316,0.012153846,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.881881882,0.914914915,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Listening to her one would think that the Custom House was the fountainhead of all wisdom in the drafting of legislation, that they could, with equanimity and a lily white record in terms of drafting excellence, nit-pick at the provisions of other Bills. I should not, but cannot resist, the temptation to engage in the bad grace of referring to the Building Control Bill which has been virtually rewritten twice by the same technical people who help the Ministers of the day in relation to this matter. We are not discussing the technical provisions of this Bill. The Minister of State has done hereself, her Government and the legislative process of this House a great disservice by the note she struck in her concluding remarks. In fairness to Deputy Shatter — whose technical expertise in this matter is certainly above [1124] the norm obtaining in this House — he was the first to invite the House to offer amendments and declared a willingness on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, who sponsored this Bill, to be open to wide ranging amendments on Committee Stage without preconditions. Therefore, we should confine ourselves exclusively on Second Stage to the provisions of this Bill to establish an Environment Protection Agency. Without wishing to nit-pick, I suggest that the title should be amended to read 'Environment Management Agency Bill, 1989' rather than the 'Environment Protection Agency Bill, 1989', because part of the task ahead of us is to learn how to manage our environment. However, I would not for a moment suggest that that constituted sufficient grounds for our not accepting this Bill at this stage. I commend the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Shatter on the service they have done this House and the Government — if only they had the wit to recognise it — in having provided them with an opportunity to jump the clogged queue to the parliamentary draftsman's office in providing the Minister of State and her senior Minister access on the floor of the House to a Bill which, broadly speaking, is in line with most of the provisions Government policy enunciates in terms of the type of legislation they would like to see enacted. Bearing in mind our forthcoming EC Presidency — which we have been told from Strasbourg will be a green one — I would suggest that some credibility would be afforded that Presidency had we a Bill on the establishment of an environmental protection agency at least in course of passage through this House. The Minister was unable to give the House a clear indication that a Bill would be circulated when we return after Christmas. I share Deputy Shatter's pessimism in regard to the delivery mechanisms of Government to produce the type of legislation about which we are speaking within the term of our so-called EC Presidency. The Labour Party will be supporting this Bill on Second Stage. Furthermore, because, on Second Stage, we do not [1125] believe it is necessarily divisive, we would seriously ask the Government to reconsider their position. After all, it is the season of goodwill, the Berlin Wall is tumbling, right across Europe all sorts of people are changing their minds, and perhaps the conventional legislative cuture that pervades all Government Departments might be altered in this instance so that the Government and Minister of State — with direct responsibility for such an agency — would examine the possibility of accepting this Bill in principle on Second Stage without preconditions or being hostages to fortune. The spirit of Deputy Shatter's remarks are on the record. Once accepted on Second Stage the Bill would be open to amendments from all sides with the majority carrying those amendments through. I do not believe there will be significant disagreement about the main objectives of such an agency. By way of anecdote I might introduce some substance to the suggestions I have just offered the Minister of State. I suggest that she examine the Private Members' Homeless Persons' Bill introduced by Senator Brendan Ryan, a Bill full of defects which was placed on my desk when I held the position now held by the Minister of State. I recommended precisely the course of action I am now recommending to her, but I was overruled. I regret that I was overruled but I was not at the Cabinet table to argue my point. The prevailing political, administrative, bureaucratic, political culture of the Department of the Environment — not peculiar to that Department, it pervades all Government Departments — is that one does not give the Opposition any kind of concession whatsoever. We could have accepted that Homeless Persons' Bill proposed by Senator Brandan Ryan in 1983-84 without having compromised ourselves in any way. We could have tabled the type of amendments subsequently tabled after an awful lot of unnecessary hassle. We are this evening talking about an attitude to a Bill on Second Reading. I will not go into the merits or demerits of [1126] its contents which I broadly support. I want to talk to the Minister of State — who is renowned for her courage and spirited advocacy of political decisions in which she believes — and tell her that the Department of the Environment is not renowned for speedy delivery on a number of fronts in relation to certain kinds of legislation. That Department are not masters of their destiny in relation to responses from other Government Departments, including the parliamentary draftsman and the Office of the Attorney General. Their track record, not alone in relation to the Building Control Bill in terms of sheer quality of drafting which should render them very hesitant to criticise anybody else's drafting of legislation — can be compared only with the total political failure of that Department to circulate the Bill for the establishment of a national roads authority. I say this despite the fact that it was repeatedly enunciated as being a matter of priority as far as the Government were concerned. I would suggest to the Minister of State that, over the next three to four weeks, time be taken to reflect on the opportunity the House is offering the Government in relation to this Bill. It would be a mistake to simply oppose it, as we have done on all sides so many times in the past. Indeed I have been party to majority votes in this House which blindly followed the same kind of legislative logic, which is simply that if the other side was proposing something, we had to oppose it. There is no fundamental or principle opposition to this Bill. In essence we are all agreed on the need for the establishment of such an agency. Had we been doing our job properly Second Stage should have concluded by now. I do not want to run away with myself but I was going to say we should by now have adjourned to a select committee of the House, away from the full Press or public gallery, and gone into the business of arguing its various sections, examining the pros and cons of what type of agency, what type of authority, we want, what should be their terms of reference and so on. There is no principled argument on [1127] Second Stage that basically divides us. Yet what is going to happen? The prevailing political culture that has dominated so many administrations in this country will be: Do not give in you have to hold the line we will bring in our own Bill sometime in the new year, maybe before St. Patrick's Day but certainly not later than Easter. The Irish green Presidency will look precisely that — very green and very bereft — because the Government will not have delivered. The Minister should seriously seek advice from her senior colleagues in the Coalition Government of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil and look at the tactics of how the agency are to be established by way of legislation between now and June. That is the first point I want to make and I want to underline it. I am not trying to make some cheap debating point. I appreciate the Minister's difficulties and I understand the kind of advice she will be getting from all quarters but at the end of the day the Minister of State has exclusive political responsibility for the establishment of this agency. She is the person who will be identified as the person who did or did not deliver on this measure. The Minister is not necessarily being helped, objectively speaking, by the fact that she has to climb over the rubble of destruction that has been left behind by the current incumbent Minister for the Environment whose executioner hands at the throat of An Foras Forbartha are still covered with the blood of that inane decision. I am speaking metaphorically in response to the kind of rhetorical style to which Deputy Flynn frequently has recourse. I thought I would match measure. The Minister, in the course of her speech, talked about hiring specialist consultant staff. We used to have them once upon a time. They used to be on the public payroll but they have been paid to leave. Some of them are no longer in the country. Some of them are so disgusted at the way in which they learned, through the public media, of the termination of their employment that they will never [1128] again trust a public authority as a prospective employer. We are a small nation with a small bank of skills. Holding on to those skills and developing them and keeping professional people in the public sector at levels of remuneration which in some cases are less than they could earn in the private sector — acting for the poacher rather than for the gamekeeper — has always been a difficult task of management. That task has now been made immensely more difficult because of the rubble of destruction to which I referred earlier. Yet the person who is responsible for that destruction is not in the House tonight and I presume will not participate in this debate. At some stage the senior Minister will take this Bill through the Cabinet. I understand that the heads of the alternative Bill have not yet been circulated to the Cabinet but the Minister who will argue his corner at the Cabinet table should at least respond to the debate or participate in it on Second Stage. Untold damage has been done to the core skills of environmental research and monitoring to which the Minister's speech refers and to which Deputy Shatter's speech refers also. Because of the ludicrous way in which An Foras Forbartha had their terms of engagement terminated we have messed up the careers and the professional perception of a number of people who have worked in this area. As a consequence of that bungling and I agree entirely with what Deputy Shatter has said, public confidence in the objectivity of the State's system at national and local level to dispassionately evaluate development proposals, the environmental impact of which may be damaging or dangerous has been shattered. We have damaged that rare and precious ingredient of public confidence which over the years was built up on foot of trust in An Foras Forbartha. The task the Government of the day have now in relation to the establishment of a new agency has been made all the more difficult as a consequence of the actions that this coalition Government, and to a far greater extent their predecessor, the [1129] minority Fianna Fáil Government, have undertaken. Let me give a specific example. The Leader of the party to which Deputy Harney, the Minister of State present in the House tonight, belongs, certainly undermined public confidence in the objectivity of the planning process when he gave the impression to the ordinary public in the greater Cork region that planning permission had been prematurely granted to a Swiss chemical plant. This, after the fiasco of the Merrell Dow incident, undermined the confidence that a significant section of the public have in this process. It was the compounding of an error on top of a series of errors which made the establishment of this agency absolutely urgent. The Minister's speech is a good speech. A competent official was told to go off and do a demolition job on Deputy Shatter's Bill and it is not a bad demolition job. Some points have been picked out which, on reflection, Deputy Shatter might consider again on Committee Stage. If the demolition job was coming from a Government who at all times introduced legislation that was so perfect that they would not even bother introducing any Minister's amendments, we would accept that the demolition job had some intellectual clout and credibility for which we would have some respect but that is not the case. The reality is that Department sponsoring legislation through their Ministers frequently have second thoughts on Committee Stage and frequently bring in ministerial amendments, some simply to correct the grammar, some simply to remove internal linguistic contradictions and provide clarifications of meaning which might otherwise produce ambiguity and others indicating that they are not happy with what they wanted to do originally and had found a better way of doing it. There is no shame attached to that process. There is no declaration of intellectual feebleness in indicating that you had second thoughts and you wanted to make something a little better by way of amendment. Why is such a process [1130] acceptable from a Government point of view and totally unacceptable from an Opposition point of view? The sort of criticisms contained towards the end of the Minister's speech in relation to some of the points raised are nit picking in their most extreme and frankly are beneath the standard of political participation that the Minister has set for herself in the past. I want to refer to the perception of the independence of the authority. In this respect there is a fundamental difference between what the Fine Gael Bill proposes on the one hand and what the Government's hastily convened press conference, held in the middle of the smog to provide cover of a different kind, tried to indicate last week. I would like Government spokespersons or other Deputies to clarify this during the course of the Second Stage debate. I have the distinct impression that the agency as proposed by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition will be an agency as subservient to ministerial dictat as were An Foras Forbartha and as is the environmental research unit. This needs to be clarified if this is the kind of agency the Government have in mind — it may very well be the kind of agency the Department of Finance are insisting is the only one they will give clearance to — it will not meet the requirements the rest of us in this House seek and will do untold damage to the Government's bid for the establishment and location on this island of the proposed European environmental protection agency, which I think we all support. It would be an absolute disaster if the meanness of spirit which has frequently characterised some of the spirits in Merrion Street was to prevail and come through in the formulation of this legislation so such an extent that the opportunity to achieve the objectives of a green island and a green Irish presidency would be thwarted by such a measure.

4163175,1028,9,90,Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill 2010: Committee and Remaining Stages,10/12/2010,Mr. Alan Shatter,Fine Gael,Dublin South,"Deputy Gogarty amply fulfils the role of national comedian. The tragedy is that it is the judgment of persons like Deputy Gogarty that has resulted in the catastrophic economic collapse of the State. I make a recommendation to Deputy Gogarty. It is that after the election has taken its course and the people have made the judgment that I expect them to make on him and his party, and as I have no wish to see him unemployed, Cirque du Soleil, a successful organisation that provides a great deal of entertainment, no doubt could make use of his talents. I would suggest to him that he send his CV to that company in advance of the election being called for fear that an important opportunity that might be available to him might be taken up by someone else. I want to deal with one issue of relevance to this amendment and to where we are heading. The proposed amendment seeks to protect current workers in receipt of the minimum wage. This legislation makes provision not only for changing the minimum wage, but for various reductions also in public sector wages across the board. Of course, it excludes the variety of State agencies that are detailed in the Schedule. That is something else that needs to be addressed but, I appreciate, if I went into that at this moment, I would be going outside the amendment with which we are dealing. However, I want to make a contrast with regard to those on the minimum wage, the Government’s opposition to this amendment, including the way in which Deputy Gogarty will vote, and another matter. I should say to Deputy Gogarty, in case I forget to do so, that if he is really in favour of this and if his conscience is such that he wants to support it, there are some of us who are Members of this House who on occasions have had the courage to vote with our conscience. I well recall in the early 1990s in this House, at a time when it was a matter of some controversy, supporting legislation to ban live hare coursing in circumstances in which my party was not voting along those lines.

853759,652,8,30,Committee on Finance. - Vote 49—Gaeltacht Services (Resumed).,22/10/1953,Mr. Jack Lynch,Fianna Fáil,Cork Borough,"Ba mhór an trua é, dar liom, már labhair oiread agus aon Teachta amháin Gaeilge ar an dtaobh eile den Tigh imeasc an cháineadh sheirbh go léir a dheineadar. Tá's agam gurbh fhéidir le cuid de na Teachtaí Ghaeilge labhairt go líofa ach dobé a ngnó féin é labhairt nó gan labhairt i nGaeilge. I think, a Cheann Comhairle, that, having regard to the fact that most of the debate and most of the attacks on the Estimate for Gaeltacht Services, and particularly the attack on the Estimate of the office of Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng, were conducted in English, I will reply to it in English to-day. Many of the Deputies from the other side went to particular pains in their all-out attack on this office to exonerate me personally from any lash of their tongues. I want to assure them that, much as I appreciate their concern for me personally, I have no desire to shield behind the fact that I am the occupant of the public office. I do not intend in any way to [355] dissociate my personality—and I use the word personality in its physical and mental senses—from the public office which I hold. After two years of it, I am used to attacks both front and rear and even broadside sniping. Therefore, I want to assure them that I am a bit more thick skinned now than I was when I took up office a little over two years ago. There is one point, however, in the case made by the other side particularly against Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng and that is that there is much inconsistency not particularly in the manner in which it was presented yesterday but in the manner in which it was presented yesterday compared with last year. Much of the debate was conducted both this year and last year by the same Deputies. Last year, it was attacked because it was felt that Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng was set up largely as a publicity medium for the Government and that it was set up with ballyhoo and, as Deputy McQuillan said, with a flourish of trumpets. For my own part and on behalf of the Taoiseach who was primarily responsible for setting up this office I want to say that the contrary was the case. I am sure that the Deputies who met me when I visited their areas will admit that I went to considerable trouble to impress on the people whose grievances I heard, and whose suggestions I heard, and later examined, that I had no false ideas that my office, no matter how powerful it might be ultimately, was going to change the face of the West of Ireland overnight, or even in a period of two years. I should like to impress on Deputies here generally, though I am sure I do not have to impress it on most of the Deputies who spoke in this debate, many of whom are natives of the West of Ireland, that the problems in the West of Ireland are largely historical and that many of them are centuries old. For that reason, there is no way out for me to say that these problems will take centuries to solve. There is no reason why they should but, on the other hand, I never claimed that [356] they were going to be completely solved in the short period of two years. The tone of the debate yesterday would indicate to me that Deputies, on the other side, expected that by now emigration should have ceased in the West of Ireland, and that all the amenities available in big towns and cities should be available in the West of Ireland, with the result that industries should be thriving and bright lights shining along the western coast. The line of attack, generally, seemed to be based on the alleged ineffectiveness of Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng. I should like to explain to Deputies, for the third time, the purpose of this office. It was set up as a co-ordinating machine, to co-ordinate the activities of the different Departments of State in so far as their activities affect the West of Ireland, the Gaeltacht, the Breac-Ghaeltacht and the congested districts generally. Everybody knows of the existence, at one time, of the Congested Districts Board. They know the amount of valuable work it did in many spheres. They know also that, on the setting up of this State 30 years ago, the Congested Districts Board disappeared, and that its various activities were absorbed in the different Departments of State which were set up at that time. According as the work of administration of these Departments increased, it was not unnatural to expect that the same attention might not be given to the particular requirements of the congested district within these different Departments. It was mainly with that end in view that the necessary attention should be given to the particular requirements of the congested districts that this office was set up. The figure in the Estimate, something exceeding £7,000, relates purely to salaries. Therefore I cannot understand what some Deputies were referring to when they mentioned this huge sum of money that was at my disposal and that was not being spent to any degree in the West of Ireland. I think it would be superfluous and only adding to complexity, at this stage at any rate, if I were given moneys to expend which up to the present are [357] being expended by the various Departments. Each of the Departments, whether it be Lands, Agriculture, Forestry (which is a branch of the Department of Lands) has over the years built up technical staffs and systems of administration, and to superimpose another body of administrators and technicians on the existing ones would, I think, make for confusion. On the other hand there is a necessity for co-ordination. I think I need only mention one particular aspect of work which is peculiar more to the West of Ireland than to any other part of the country to illustrate the necessity for co-ordination. There are all along the coast small piers, slipways and small harbours, the responsibility for the construction and maintenance of which is reposed in different Departments, whether they be county councils, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and with a certain amount of responsibility in the case of the Department of Agriculture. When the need arises for having certain works and repairs done in these places, it is obvious that some co-ordinating machine should be there. I think that a scheme, working through the aegis of the inter-departmental committee attached to my office, with the co-operation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, and as approved ultimately by the Government, will make for more expeditious treatment of complaints with regard to the maintenance and repair of these minor marine works throughout the West of Ireland. As a result of the increase in the engineering staff that is being recruited, and, with the speeding up of these necessary works—the clearing away of bottle-necks and obstacles—there is evidence of considerably increased activity in minor marine works along the whole coast-line. I believe that this activity will increase still more in the future. Deputy Blowick led the line of attack when he opened the debate from the other side of the House yesterday. I should like to remind the Deputy that there is hardly a big [358] business organisation in any part of the world to-day—and we hear a lot about business methods and management and their importance at the present time—that has not got some co-ordinating machine attached to it. Surely, when dealing with the problems that are peculiar to the West of Ireland, and which are so complex, and the responsibility for which reposes in so many different Departments and branches of Departments of State, some co-ordinating machine is at least as necessary as we are told it is in the case of any big business organisation. We can differ about the type of machine to be set up, but I do not think it can be denied that co-ordination is necessary. In saying that, I am not attempting to try to take any credit away from the Departments which have been doing this work over a number of years. Last year, Deputy Blowick complained that I had not given a sufficient indication as to how this work of co-ordination had been carried out. Yesterday, in my opening statement, I gave, I think, a fairly full indication as to how this work of co-ordination is being done. It was not complete by any means, because it could never be complete, since there are so many different aspects of work involved. But then Deputy Blowick was trying to have it both ways, and sought to establish that I was trying to claim credit for work that was being done by a number of other Departments. I can assure Deputy Blowick and the House that that is very far from the truth. If my job is to ensure the economic and cultural betterment of the West of Ireland, it matters little to me what agency or what Department of State carries it out if the job is done. Deputy Blowick then proceeded to act like Little Jack Horner, telling us what a good boy he was and of the impetus he gave to the work of the Department of Lands during his three years of office. It is a fact—and I am sure Deputy Blowick will admit it—that in the past two years more work, particularly with regard to afforestation, has been going on in the Department than in the period in which he was Minister. To pinpoint some of the claims that [359] Deputy Blowick made in that respect, I will refer to part of his speech. For one thing, Deputy Blowick suggested that the work on tourist roads which was initiated early this year and which was sponsored—and I am not saying this in a boastful manner—by my office was carried out at the expense of local authority works. I would like to remind Deputy Blowick that, in 1950-51, the last complete year in which he was Minister, the amount of the Road Fund grants to county councils was £2,265,000, at that stage a reduction of several hundred thousand pounds on the amount given to the Road Fund by the Fianna Fáil Government before it went out of office in 1948. The grant out of the Road Fund to county councils for the current year is £4,100,000 and when one adds to that the £400,000 special grant for the tourist roads which is being made available this year it brings the total sum to £4,500,000 in this single year——",22/10/1953,14,1513,1514,was trying to claim credit for work that was being done by a number of other Departments I can assure,Deputy Blowick,and the House that that is very far from the truth If my job is to ensure the economic and,Deputy Blowick,853759_5,,was trying to claim credit for work that was being done by a number of other Departments I can assure Deputy Blowick and the House that that is very far from the truth If my job is to ensure the economic and,was trying to claim credit for work that was being done by a number of other Departments I can assure and the House that that is very far from the truth If my job is to ensure the economic and,text455,0,4,0,0,40,0.1,4,2.197224577,0.054930614,0.600832755,0.015020819,0.94994995,0.974974975,0.978978979,0.923923924,0.982982983,0.947947948,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2589479,464,26,99,"Control of Dogs (Amendment) Bill, 1991: Committee Stage.",04/03/1992,Mr. Eamon Gilmore,The Workers' Party,Dún Laoghaire,"I contend this is a very good amendment. I am surprised the Minister has not taken it on board. Indeed, I am somewhat confused by his response. As Deputy Garland said, there is no definition of 'guard dog' in the Principal Act or in the Bill before us. Yet, in section 6 of the Bill before us — which replaces section 19 of the Principal Act — there are a number of very specific references to the term 'guard dog'. For example, it is proposed to enable the Minister to make regulations specifying the kinds of standards of premises in which a guard dog may be kept, to enable him make regulations providing for the registration of premises in which a guard dog can be kept. Two issues arise here. First, how does one define what is a 'guard dog'? There are many types of dogs which could be described as a 'guard dog'. In fact, in some respects I suppose any dog could be classified as a guard dog, but it is fair to assume that what are intended here are dogs kept specifically for the purpose of guarding premises, businesses or whatever at present the provisions virtually apply to premises of a commercial nature. However, there are cases where it is quite clear that a dog is being kept for the purposes of guarding a private dwelling. One need not travel very far to see sings on gateways 'beware of guard dog'. Unfortunately, such signs are becoming ever more common these days. The issue that arises here is that clearly those dogs are bought and kept for the purposes of guarding those particular premises. Will the Minister include in his regulations a requirement that domestic dwellings must be registered with the relevant local authority in order for example, that a householder, may keep an Alsatian, which some householders keep, or will he allow circumstances prevail in which dog wardens will be required to inspect domestic dwellings and the kinds of facilites provided in those dwellings for the retention of guard dogs? I know the Minister said that is not [1403] the intention but I am puzzled by section 6 (2) (c) which reads: make provision for the regulation of the use of guard dogs at or in the immediate vicinity of premises used wholly or mainly for the purposes of any business, profession or occupation I would assume that the term 'occupation' would relate to a domestic dwelling. The issue needs to be cleared up: what is or what is not a 'guard dog' do the regulations cover domestic dwellings or not? Could the provisions of this Bill be used, as many people fear, as an unwarranted intrusion into private dwellings and/or people's homes?",04/03/1992,26,29,30,I am surprised the Minister has not taken it on board Indeed I am somewhat confused by his response As,Deputy Garland,said there is no definition of guard dog in the Principal Act or in the Bill before us Yet in,Deputy Garland,2589479_1,,I am surprised the Minister has not taken it on board Indeed I am somewhat confused by his response As Deputy Garland said there is no definition of guard dog in the Principal Act or in the Bill before us Yet in,I am surprised the Minister has not taken it on board Indeed I am somewhat confused by his response As said there is no definition of guard dog in the Principal Act or in the Bill before us Yet in,text808,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.086962636,0.002174066,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.557557558,0.536536537,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4441977,2328,9,45,Upward-Only Rent Reviews (Continued),26/03/2013,Mr. Jim Daly,Fine Gael,Cork South-West,"I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for discussion today and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, for coming to the House to deal with it. I raised this issue in January with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, when the guidelines for issuing new driving licences were published. I have since been approached by several professional photographers seeking a clear, concise and logical reason they will not be permitted to supply images for the new driving licences. I have failed to date, based on the information available, to do so. To be fair, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, referred my earlier query to the Road Safety Authority, from which I received a substantive response. I also received a follow-up response from Mr. Noel Brett, CEO of the RSA, for which I am grateful. However, I remain unconvinced of the reasons given for centralising and monopolising this service. The main reasons for these changes were supplied to me and to the industry. The first is identity validation. I would have thought the presentation of a photograph to the Garda Síochána, which is duly stamped and signed by a garda, to be pretty tight security of identity. It could be argued that in handing over this authorisation to ordinary citizens - namely, staff of the RSA - we are weakening this security. The second reason is the need for the highest available standard of quality. I am sure it will take little to convince the Minister of State that professional photographers would have no problem providing images in any format, quality or specification, should they be afforded the opportunity to do so. The third reason is the provision of a faster and more effective service. To give this as a reason for the change is to highlight the lack of good, valid reasons. We are talking in this regard about the difference between postage times, which range from 12 to 24 hours nationally. In my opinion, this timescale will not alter customer satisfaction in any shape or form. I would argue that people will have to plan more time and possibly take a half day or a full day off work to attend an NDLS centre, which could be located up 50 km from them, thus prolonging the process for the applicant. In my experience, having discussed this issue over the past few months with local photographers, they are more than aware of the acceptable guidelines for driving licences and passports, which to date have been more particular than those for driving licences and demand a higher level of security. It was also stated that during the tender process bidders were afforded an opportunity to select paper or digital images, and all opted for digital images. This is hardly surprising. All businesses worldwide, as well as ordinary people, now opt to carry out their business online rather than by using paper, envelopes and stamps. I could possibly, but reluctantly, attempt to understand all of the above if it were not for the fact that in the context of the renewal of licences, all of these reasons go out the window. For example, as the end product in respect of a licence that is being renewed will be exactly the same as the original, the image is not an issue as a person could change somewhat over a ten-year period, it is also not an issue faster and more effective service to the customer is not an issue, and minimising the number of customers turned away also becomes irrelevant. I sought permission to raise this matter largely because of jobs. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, is at pains to cut red tape for small businesses, and indeed is succeeding. In contrast, this proposed change affects small businesses by preventing them from providing this service. Last year, almost 700,000 new licences were issued. At an average cost of €8 for photographs, this represents a loss of trade to the sector of between €5 million and €6 million, which is a very significant loss in the current economic climate. I urge the Minister to direct the RSA to review this matter so as to keep these jobs and revenues in local communities.",26/03/2013,31,609,610,becomes irrelevant I sought permission to raise this matter largely because of jobs The Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation,Deputy Bruton,is at pains to cut red tape for small businesses and indeed is succeeding In contrast this proposed change affects,Deputy Bruton,4441977_4,,becomes irrelevant I sought permission to raise this matter largely because of jobs The Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation Deputy Bruton is at pains to cut red tape for small businesses and indeed is succeeding In contrast this proposed change affects,becomes irrelevant I sought permission to raise this matter largely because of jobs The Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation is at pains to cut red tape for small businesses and indeed is succeeding In contrast this proposed change affects,text370,3,3,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.086962636,0.002174066,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.557557558,0.536536537,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1618991,402,9,92,Committee on Finance. - Development in the European Communities—Second Report: Motion (Resumed).,28/02/1974,Mr. Garret FitzGerald,Fine Gael,Dublin South-East,"We now come to the question of the facilities available to the committee and members of the European Parliament. The position is that the European Economic Community committee sought a large staff of 14. This request was so out of line with what I thought reasonable that the Minister for Finance decided a study should be carried out to find out what, in fact, are the needs of the Committee. My original thinking was that if they had a staff of five, including two people allocated to help the members of the European Parliament, they would, by the standards of this House, be very well staffed and the position could be reviewed after a certain length of time if that staff proved inadequate to cope. The committee in their wisdom chose to look for a staff of 14. The Minister for Finance reacted, understandably, by saying that he could not agree to this without a study being carried out. In the meantime the committee has a staff of two. The study commenced on 12th February and is expected to be completed in the next few weeks. I regret the delay. Whether the committee handled it wisely or well is a matter about which the House will have to make up its mind. By making a claim for a staff of 14 they created problems for themselves instead of solving them. No doubt the committee have a different view on this. I hope the study will show what the needs are and that they will be quickly met. [1847] I am particularly concerned that members of the European Parliament who have spoken in this House are unhappy with the service they are getting. This hold-up is connected with the staffing of the committee. It seemed to me that the two problems could best be tackled as one and the staff serving the European Parliament delegation, who are all members of the committee, should be closely associated with the secretariat of that committee. Perhaps that was a mistake and the two problems should have been tackled separately. It would have been better if the needs of the delegates had been tackled separately. That, of course, is speaking with hindsight. The present secretariat have the duty of keeping the European Parliament delegates and members of the committee informed. It may be that the staff of two are not in a position to do this adequately. I would not be surprised if that were the case. The staff of my Department are available to assist in matters of policy. It would be an improper use of my staff for them to be substituted for the work of the secretariat of the committee in providing factual data to members. Members are entitled to guidance on policy from all Departments and that will be given by officials and, where necessary, by Ministers. If members of the European Parliament wish to see me at some stage to discuss policy issues I am always available for that purpose. I will be glad to help any way I can within the limits of time available. I wonder if the position will ever be completely satisfactory if they have to handle all this themselves and take the initiative in seeking information and guidance in policy without having research assistance for that purpose. I am sympathetic with the points made in this House by members of the European Parliament. If I were a member of the European Parliament I am sure I would share their sense of frustration. I will do everything I can to ensure that they are given the necessary assistance to carry out their work, if they are not being put in a position to do that work as effectively as we would [1848] like to have it done. We have a responsibility to see to that and I will do anything I can to help to get that problem resolved as rapidly as possible. If it is partly my fault that their problems have become tied up with those of the committee I am sorry in retrospect that I ever suggested that the two should be brought together in that way though at the time it seemed a reasonable suggestion. I hope we can help them to resolve these problems. The House, in my view, has been impressed by what it has heard about the problems they face. I am aware of the strain there must be on these Deputies in travelling. Whatever burden of travel I have it is worse for them, they have more travelling to do than I. I do not seem ever to travel in a plane in the general direction of Brussels, Luxembourg, and Strasbourg without meeting Deputies going backwards or forwards. They have not the advantage a Minister has of having staff available to him. Even their travel is sometimes more difficult than it is for a Minister whose path is often smoothed in various ways en route. The problem of coping with the unfamiliar procedure of another Parliament, the linguistic problems, which the Deputies face are all very serious and are aggravated by problems such as the inadequacy of the telephone link with Europe and the fact that they do not seem to get Irish daily newspapers until some days later with the result that they are out of touch with what is happening at home. All these create serious problems for them and it is the duty of this House. and the Government, to give them every assistance they can in carrying out their very difficult task. This debate, which has been useful in many ways, has been particularly useful in highlighting these problems and in putting pressure on us all to get them resolved to the satisfaction of the Deputies concerned. The points made by Deputies about linguistic problems are certainly valid. There is no doubt that we are not well equipped for this purpose. None of us really has the range of languages which is necessary to be 100 per cent effective in this multi-lingual environment. [1849] I share the sense of frustration of Deputies in this. I have no German and I find myself from time to time at meetings where the informal discussions are carried on in German. It is a case of either having to switch to English for my benefit, which may inhibit the conversation somewhat, or else I am left unable to know what is being said. Other Deputies have similar problems with French. This does leave us at a disadvantage and Deputies have stressed the importance of developing our educational system so that it is normal for educated Irish people to have a fluency in foreign languages like French and German as it is normal for most of the educated nationals of these countries. Those Deputies are right to stress this need. Deputy Thornley mentioned the problem posed for all countries in Europe by multi-national companies and their activities. This is something of which we have been rendered more conscious by the energy crisis. I support Deputy Thornley in what he said on this. We supported the initiative of the Danish Government in asking to have this matter studied within the Community framework and in Washington we also supported and pressed, for the inclusion of studies of the activities of multi-nationals as part of the work to be undertaken arising out of the Washington energy conference. This is something about which European countries generally are concerned. It was not listed by the United States amongst the topics to be considered and we had the job of ensuring that it was added as an eighth item to the list of seven topics they had mentioned and ensuring that it was not narrowed down because there was proposal that one should only look at the future activities of multi-nationals. The European countries at Washington were not prepared to accept that and that proposed limitation was removed by agreement. We are pressing that this matter should be studied at expert level, not merely studied by the co-ordinating group itself at a level of generality. I can assure Deputy Thornley that both in relation to the energy crisis and the [1850] general European industrial situation we are concerned to ensure that multi-national companies have to act in a transparent manner so that the Governments in the countries in which they are operating know what they are doing and they have to carry their fair share of taxation and that they do not become a power over and above and beyond that of Governments. I should now like to come to the question of regional policy. Deputy O'Kennedy raised this matter in a somewhat contentious way when he spoke. He was critical of our handling of regional policy and I should like to take up what he said because I think that in his mind there was a certain amount of chronological confusion. He said that I was at fault—I am referring to Volume 269 of the Official Report, column 710, of the 29th November—because this country was aware of rumours and suggestions and I did not state my position in the House or take Members into my confidence or get public opinion behind me until it was too late. Deputy O'Kennedy said then that if I could give evidence of statements made during that period he would be glad to acknowledge it. That is the fault he imputed to me. For himself he spoke about Fianna Fáil convening a special meeting during the summer break to make a statement on the matter. He referred to the arguments which they put forward in August. Later, in response to an interjection, he referred to the Fianna Fáil statement appearing in the Press sometime in late August. The picture painted by Deputy O'Kennedy is that of a negligent Minister for Foreign Affairs idling away his time on other matters from May to September while in August a vigilant Fianna Fáil Party, aware of the rumours and reports circulating in Europe, took action in the matter to alert the country to the problems facing Ireland in regard to the regional policy. It is a dramatic picture, it is an attractive picture from an Opposition point of view, but it is unfortunately based on several chronological errors which totally invalidate it. [1851] The fact is that the Fianna Fáil meeting which Deputy O'Kennedy twice described as having taken place in August took place on Thursday, 13th September, and the statement issued was reported in The Irish Times of 14th September. The vigilance of the Fianna Fáil Party was not such apparently as to note the statement I issued on 24th July. Deputy O'Kennedy said that I said nothing and if there was any evidence of statements he would be glad to hear about it. It would have been a little better if the Fianna Fáil Party had noted the statement I issued to the Press on 24th July and, having taken a leisurely 7½ weeks to consider that statement, it would have been a good thing if they had taken an account of that in the statement they issued 7½ weeks later. The statement I issued arose when these rumours developed for the first time, rumours to the effect that the July proposals of the Commission, due to come out at the end of July, would not, in fact, reflect the thinking of the Commission which we endorsed and found satisfactory in its document in the month of May. The first rumours to that effect appeared in the Press on a day when the Council of Ministers was meeting in Brussels. They were drawn to my attention immediately. Before that meeting ended, and without any delay I personally drafted a statement, had it typed and issued it to the Press. This is the statement which was issued on that date: My attention has been drawn to speculation in the Press in regard to the possible size of the EEC regional fund and the extent to which Ireland might expect to benefit from it. It is my understanding that the Commission has not yet decided what it will propose to the Council of Ministers in this matter. The position, of course, following the normal Community procedure is that the Commission will make proposals in due course and that the Council of Ministers will then make the necessary decision. [1852] Regional policy is concerned with the transfer of adequate resources from richer to less developed areas in order to promote a balanced economic evolution in the Community as a whole. This was particularly emphasised at the summit meeting of heads of State or of Government last October, which said that resources of the fund must be such that, co-ordinated with national resources they would correct the principal regional imbalances in the enlarged Community during the course of the development of the economic and monetary union, namely by 1980. I am convinced that the Council Minister will carry out this mandate of the summit meeting which would, of course, imply a transfer of resources to Ireland far greater than the relatively negligible sum mentioned in Irish newspaper reports. When the matter comes to the Council, I shall, if proposals are made by the Commission, which fall short of the summit decision, make absolutely clear the Irish Government's position in respect to this commitment of the summit. A proper regional policy is a vital interest to Ireland, whose operation on an adequate scale would be a necessary pre-condition of progress towards the achievement of economic and monetary union. I do not think I could have acted with greater speed. Within a couple of short hours of the rumours being published, I had this statement issued sounding a note of warning to the Commission on the proposals they might adopt if the proposals being put to them took the form mentioned in the newspaper reports, the first newspaper reports on the subject. The promptitude of my reaction was in somewhat marked contrast with the leisurely process by which Fianna Fáil over a period of seven and a half weeks considered the matter and finally issued a statement on 13th September. For Deputy O'Kennedy to tell this House that I said nothing between May and September, and that Fianna Fáil issued a statement in August is, with respect, the height of impertinence. [1853] It is such a travesty of facts that it is something which one would not normally expect to be done by a responsible Member of the Opposition. No doubt if Deputy O'Kennedy were here he would say he forgot that it was in September and not in August he issued his statement, that he was unaware of the fact that I had issued a statement, and that when he denounced me for not doing so he had not got around to checking. That is not the way a responsible Opposition act. Criticisms of this kind on the handling of a matter by the Government should be more firmly founded on fact than the fiction put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy here on 29th November. I am sorry I have had to wait three months to put the record right. Unfortunately, the debate—a good and useful debate—was broken by the Christmas interval and is taking place now at the end of February. I did not have the opportunity in that time to put things right. I hope the Press will give the same publicity to the facts about this as was given to the travesty of the facts put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy in the debate on 29th November. On the question of regional policy there are several other things I should like to say. First of all, I think from the debate there is some confusion about the nature of a regional policy. Deputies seem to have an impression that the European Commission will start new schemes in certain parts of the country, pumping large sums of money in which were not previously being pumped in. That is not the nature of this scheme. What this scheme does is to aid and assist financially member governments with schemes they operate. We have in existence schemes of this kind because, on the one hand, we have grants given to industry from our own financial resources and, on the other hand, the State provides infrastructure for industrial and tourist development in various parts of the country. What the Regional Fund will do will be to reimburse us for part of these costs, thereby enabling us to pursue these policies more extensively and on a larger scale. The question [1854] of where this extension takes place and how we reorientate our policy towards particular parts of the country is entirely a matter for us. It is up to this Government to decide that, given the increase in resources coming to us by way of reimbursement of the existing pattern of expenditure, we will first enlarge this expenditure by at least the amount of the additional aid given and secondly reorientate it towards part of the country where the need is greatest. We will, of course, be claiming money back in respect of grants given. If grants are given in County Wicklow for industry, or in County Louth, we will put in our claim for reimbursement of the share of industrial grants in these cases just as we will in the west. If Deputies are thinking that we will be operating this scheme in relation to the west only they are wrong. We must operate it in respect of anywhere we give assistance or grants, and are entitled to get the money back. We have to get the maximum amount of money back. When we get the money it means that our expenditure on these schemes, industrial grants and infrastructure for industrial and tourist development, will be relieved by that amount. We will be enabled therefore to extend these schemes and have them on a larger scale. In doing that we must re-direct our policy towards the west and north-west, neglected for so long under Fianna Fáil, and ensure that there is an adequate regional development programme in those areas which there has not been for the past 16 years. We must use Irish money made available by the relief of the existing Irish schemes in all parts of the country to operate an adequate and generous regional policy in the west and the north-west. Deputies should be clear that that is how the scheme works. It is in reimbursement of existing expenditure by us in every part of the country. thereby releasing resources enabling us to put a bigger effort into the areas that really need it. It is we who decide that. If the regional policy adopted in two or three years time is regarded as unsatisfactory, there is no alibi for [1855] us in the EEC. We will be responsible for the policy as to where the money goes, not the EEC. That must be clearly said. It is up to us in Government to prepare an adequate regional policy and use the extra resources made available by the reimbursement of Irish expenditure throughout the whole country to have an adequate regional programme in the west and north-west. That is what we propose to do. When people ask have we schemes ready, there is misunderstanding. It is the existing schemes in operation which will be reimbursed. My worry is not that the scale of our existing industrial grant and infrastructure provisions will not be sufficient to claim back the amount of money allocated to us. My worry is to the contrary: that the way in which this policy has evolved and the proportion of the money which is to be allocated to countries with much lesser needs than ours is such that the total sum available will not be sufficient to reimburse the level of activity and will not bring us sufficient extra money to enable us to do what we need to do in the parts of the country which have been so long neglected under the previous Government. I am glad to have the opportunity of making clear, I hope, how the Regional Fund works. It is important that people should be clear on this. On the question of our attitude to the fund I am glad to have the opportunity of explaining to the House the stage we have reached. The position is that the scheme as put forward in July by the Commission allocated virtually half the total resources in effect to Britain and France. The Commissioner for Regional Policy has on a number of occasions—quite bluntly and frankly, it must be said—explained this allocation in terms of political need and the need to take account of political reality. It is our view that while the European Commission must be conscious of political reality and must not put forward starry-eyed proposals which are not capable of securing support it is wrong for them to have such regard for political so-called reality [1856] as to produce a scheme which is unrelated to genuine need in Europe for a regional policy. We do not accept that the scheme as put forward was adequately designed for this purpose. The fact that half the money was, in effect, allocated to Britain and France—two countries which are not among the poorest in Europe, nor are they the countries which have the major problems—meant so far as we were concerned that the scheme was basically wrongly designed. Our criticism of it on those grounds has, I am afraid, been upheld in an unfortunate way in that the German Government share this view so strongly that they are not prepared to provide the sums of money necessary to provide a fund twice as large, roughly, as what is needed to deal with the problems of Ireland and Italy and certain areas of difficulty like Greenland, in order to hand over funds to their great commercial rivals Britain and France. So, this triangular conflict has evolved with the British Government anxious to have a Regional Fund out of which Britain would get a large sum of money to help to persuade public opinion that the EEC is a more attractive proposition economically than British public opinion now thinks it is the French Government anxious to ensure that France should not secure from the fund anything less than Britain and the German Government unwilling to subsidise on this scale their great commercial rivals Britain and France. That is a triangle which it is our job to flatten into a straight line of some kind, but it is very difficult to flatten it into a straight line, just as it is difficult to square a circle. In December at a meeting of the Council of Ministers I made a proposal designed as far as possible to reconcile these conflicting points of view. I had already put forward a proposal showing what we would seek from the fund if it were on the scale proposed by the European Commission, that is, 2,250 million units of account over a three year period. In December, faced with this conflict, in an attempt to resolve it I put forward a compromise proposal which [1857] had three features. First, it managed to do what was necessary with a fund 600 million units of account smaller than that proposed by the Commission thereby going a long way—I felt far enough, but apparently it was not the view of the German Government—to meet the viewpoint of the German Government, a fund of 1,650 million units of account. It provided the same net benefit to Italy and the United Kingdom as the original fund so the net transfer—that is the gross transfer less the gross contribution to the fund— to those two countries would be approximately the same as the Commission proposed, and the net transfer to Ireland would be twice what the Commission had proposed because the Commission's proposal in the case of Ireland was grossly inadequate. That proposal was received as a useful contribution to the debate. Unfortunately, it did not receive the endorsement of Germany as regards the sum of money. Germany is not yet willing to give a sum of that magnitude. However, the proposal was well received as a compromise of compromises, showing what could be done with a smaller fund than the Commission had proposed and providing equal benefits for Britain and Italy and substantially greater for us. It made clear what we thought appropriate in the Irish instance. In that debate there was a clear acceptance by the President of the Council of Ministers and by Commissioner Thomson that the Irish case was a special case that needed special treatment. The case we put forward, that every part of Ireland is a region in need of aid, that we have no part of the country from which to draw resources and, therefore, unlike all the other member countries we are in a unique position and require additional aid beyond what any so-called objective criteria may seem to show, was accepted in principle by the President of the Council and by Commissioner Thomson it was not demurred at or disagreed with by representatives of any other country present. That is not to say that the proposal [1858] I made for the doubling of the Irish share was accepted but only that the principle was accepted, that whichever of the various systems of criteria were applied they would need adjustment to give Ireland more than the amount that would emerge from the different criteria because of our special need. Unfortunately, agreement has not been reached on the Regional Fund. The German Government have not been willing to provide a sum of 1,650 million units of account. It is arithmetically impossible to give to the United Kingdom and Italy similar net benefits and to give to Ireland the additional benefits we need out of a smaller fund. The conflict remains between the German Government who are only willing to provide a smaller sum, the British Government who are anxious to ensure that the net benefit to them will be as great as the Commission proposed, the French Government anxious to ensure that their net contribution to the fund will not be unduly enlarged beyond the very small figure proposed by the Commission, the Italian Government trying to ensure that they get at least what the Commission proposed, and the Irish Government trying to ensure we get additional assistance over and above what the Commission proposed. The conflict between these interests is not easy to resolve. The division in the Community at the Washington energy conference has not helped the situation because it led immediately to the postponement of the meeting on 18th February of the Council of Ministers at which regional policy was to be discussed. I cannot bring the House any further on this at this time. As there has not been a meeting of the Council of Ministers since the Washington conference it is not clear what is the mood of the different countries or what are the prospects of getting agreement on this or any other Community policy. I shall be attending Council of Ministers meetings on Monday and Tuesday next, preceded by a meeting of the Political Committee of Foreign Ministers discussing political co-operation. After that we will have a clearer picture of [1859] the mood of the Community in the post-Washington period, of the extent to which member countries regard as very serious the conflict that arose in the Community, or the extent to which they show a desire to smooth over those difficulties, to re-establish the unity of the Community, unhappily broken at the Washington conference. At this stage I cannot express to the House any views on the speed with which we will resolve the question of regional policy or the likely terms. I can only say this—it is important that it be said—unless proposals emerge that are significantly more favourable to this country, particularly in terms of the percentage share of the fund and also the absolute sum of money involved, than that put forward by the Commission it will not be possible for the Irish Government to accept the proposals. There should not be any doubt in anyone's mind on this point. It would not be to our advantage to agree to a regional policy on the lines proposed by the Commission. If necessary—I hope it will not be necessary—it is better that we put a spoke in the wheel at this stage, insist that the matter be further considered and a more genuine regional policy emerge, better designed to reach the needs of countries like Ireland and Italy, than to accept a scheme that would relegate us to a position of relative insignificance in terms of benefits from the scheme which should have been designed primarily for countries such as Ireland and Italy. At this stage I cannot tell the House if there will be a regional policy or if there are proposals put forward which we could accept. I cannot tell the House that it may not be necessary in the ultimate analysis for this country to use its veto if a proposal unsatisfactory to us is put forward and accepted by other countries. All this remains ahead of us perhaps we will have a clearer idea by Tuesday night on where we stand. There were other general questions raised with which I should like to [1860] deal. Deputy Wilson wondered if economic and monetary union would suit us. This is a question that is not susceptible of a simple answer. In one sense, not only would it suit us but something of the kind is essential for us. Unless there is a monetary union involving fixed parties of currencies the CAP will remain at the mercy of parity shifts between member countries. We will remain in the position of being unable to get the full benefit of the CAP because of changes in parities and the operation of monetary compensation adjustments, such as exist as present. Already we are in the position where the effective value of the unit of account is quite different from what it was when fixed for the purposes of the CAP and we are losing significant sums in terms of domestic purchasing power as a result. So long as the Community remain at the mercy of these parity shifts, as long as there is not a monetary union strong enough to withstand shocks and sure enough to maintain the parties of the different currencies as fixed, the CAP will have an element of insecurity and it will not bring the benefits to the farmers of this country that it should bring. More than anyone else, except possibly France, we have an interest in the coming into existence of a monetary union. At the same time, we must recognise that if a monetary union evolved in the immediate future, without an adequate regional policy to help us to accept the strains that would be imposed on our economy, it could create great problems for us. We want to see a strong, worthwhile regional union that will ensure the survival and success of the CAP. To secure these two aims in that order are the principal economic objectives of Ireland in the Community. At the same time, in examining the approaches made by other countries to the question of monetary union it seems to me at times that other countries who have not had our experience in the past 50 years of operating a de facto monetary union are not totally clear about the implications of such a union or on the steps necessary to achieve it. Last April, at the Council [1861] of Ministers, I endeavoured to draw the attention of other Minister to this, to point out to them that some of the thinking behind the monetary union proposals is, in economic terms, simpliste, and dangerously so. I have endeavoured to point out that the achievement of monetary union can be secured only if the economies of member countries and their institutional structures in terms of wage negotiations, for example, are assimilated to each other. So long as member countries have different rates of inflation, deriving from totally separate processes of wage and salary bargaining, not even influenced by each other through a lack of transparency brought about by the different currency units, so long as that situation exists it will be difficult to maintain parity between currencies. We hope to make a contribution to thinking on monetary union, to deepen that thinking and to make it a little more sophisticated. We hope to use the experience we have had from a de facto monetary union for the last 50 years in order to contribute to the evolution of monetary union in Europe that will protect the CAP. By helping in that educational process we hope there will be a regional policy strengthening our economy and enabling it to stand up to the pressures and shocks to which it will be subject within a monetary union. That is the best answer I can give in a tentative way to the question posed by Deputy Wilson on monetary union. Deputy O'Kennedy raised a question about political co-operation in the Community. Here again Deputy O'Kennedy betrayed some confusion of thought. He seemed to think this was something completely new, in which this Government had become involved. He said 'Most of us were surprised to know of these consultations'. These are consultations referred to in page 7 of the report where reference is made to the fact that a wide range of topics has been discussed by this political committee, consultations in the field of foreign policy and so on. He said 'Most of us were surprised to know of these consultations' and went on to imply [1862] that this was something new which had not existed previously. I am surprised at this because the fact is that these consultations are something which have existed in the Community for many years past. Indeed, before we joined the Community the then Government participated in these discussions and there were two meetings attended by Dr. Hillery, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the 26-27 May, 1972, and on 20-21 November, 1972. At these meetings discussions took place on the Middle East, Mediterranean policy, the Conference for Security and Co-operation i","","","","","","","","","",,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958—Second Stage (Resumed).",16/12/1958,Mr. John (Jack) McQuillan,Clann na Poblachta,Roscommon,"I shall not go into it any further. I might be in order in giving a second quotation from the same Minister. It is one from the same Dáil Debate. I should like to know whether there is a mistake in the facts, or whether the Minister in prepared to stand over them. At column 1640, Deputy Childers, the Minister for Lands, is reported:— 'There is hardly a country in the world with our system of government that has not gained enormously in prosperity, where production has not increased and where poverty has not diminished. Nobody can point to any country, as I have said, where this system operates which has faltered disatrously or where there are problems which have not have been solved or at least some effort has not been made to solve them.' Is that not the best argument that can be used in favour of the present system? He says that there is hardly a country in the world with our system of government that has not gained enormously in prosperity, where production has not increased and where poverty has not diminished. What is the idea of the change? Deputies, including the present Minister for Health, have put forward the plausible argument that the simple method of election is the best. I should like to deal with some simple signs regarding the simple system. Any Deputy who happens to be present when the votes are being counted has only to look at the boxes when the checking is taking place and he will see 1, 2, 3, 4, coming out of the boxes, as if out of a factory, for the four Fianna Fáil candidates, if there happen to be four in the constituency. If there are only three, the papers will come out marked 1, 2, 3, for the Fianna Fáil candidates all in a row. The people who voted for those candidates knew the system. They were able to stop at 3 or 4, depending on the number of Fianna Fáil candidates. [2262] Is it not a fact that Fianna Fáil trained those people into doing that? Is it not a fact that that system and that canvass arrangement adopted by Fianna Fáil was a slur on the system of P. R. enshrined in the Constitution? No sooner had they put it into the Constitution than they sent their henchmen around the country to get the people to vote only so far down the list as the Fianna Fáil candidates' names went. That system, with the Fianna Fáil people, worked, as the Taoiseach said it worked fairly well up to recent years. It was adequate. The people who were supporting Fianna Fáil stopped voting when they had given a vote to the last Fianna Fáil candidate. But in recent years in spite of the rigid discipline and authoritarian tactics of the Fianna Fáil Party, the humble Fianna Fáil supporter was no longer cowed and he began to give preferences outside the Fianna Fáil Party. He began in many places to give a preference to a Fine Gael man. When the Fianna Fáil voting experts saw this happening, they realised the danger to the Party. As we know, they have experts all over this country, in every county. They have excellent men whose job it is to report back on how the people feel and as to the way they are likely to vote. The picture painted by the Fianna Fáil organisers to headquarters was that the old bitterness of the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil set up was breaking down and that the Fianna Fáil supporters in many instances were beginning to throw preferences to Fine Gael. Is that not true? That cannot be denied.",16/12/1958,16,575,576,on how the people feel and as to the way they are likely to vote The picture painted by the,Fianna Fáil,organisers to headquarters was that the old bitterness of the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil set up was breaking down and that,Fianna Fáil,989636_16,,on how the people feel and as to the way they are likely to vote The picture painted by the Fianna Fáil organisers to headquarters was that the old bitterness of the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil set up was breaking down and that,on how the people feel and as to the way they are likely to vote The picture painted by the organisers to headquarters was that the old bitterness of the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil set up was breaking down and that,text222,2,0,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-1.609437912,-0.040235948,-0.324037035,-0.008100926,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.024024024,0.067067067,0.053053053,0.083083083,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2299649,719,21,92,"An Bille um an Deichi&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1987: An Coiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1987: Committee and Final Stages.",24/04/1987,Mr. Michael McDowell,Progressive Democrats,Dublin South-East,"I take issue with what the Minister has just said in relation to the wording of Article 29. 4.3º. I concur with his views that Article 29 as originally intended was supposed to be a complete statement of independence in the foreign policy sphere for the Government and the Dáil. As Mr. de Valera articulated so forcefully, it was originally conceived by him to put the conduct of foreign policy on to a very liberal and independent basis, free from the shackles of constitutional control as far as possible. Both the Minister and I heard a recording of Mr. de Valera's voice stating precisely that in a recent radio programme on the issue. I hope Deputy Birmingham does not consider me ungracious or sniping, but one of the real problems with Article 29 is the phraseology of its third paragraph. What I would term the FitzGerald amendment in 1972 took out the words 'consequent on our membership' and put in the phrase 'necessitated by obligations of membership' and that has caused a good deal of the chaos which has subsequently ensued. To be fair to Deputy FitzGerald, he understood what he was doing then. Deputy FitzGerald was making a very restrictive proposal by suggesting to the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lynch, that the words 'consequent on' were flexible and would allow the Government and the Dáil to move on to further policy areas other than those originally contemplated by the 1972 Treaty. The curious thing is that the record of this House of 25 January 1972 shows that Deputy FitzGerald understood then that there was a possibility in the future that a foreign policy treaty would be negotiated between the parties to the EC Treaties and he explicitly said that the reason he was putting in and urging the Government [2569] to put the necessitated obligations phraseology into Article 29. 4.3º was to prevent such a treaty from being entered into because, in his view, that would be a matter which should properly require a referendum. I know that the political roundabout in its many revolutions puts people on the opposite sides of arguments which they supported perhaps ten or 15 years ago and that Deputy FitzGerald now finds himself arguing against the case which the Supreme Court made out for him eventually. Deputy FitzGerald actually foresaw the Walsh/Henchy/Hederman thinking and encouraged it to be so, and secured the agreement of the Taoiseach of the day to an amendment in order to necessitate and copperfasten the kind of judgment which emerged from the Supreme Court now. It is not worth our while running away from that. If the price of Fine Gael support then for the European Communities amendment was to accede to this tightening of the wording, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, was willing to pay that price to secure all party agreement. It is an extraordinary irony that the Opposition parties here today are asking for the exact opposite. The Progressive Democrats are asking the Government to undo the FitzGerald amendment and to bring into Article 29. 4.3º this element of flexibility. Doubtless, Deputy FitzGerald in all good faith thought that to confine and constrict the power of this Chamber and the Government was a good thing at that time and that it was a good thing to phrase the amendment to the Constitution that was then effected so as to require a referendum if there was a foreign policy treaty. Whatever the rights or wrongs of Deputy FitzGerald's thinking then, and obviously his thinking has undergone a change because he certainly was not giving out the same message the other night, and whatever the rights or wrongs of the Government acceding to the siren voices for unity that were coming from Fine Gael at the time, and making this restrictive amendment, we are now in the position that [2570] Article 29. 4.3.º with its necessitated obligations formula unduly restricts the development of the European Communities. With respect to Deputy Birmingham's amendment, which is clever, it does not deal with this necessitated obligations thing at all. It leaves it high and dry and for instance the European Patents Convention, which is not a necessitated obligation and which purports to give powers to the West German courts which have a binding effect on Irish citizens' injunctive powers, is clearly unconstitutional. We cannot ratify that convention precisely because it is not a necessitated obligation but it is quite clearly consequent on our membership of the European Community. We would be able to ratify it if the original wording had been left in place and if Fine Gael had not exacted the restriction as the price of support for the proposal to amend the Constitution then. The Minister did not at any stage reply to my challenge to prove me wrong and did not vindicate his own views. If the necessitated obligations formula is construed on its fact, we are still left with the position that in 1973 this House decided to amend the European Communities Act. It is worth stating that in 1972 it was provided that the implementation of European regulations in Irish law would be done by statute and that this House would legislate for the implementation of European regulations, directives and so on. In 1973 it was decided that that was a cumbersome thing and that it should be done by ministerial order and an amending Act was passed in 1973 to that effect. Going back to the original Treaties, the exact manner in which they implemented such directives and regulations was left in our discretion and therefore it is a curious fact, but legally undeniable, that it cannot be argued that in exercising a discretion to do it by regulation rather than by legislation we were not carrying out a necessitated obligation under the treaty. One cannot say if one chooses one mode of legislation rather than another, when one is given a choice, that the [2571] choice made is a necessitated choice so the consequence of all that is that a number of other judgments of the Supreme Court — City View Press and AnCO, and a few others — established clearly that ministerial legislation, quite apart from European law, is unconstitutional and if it is not a necessitated obligation, the 1973 Act has to stand on its own like any other domestic legislation. We are still left with the position, unfortunately, that however attractive Article 29 seems to the Minister in its drafting, it invalidates the 1973 procedure of implementing European law in this State. The consequence of that is that undoubtedly, somebody somewhere, especially when he reads it as a fourpage passage in a text book, will dream up an action to knock down some European regulation made under the 1973 Act. It is bound to suit somebody to do so. Perhaps some lorry driver who objects to his tachograph being the subject matter of a criminal prosecution will knock the regulation and the Act with it if it is in his interest so to do. As long as the necessitated obligations formula is retained in Article 29. 4.3º that procedure is clearly constitutionally invalid and vulnerable. I am suggesting to the Minister that we are now afforded an opportunity to recast Article 29. 4.3º. Even accepting for one minute the Minister's logic, that is, let us get this Single European Act out of the way, then roll up our constitutional, legal and jurisprudentialist sleeves, sit down together in a more amicable atmosphere than prevailed in this House this morning, let us sit down and put our collective wisdom — if that is what we have — to the task of redrawing the Articles of the Constitution with a view to taking the Crotty decision into account, is it seriously contended that we will put another referendum to the people this year? Supposing everybody here, in a spirit of national co-operation, putting the national interest first, sits down around a table, supposing we are advised at great length by the best constitutional lawyers [2572] in the land, some of them in this House and some outside it, supposing they all come, in their collective wisdom, to a formula which is undeniably apposite to meet the implications of the Crotty decision on every front, is the Minister seriously suggesting that in the autumn of this year the people are to be dragged to the polls again to implement that change in the Constitution? I do not know what kind of momentum the political process has in Ireland but I do not believe that the people's patience would remain in place if they were called to the polls twice in one year to deal with the same decision of the Supreme Court, on a second occasion, to have to do it properly, in a thoughtful and comprehensive way. I do not believe that will happen. Although the Minister is articulating a spirit of goodwill here about the possibility of getting the thing right in a reflective manner, doing it as a matter of urgency — presumably urgency means within a year even within the slow state of Irish politics — I question seriously whether there will be sufficient political will on the part of the people opposite, indeed on the part of the people at large, to put together a second referendum. Is it seriously contended that the business of the country is to be interrupted for a second time this year, with another referendum process to be set in train, when on that occasion every head banger of every kind will be able to parade his or her — and probably more 'her' than 'his'— particular fears about the implications of this?",24/04/1987,25,768,769,European Community We would be able to ratify it if the original wording had been left in place and if,Fine Gael,had not exacted the restriction as the price of support for the proposal to amend the Constitution then The Minister,Fine Gael,2299649_13,,European Community We would be able to ratify it if the original wording had been left in place and if Fine Gael had not exacted the restriction as the price of support for the proposal to amend the Constitution then The Minister,European Community We would be able to ratify it if the original wording had been left in place and if had not exacted the restriction as the price of support for the proposal to amend the Constitution then The Minister,text755,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.252982213,0.006324555,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.821821822,0.768768769,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

O'Donnell speaking in the Budget debate from the Front Bench concluded his speech by saying 'Deo gratias'. He was making a comparison between Tammany Hall and Fianna Fáil.

2499776,182,8,131,Situation in Agriculture: Statements.,25/10/1990,Mr. Peadar Clohessy,Fianna Fáil,Limerick East,"The Progressive Democrats accept fully that Irish farmers are in the throes of one of their worst income crises for years. Many are finding it difficult to provide for their families or retain their land. Many are surviving only by selling off stock and living on the capital derived therefrom. There is no need to go down the list of statistics on farm incomes to be aware of the crisis. Every farmer selling a bullock or heifer, a gallon of milk, a ewe or lamb, or a tonne of grain knows only too well how prices have fallen since the beginning of the year. They are confronted by a serious problem. Even people outside the farm community are aware that farming is suffering drastically. Teagasc have forecast that farm incomes for 1990 will decline by more than 20 per cent. That is a frightening prediction for people engaged in small category farming. The question is not whether there is an income crisis but rather what can be done about it, especially in the short term. Action is [445] needed on the part of our Government and the EC in Brussels. Measures to tackle the problem obtaining can be effective only if taken against a background of good overall economic management. Since the foundation of our party the Progressive Democrats economic and taxation policies have wrought large improvements nationally. Had we not managed to bring our inflation rate down to being one of the lowest in Europe the effects of the fall in agricultural prices would be even worse. We need only remember what happened when inflation was well into double figures. According to the OECD 40 pence only in every pound expended by the EC reaches farmers' pockets. Therefore, more of this money must go where it is needed, to the farmers themselves. Too much is being lost to middlemen who have grown wealthy at the expense of farmers. That is why also headage payments should be increased in line with the overall increases in the Structural Funds and the relevant payments brought forward. In addition, those with low incomes in the most disadvantaged regions should obtain most assistance. The extension of disadvantaged areas has taken too long to be resolved. On the basis of information leaked by some Deputies in a totally unsatisfactory manner, farmers are very angry at the manner in which the proposed new boundaries have been drawn up. Of course mistakes can be made but the Minister must establish a properly constituted appeals system enabling farmers who feel they have been unfairly excluded to represent their cases. Farmers on bad land with low incomes have been excluded from the newly drawn up disadvantaged areas and cannot understand why this should be so. The agreed Programme for Government negotiated between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in July 1989 states specifically — on the insistence of the Progressive Democrats — that an appeals system be introduced in borderline areas so that the justification of decisions in given areas can be understood and be subjected to scrutiny. That [446] appeals system must be implemented. The Council of Ministers at EC level need to have the new reclassification sorted out as quickly as possible. EC direct income aids have been promised. In respect of cereals they were agreed by the EC Heads of Government in 1988. However, some farmers have no chance of providing for their families, not to mention merely surviving in farming, without direct assistance. I contend that, where necessary, social welfare officers must adopt a liberal approach to their problems. The Government can act independently of the EC in helping such farmers for whom debt repayment has become a significant burden. The availability of Euro currency loans, with the exchange risk being underwritten by the State, would help enormously in such cases. Also within the ERM mechanism the State's exposure should be minimal. In addition, farmers whose herds have been affected by TB are also in need of help. The overall advisory and research service operated by Teagasc has never been more important. Intensive advice, based on good research back-up, can ameliorate many of the farmers' difficulties. Teagasc and its predecessor, ACOT, have been affected by severe cutbacks. They must be allowed provide a cost-effective service. In the longer term we shall have to pay much greater attention to the marketing of our food, exploiting the excellent quality of the basic raw materials from our farms. Selling into intervention will no longer give farmers an adequate return. The whole of the industry will have to turn its attention to adding value, exploiting our clean environment, penetrating the sophisticated high-value markets worldwide. Such will be our best long term guarantee of prosperity. To prevent the present crisis from worsening the Government must continue to defend the Common Agricultural Policy from US attempts to dismantle it within the GATT negotiations. Finally I must request the Minister to publish the list of disadvantaged areas [447] and introduce an appeals system, thereby enabling poorer farmers with bad quality land to avail of this facility.",25/10/1990,26,218,219,be effective only if taken against a background of good overall economic management Since the foundation of our party the,Progressive Democrats,economic and taxation policies have wrought large improvements nationally Had we not managed to bring our inflation rate down to,Progressive Democrats,2499776_2,,be effective only if taken against a background of good overall economic management Since the foundation of our party the Progressive Democrats economic and taxation policies have wrought large improvements nationally Had we not managed to bring our inflation rate down to,be effective only if taken against a background of good overall economic management Since the foundation of our party the economic and taxation policies have wrought large improvements nationally Had we not managed to bring our inflation rate down to,text392,1,3,0,0,40,0.05,2,0.84729786,0.021182447,0.333620293,0.008340507,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.651651652,0.63963964,0.893893894,0.841841842,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001: Second Stage (Resumed).",12/04/2001,Mr. John Bruton,Fine Gael,Meath,"Hear, hear. Mr. Hayes: I have a number of criticisms to make of the Government's handling of European affairs. It is profoundly wrong that this refer[1153] endum will take place on the same day as three other referenda proposed by the Government. That is a bad mistake. It will increase confusion and swell the 'no' votes on the day. I know the Government is intent on including this referendum with the other three but I appeal to it to reconsider. We have a great deal of time because the treaty does not have to be ratified until December 2002. The accession countries still have to conclude their negotiations. We have until December 2002 to ratify the treaty. We have a great deal of time and we should tread carefully. We should not hold the referendum on the same day as the three other referenda. Unlike others, I am not fearful of the result. People understand the internal logic at the heart of Europe and the concessions which must be made in terms of sovereignty and pooling resources to get the best result for Ireland. I am critical of the Government because it has asked the people for submissions on the treaty, yet it has not sent them the booklet explaining the treaty. A revised or toned down version of the White Paper, on whose clarity I compliment the Government, could be sent to every household in the country and submissions could then be invited. However, the Government has done it the other way around. It has asked for submissions first without sending people a copy of the documentation. That is profoundly wrong. The Government, which came to office in 1997, has a different view of European affairs than the previous rainbow Government led by the former leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton. On its first day in office, the Government committed a cardinal error in terms of constitutional law by attempting to bring together key aspects of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence. That error goes to the heart of the problem this Government has with Europe. For the first time since the mid-1980s we do not have a European affairs Minister and that is a mistake. Deputy Quinn made the point last week that we still do not have full embassies to the accession countries to enhance the bilateral relationship with the Czech Republic and Hungary. That is also a mistake. The Government, at the time this debate was taking place in Nice, stupidly spun the notion, which the Taoiseach used as a kind of macho, eurosceptic argument to put to the people, that he held out to the last minute to ensure taxation matters would not be part of the treaty. Of course, Mr. Blair had also taken the exact same position and it was never really a threat. That kind of spin was not helpful in the debate that was taking place. We have seen just how exposed this Government is in terms of European affairs. We saw it some weeks ago when the Minister for Finance received a reprimand from his colleagues in ECOFIN in relation to budgetary matters. The Government parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, do not have the clout of mainstream political parties like Fine Gael and the Labour Party, who are involved in the European People's Party and the Social Democratic [1154] Party, respectively, and they cannot call on the Ministers and heads of Government of other countries to get them out of trouble. Problems emanate from the fact that the Government does not have collateral built up in other EU states, as a result of its negotiating position, and that is a cause of concern. A balance sheet of our involvement in the European Union would show that all the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Dramatic economic change has resulted from membership of the EU and that is something that we take for granted. We take for granted the fact that, since joining the European Economic Community in 1973, unbelievable growth in employment, economic capacity and opportunity has taken place. By its very definition, Europe must go forward. It began on the basis of an economic ideal and has grown to encompass a security ideal. If the European project is to be realised, there has to be movement forward and further integration. Of course, there has been a pooling of sovereignty and that has had its downside. Some powers are now outside the jurisdiction of this House in order to ensure that the European Union actually works. Those concessions are absolutely essential if we are to proceed to greater integration and freedom in Europe. We have European laws in respect of fundamental rights and many Irish women today have fundamental rights as a result of judgments of the European Court of Justice. We forget that tremendous benefit and such benefits need to be articulated and argued for in this debate. There has been much talk about the decision that larger states will give up their second Commissioner and if there are 27 member countries by the year 2005 we will have to revisit this issue. Some say the Government has given in on a key principle of the Commission whereby, if there is a membership of 27, commissionerships will be rotated. Small countries have rightly felt that having a Commissioner enables them to wield the kind of power that is required and, ultimately, the fact that this principle has been conceded could be to the detriment of this country in the long-term. One of the disappointments of the Nice Treaty is the extension of some 50 provisions whereby qualified majority voting is now required. If one looks at what has been extended, in Article 133(5), unlike the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty, the provisions are minimalist and those who negotiated the treaty have not got the goal of full European integration in mind. I hope those matters will be revisited. As the EU will have perhaps 20 members in five years' time, the European Parliament needs to become much more coherent. It cannot become too unwieldy as a result of the increased membership. Ireland will lose three seats, going from 15 members to 12, and I understand the reasoning behind that. If we are serious about establishing greater democratic control in Europe, the European Parliament has to have much greater controls and political parties need [1155] to put forward clearer plans. It is very difficult in a union of 15 countries, for the programmes of one, two or three political parties to be enforced in the European Parliament and have effect. Until full powers are given to the European Parliament, and Deputy John Bruton has spoken about this in respect of the election of the Commission, the democratic issue cannot be addressed in member states. People need to know that if they elect representatives to the European Parliament they are making decisions which affect their lives. Those elected to the Oireachtas make decisions which affect the lives of the electorate and the issue of the European Parliament having to extend its remit and control must be revisited. Once again, voices outside this House have told lies about the effects of provisions for a common foreign and security policy within the Nice Treaty. I fully support a European Union which not only can defend itself but can impose security in the region and within its borders. It is clear, from a reading of the White Paper, that there is a dumbing down of the Western European Union and that is something I fully understand. When the Maastricht Treaty was being put together, debated and put to the people there was a view that the Western European Union would be the main mechanism for the provision of security within the union. Since the establishment of the Rapid Reaction Force, members of the union will have to take much greater responsibility to provide security within the EU and the implications, in that context, will have to be reconsidered. There are very few changes and the most disappointing part of the treaty is the minimalist change to common foreign and security policy. It is something that future generations will have to revisit. It is nonsense to suggest that the provisions of Article 25, which allow for the newly established political and security committee, are somehow impinging on our neutrality. When one reads the article it is clear that many of the provisions are taken directly from the UN Charter. These are provisions which help the notion of peace, security and the establishment of fundamental rights. They have already been conceded by way of the Petersberg Tasks and will be essential if we want to avoid revisiting the appalling tragedy of Yugoslavia. In effect, it was the Americans, under the aegis of Sfor troops, who led the initial task force to that area, and all European citizens should hold their heads in shame as a result of what took place in Yugoslavia. It is not right and proper for those who are opposing this amendment to the Constitution to suggest that it will mean a diminution of our neutral position or our security it is nothing of the kind. Those of us who are in favour of this referendum and want to see it being passed, have an obligation to demolish the arguments being put forward by those who have been wrong on every [1156] single count since referenda on European Union matters were first held.",12/04/2001,28,302,304,has a different view of European affairs than the previous rainbow Government led by the former leader of my party,Deputy John Bruton,On its first day in office the Government committed a cardinal error in terms of constitutional law by attempting to,Deputy John Bruton,3199292_1,,has a different view of European affairs than the previous rainbow Government led by the former leader of my party Deputy John Bruton On its first day in office the Government committed a cardinal error in terms of constitutional law by attempting to,has a different view of European affairs than the previous rainbow Government led by the former leader of my party On its first day in office the Government committed a cardinal error in terms of constitutional law by attempting to,text31,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,-0.007905694,-0.000197642,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.32032032,0.32032032,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

960002,674,22,154,Adjournment Debate: Government Policy (Resumed).,05/12/1957,Mr. Seán MacEntee,Sinn Féin,Monaghan South,"It is a pity the Deputy did not say 'hear, hear,' in 1945 and 1946 when he was going out bellowing to the people about the hardships they were undergoing then. He knows as well as I do that those hardships were not of our making, but that they were imposed by world circumstances at the time. However, conditions began to improve when materials became available, when it was possible for us to resume the industrial development interrupted by the war in 1939. It was, of course, imperative for us to import new plant and to build up our stocks of raw materials and in many ways to make good the deficiencies which were a consequence of the war. Therefore, in 1947, we had a deficit of £29. 8 million in our balance of payments. It was a relatively small deficit in relation to the resources which were at our disposal. But it was sufficiently large to compel the then Taoiseach, now Deputy Costello, to speak in August of 1948—I think—and refer in rather startling terms to this deficit which had emerged as a result of our external transactions during the year 1947. In consequence of that, there was imposed by the then Government a certain slackening in activity: things were slowed down and the old hidebound, conservative Fine Gael mentality was beginning to prevail. I am not one of those who think we can cure all the nation's ills by spending money we do not have, or are not prepared to save, or which we must borrow and ultimately repay, but there is, I believe, a happy mean between extravagance and demoralising lack of enterprise. However, it was the un-enterprising element that shaped the policy of the Government in 1948 [1616] and continued to shape it during 1949, because the deficit in the balance of payments fell from £29. 8 million to £19. 7 in 1948 and to £9. 7 million pounds in 1949.

He wondered why we are letting them away with this and why they are on the radio every day of the week spinning about how well the economy is going.

One of the main reasons for this is, undoubtedly, the manner in which we organise our affairs, which is dictated by the Government. Most of the parties in Opposition have prepared extensive proposals for Dáil reform. My party submitted an 80-page document on Dáil reform to the Government Chief Whip. Notwithstanding that, however, we are proceeding as before. 6 o'clock There is a time-honoured convention in the House that if a Minister cannot take his or her rota of questions, he or she will seek to change it.

884752,894,9,93,"Medical Practitioners Bill, 1954— Committee Stage.",01/12/1954,Mr. Michael Joseph O'Higgins,Fine Gael,Dublin South-West,"Deputy McGilligan informed me of his views before I came in here. I said I could not agree with him. I said that this is the place to state them and Deputy McGilligan has done that. But, getting down to what is exactly the position, Deputy de Valera, I think following the line of Deputy McGilligan, appears to regard this Bill as a Bill designed to impose controls on the Medical Registration Council whereas in fact it is a Bill designed to remove controls from the Medical Registration Council. At the moment, under Deputy McGilligan's legislation, the Medical Registration Council is fettered down with ministerial controls from the [1339] Department of Finance. Those controls were embodied in the 1927 Act, repeated in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1951. I have proposed to the House a Bill to remove all such ministerial controls from the registration council and to leave them as they are, a vocational body representative of the medical profession, with duties to register and to prescribe registration standards for medical schools. In doing that and in carrying out their functions they should be divorced completely from any Civil Service control. That is done in this Bill. The only thing I have said is: 'Remember that under the law of this country no medical man, no person knowledgeable in medicine or medical matters may practise unless he is registered.' That is unlike Deputy McGilligan's profession and Deputy de Valera's. It is permissible to practise at the Bar without being a member of the Law Library. The call to the Bar, without any registration fees, entitles both Deputy McGilligan and Deputy de Valera to practise. Passing one's final medical examination and getting a degree from the university does not entitle a graduate to practise. In order to practise, he must get on the Irish register, and to get on the register he must pay an appropriate fee. The Minister does not define or state the fee but, as I stated a few minutes ago, in so far as the public interest is affected, and it may be only to a slight degree, it does seem reasonable that the Minister should be asked—should be consulted—with regard to what fees are to be chargeable. I feel that Deputy McGilligan and Deputy de Valera, who have joined together in this matter, are exaggerating about what is in fact a usual provision in relation to every profession which gets a monopoly by the conferring of registration. I cannot think of any other profession where this does not apply. The other professions I have mentioned—the dental profession, the veterinary profession, the pharmaceutical chemists—these are the few that occur to my mind— all these cases the responsible [1340] Minister—the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture—are empowered to approve of the fees being charged for registration. I cannot see what is wrong with it. That is the only element of ministerial control being retained everything else has been removed. Major de Valera: And we have been tending so much in the opposite direction! We have had a long battle on the Local Government Bill, for instance, against the unnecessary intervention of the executive in either individual or collective affairs, and it is for that reason—it is on that principle—that I want to throw in my lot with other people who desire to guard against unnecessary control. I agree the Minister for Health has tended otherwise but I should like to make another comment. We have rather got into the habit of thinking that because something might happen we have to do it. I have heard the case made on the amendment but we seem to forget that we have the power in this House and that the Dáil has the power to deal with anything when it arises as quickly as a controlling Minister. That is something to bear in mind. The Minister has accused us of vague fears—that the psychology behind this is vague fears. Let us rule that out. There is another point which is perhaps a point of instinctive fairness. Why take certain bodies and prescribe for them, and why leave other bodies severely alone? Why should sauce for the goose not also be sauce for the gander? There are certain organisations where it would be in the public interest perhaps to take precautions. Mark the word 'perhaps' it is a very definite qualification, but we are dealing here with the principle of things.

825245,101,8,90,"Committee on Finance. - National Stud Bill, 1953—Money Resolution.",05/03/1953,Mr. Robert Briscoe,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South,"I do not know why there should be so much excitement. Is it permissible for some people to walk on the toes of others and not permissible for those whose toes have been trod upon to do likewise? It is all very well to hit me when I have my hands down and not when they are up. Deputies opposite keep them up [2326] all the time. I approached this problem as a responsible member of the House should. We have an institution which is a business-like institution. Never once in this House in all the years since its establishment has any single action of that institution been questioned or condemned or criticised but when the time comes for a great development to take place which will produce good results for the country as a whole the opportunity is utilised for the purpose of attacking the Government as if the Government were taking £250,000 and throwing it down the drain. I am speaking with a full sense of the responsibility that I should take on here vis-á-vis my constituents. I represent a working class constituency mainly. I am quite satisfied that my constituents would be quite in favour of the line I have taken in this matter. I am not appealing to the lowest motives in people. I am judging the matter in the manner in which we should judge matters connected with national affairs. I believe this is a good move. I hope that whatever purchases the National Stud make will be crowned with success. I hope this sire will prove itself to be a great success and bring credit, prestige and additional funds to our country. There were divided counsels among those who opposed the measure. I wonder why the Leader of the Labour Party has not spoken on this industry. He represents a constituency mainly concerned with this industry but why does he not come in and tell us his view on the matter? Deputy Dunne has several times said that he was speaking on behalf of the Labour Party. I take it that Deputy Norton, as the leader of that Party, is au fait and in accord with that Labour Party decision. I could quite understand a democratic Party making a decision by a majority. It is quite possible that Deputy Norton may not have been in agreement with it, but democratically he must abide by the majority rule.

1937406,569,9,91,"Ombudsman (No. 2) Bill, 1979: Committee Stage (Resumed).",28/05/1980,Professor John M. Kelly,Fine Gael,Dublin South-Central,"I agree very much with what Deputy O'Brien has just said. I should like to make a few specialised points on this schedule. There are two personages in the State I cannot find anywhere in the Bill either included or excluded. I believe they should be excluded but I do not see them in either of the excluding schedules and I do not think they are implied anywhere else. One is the Attorney General and the other is the Director of Public Prosecutions. I do not think either of these persons should be subject to the ombudsman's scrutiny. The Attorney General is an independent constitutional officer and although not a judicial personage he occupies a position which would not be appropriate for the ombudsman, who is scrutinising administration in a more general sense, to look at. I would not be in favour of the Director of Public Prosecutions being under scrutiny but it would be no harm if it is intended to exempt them to say so in so many words. It may be that he is excluded by implication in some way I have missed or my eye has skimmed past and, if so, no doubt the Minister's advisers will tell me. I cannot see how the DPP fits into the Bill. He is not listed among the persons who are subject to investigation. His vote falls under the Attorney General's vote, which, for Dáil purposes, is looked after by the Department of the Taoiseach and I do not notice any exclusions from the Department of the Taoiseach in the second part of the First Schedule, nor does he appear to be mentioned in the Second Schedule. What is one to make of it? I hope the Minister does not think that it is a frivolous matter because more than once it has happened in my time in public [973] life—I am certain the same thing has happened to Deputies Calleary and O'Brien—that people have complained not about being prosecuted but about other people not being prosecuted. For example, if a road accident occurs and someone belonging to them is injured or killed and no prosecution takes place that can be a subject of very acute grievance, let nobody deceive themselves about it. While it might seem vindictive to somebody who is not involved in a family tragedy to be trying to have somebody else prosecuted, one might feel very differently if a member of one's family were injured or worse, let us say, in a motor accident caused by a driver whom one thought was drunk and who had not been prosecuted for reasons which did not seem adequate to me or to you. The Director of Public Prosecutions has to be a genuinely independent personage. He has to be trusted and he is appointed in a manner rather like that of the ombudsman's appointment. We would not get people of standing very anxious to have the job if they were to have, perhaps, a non-lawyer looking over their shoulder, a man not equipped to make decisions of a strictly legal kind based on an assessment of probabilities in a court of law. Therefore I am not in any way suggesting that he should be included in the ombudsman's scrutiny. But I do think that, in order to circumvent people from imagining that the ombudsman, powerless though he is in a lot of other respects, might be able to check up on the Director of Public Prosecutions' failure to prosecute somebody he should be specifically mentioned here. At least I cannot for the moment see why he is not, any more than is the Attorney General. In regard to the individual exclusions, some are very hard to understand. I see that An Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha is one of the bodies excluded from investigation. That is the formal title of the College of Art here beside us. I had a constituent not very long ago who was very much aggrieved by something [974] which the College of Art had done. I will just explain it very briefly. What they had done was to refuse to award him an honours certificate in drawing. Now he had not passed an honours examination but he had passed an ordinary pass examination at a date when there was no distinction between pass and honours, in 1966, I think. Subsequently this distinction was drawn but it was apparently—or so he said—agreed that the pre-1966 pass qualification was equivalent to a post-1966 honours qualification. However, he was unable to produce documentary proof of this because a certificate had not been issued and was now unissuable because there had been a fire, or student demonstration or destruction of some kind in the College of Art and the authorities were no longer in a position to document for him his achievement before 1966. That was a severe nuisance and a professional handicap to him. I cannot see what is the dimension of public interest or security which should render a thing like that immune from the ombudsman's scrutiny, but there it is—An Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha. I see that the Central Bank are excluded. Suppose I want to take money out of the country to pay for something—I do not mean to speculate against the Irish currency—but suppose I want to take money out of the country to pay a bill, to pay for some necessary import, or to buy myself something abroad—and mind you we are in the Common Market one of the purposes of which is the free movement of capital. That is what it was founded for and that is what we have signed up for. Suppose I want to buy something abroad and suppose someone in the Central Bank thinks my purpose is frivolous—suppose he forms that idea in his mind—that would seem to me to be a highly om-budsworthy matter. But I see the Central Bank is here excluded if they refuse me exchange control permission. What is the reason for excluding that? Previously I acknowledged that Deputy Calleary, the Minister of State, had a degree of modesty and [975] reasonableness quite unusual in his party when he admitted that we were only feeling our way in this Bill that we would have to learn as we went along and that the last word had not been said. Something like that coming from a Minister is very disarming. But my experience also tells me that once a thing like this becomes an Act it is very hard to get much of a shift out of it afterwards. I do urge the Minister of State that there are what I can only call idle inclusions in this long list in the Second Schedule. There are bodies included in it that there is no good public reason for excluding. Why not look at it in this way? Why not put them into the ones which are subject to scrutiny and take up the same line that we are only feeling our way, that we will see how we get on and, if the Central Bank or the College of Art find themselves the target of an insupportable burden of inquiry and scrutiny, that they cannot conduct their business without finding little ombudspeople under their feet, certainly then let us look at it again and perhaps remove them from scrutiny in some way. This is a body of men who have done the State an enormous amount of service, but it is a typical, official attitude—let us cover up all we can, wait for the others to squeal and, if they squeal hard enough, we may let out an inch or two here or there, but let us cover up as much as we can in the first instance. That is not a good footing on which to get an ombudsman off the ground. I see that the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is included. Perhaps I have had a slip of memory here but, as far as I can remember, that is the body which carries out the blood tests on samples taken from motorists. That is a function which, if something goes wrong with it, may be responsible for somebody unjustly being very heavily penalised. It is true that that cannot happen except through a court proceeding, in the course of which the motorist concerned will have ample opportunity to test the correctness of the certificate of his blood. I do not make [976] any special point about this, but what is the sense in excluding the operations of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety from the scrutiny of the ombudsman? Probably it would happen once in ten years only that anyone would start worrying about what was going on in that medical bureau but why exclude it? Why not let the ombudsman in? If he makes a damn nuisance of himself, unreasonably so, and the bureau cannot get on with its work, then perhaps think about taking him out again. But the worst aspect of the exclusions in the Second Schedule are the ones to which Deputy O'Brien adverted a moment ago. I have been in this House since 1969 when I first stood for the Dáil. I am not exactly sure how long Deputy Calleary has been here I suppose somewhat longer because I think he was a member of a local authority before he ever came to Leinster House. He knows perfectly well that the bread and butter of the political clinic are people who want health cards, people who want houses, and now, of course, people who want telephones. At least that is how it is in the Dublin suburbs. I can quite understand that in the country there may be an additional range of things. Now and again one gets an eccentric constituent—I do not say that in a censorious way—a constituent with an exotic or out-of-the-way problem. I had one once who was in a terrible state because CIE would not sell him an old double decker he wanted for his private bus collection. I have to say I notched it up amongst one of my successes—I managed to persuade CIE to sell him that old double decker bus. Their reasons for being unwilling to do so were very respectable. They said that, in their experience, even though these double decker buses started off as collectors' items they ended up as unsightly chicken coops. places for growing mushrooms in and generally as eye sores. I persuaded them that the man in question was above board. I showed them photographs of an astounding collection of buses he had made and, eventually, much to their credit, they changed their mind and sold him the old [977] bus. But for every interesting case one gets like that—and out of which one might get some personal benefit from following to its end—one gets 50 which are run of the mill cases about health cards, housing allocations and telephones. What am I to say now to some constituents who come along to me wanting to know if they can get some benefit from the Eastern Health Board? What am I to say in Dundrum and Rathfarnham to people who feel they need contributions to their medicines? What am I to say to the far more numerous ones who cannot get a house? These operations of dispensing health benefits and housing allocations are the functions of the health boards and local authorities respectively. These matters are, however, excepted and exempted from the scrutiny of the ombudsman. It is not a bit of use to tell Mrs. So-and-So who comes to my clinic in Dundrum that if she has a quarrel with the Public Records Office, with the State Paper Office or with the National Museum the ombudsman will look into her case. That is no use to her. She wants a house for her husband and three children. And when she says: 'I thought we now had an ombudsman in this country who would look into my grievance', a grievance sharpened by the perception that a neighbour of hers who has less points as far as she can see—though she is usually wrong there may be some medical dimension or other matter of which she is not aware—has got a house, or somebody who has been on the list for a shorter time, she feels a very acute sense of grievance. She could live to be a very old woman and never once fall out with the Public Record Office, or with the State Paper Office or the National Museum. But she feels a bitter sense of grievance if she has to live in a house with 14 other people. I will not mention the roads concerned but the Minister of State can very well imagine this for himself. This is the sense of grievance which makes up 95 cases out of 100 of the [978] grievances which people feel against administration, none of which, or a diminishing fraction of which only are the result of official malice. Most of them are not even the result of official negligence but of the grand old budgetary constraints which do not allow enough money for this, that or the other, and the people at the bottom of the barrel are squeezed as they always are. That is a grievance, and an ombudsman who cannot do anything about it will not be of any use to me or to Deputy Calleary. The same goes for the VECs, perhaps to a lesser degree. What about people who apply for appointments controlled by these committees? They may feel a sense of grievance but they will be wasting their breath if they go to a local representative to ask him to take the matter up with the ombudsman. They will say they are frightfully sorry but that they cannot do anything about it because the letter of the law will exclude it. However, if it should happen that a person has a problem with the Ordnance Survey, the local representative can say: 'I will certainly take that up. I will march to the Phoenix Park and bang the table, but as far as getting you a job with the VEC is concerned, or a house or a health card, you will have to go to your TD'. That is the size of it. Though I do not want to belittle the task any Government have in trying to make everybody happy, I say the Fine Gael Bill was infinitely superior to this, and I hope that the Minister, whom I genuinely and sincerely praise for the humility and moderation with which he dealt with this Bill, will try to bring some more of it to bear to get the Bill substantially changed between now and the Report Stage.",28/05/1980,21,1546,1547,been in this House since 1969 when I first stood for the Dáil I am not exactly sure how long,Deputy Calleary,has been here I suppose somewhat longer because I think he was a member of a local authority before he,Deputy Calleary,1937406_2,,been in this House since 1969 when I first stood for the Dáil I am not exactly sure how long Deputy Calleary has been here I suppose somewhat longer because I think he was a member of a local authority before he,been in this House since 1969 when I first stood for the Dáil I am not exactly sure how long has been here I suppose somewhat longer because I think he was a member of a local authority before he,text395,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.079056942,0.001976424,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.526526527,0.508508509,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
828121,751,2,157,Committee on Finance. - Motion by the Minister for Finance (Resumed).,19/03/1953,Mr. John (Jack) McQuillan,Clann na Poblachta,Roscommon,"There are opponents to the use of turf. Some of its greatest opponents are the engineers and we have to fight against the technical advice of men placed in positions where they can do damage to the development of our own native resources on our bogs. I have met engineers who have told me they do not regard turf as the correct means of heating such and such a place, or that they do not think turf is as satisfactory as coal. Let us depend for a change on the advice of the type of engineer who is anxious to see our fuel resources fully developed. We have to fight, too, against the type of opponent who tells us that we have only a limited quantity of turf and that if we continue to develop the bogs they will be cut out in 20 or 30 [719] years' time. I welcome the day when the bogs will be cut out. From the moment at which we embark on large-scale development of our peat resources we should start an intensive reafforestation programme everywhere turf has been cut. Thirty years hence there will be good fuel available there in the form of quick-growing timber to provide yet another source of native fuel in the years ahead. Let us, therefore, not worry at all about cutting out the bogs. I will be very brief in dealing with agriculture. In spite of what Deputy Dillon and others like him may say in this House I believe that agriculture is stagnant to-day. Little or no work has been done for the last 30 years with regard to production. Again I must agree with Deputy Giles that agriculture has been to a great extent bedevilled by political Parties, not all Parties. I hope I will not be taken as criticising individuals or the Parties too much in this regard, but I feel there has been no continuity in the programme pursued for agricultural development due to the fact that you have changes of Government every three or four years. What you want in regard to agriculture is a policy of continuity and security so that a farmer can look forward for years ahead and say to himself: 'It does not matter to me if the Government changed ten times over in the next five years. This policy will be pursued and I will receive suitable recompense for my labours.' I am not a farmer but I think I am entitled to speak in spite of the type of individual like Deputy Donnellan who states in this House that nobody but a farmer should speak here on agriculture. I say: goodness help this country if we have to depend on the like of Deputy Donnellan to solve the problems that face us. One of the main things necessary if we want to increase production is to give a guaranteed price to the producer. There are men in my constituency whose land is not good enough for the growing of wheat but whose land is excellent for the growing of barley, malting and feeding. The acreage for malting barley has been reduced [720] and there is no guaranteed price for the feeding barley which these men produce. One of the most essential things for a farmer is a guaranteed price and a guarantee that the foreign foodstuffs will not be allowed in. Our motto in this regard should be: not an ounce from abroad of what we can produce at home. There is no question of compulsion in this matter but there is a question of zoning. We have areas that are ideally suited for certain types of crops. Let us utilise those areas for such crops but give a guaranteed price to the producers. We have a system in operation to-day whereby the maltsters give a guaranteed price in certain areas for the production of barley. Why cannot the State give a guaranteed price in other areas for the production of feeding barley? Other areas have proved themselves ideal for the production of potatoes and oats. Why should not those farmers whose tradition it has been for generations to produce oats get a guaranteed price? As Deputy Dr. Esmonde suggested, why should not storage accommodation be made available if there is a surplus produced? These are some ways in which we can increase output on the land but until we give a guaranteed price to the farmer for his products, all the talk in this House is pure hot air. The farmer has plenty of sense and if he asks me, as a public representative: 'What price will I get for the coming year for the production of feeding barley?' and I tell him I do not know, that man feels that he should not grow that crop this year. Tied up with agriculture we have the Land Commission and I will restrain myself with regard to what I have to say about that particular body. I have spoken time and again here about the sins of the Land Commission and I am sure some of them will fall on my own soul because of all I have said about them. I am in thorough agreement with Deputy Dr. Browne in regard to what he said last night about the small congested holders. We had the Land League started in this country and men like Michael Davitt and others were willing to suffer the greatest torture in [721] order to give security and justice to the farming community, but I do not believe for one moment that the aims of those men were to see the small farmers living in slums as they are to-day. The extraordinary situation has developed that if you suggest that the small farmer or the congest be removed from the locality, you are a traitor or a Communist you are not fit to be allowed into this House. If we have slums in the cities, the State has power to raze those slums to the ground and provide good housing instead. If we have rural slums the State should have power to remove them. I represent a constituency in which there are rural slums as bad as any in Mayo or in County Galway, and I feel that the power should be there to wipe them out. Instead of that we have entire areas which, as I mentioned in this House before, require demolition. In one area alone there are 348 holdings under £5 valuation. What solution is there for the like of that? Is there any hope for the young people born into those houses of getting a living out of the land? Is it not time we stopped 'kidding' the Irish people and the small farmer by giving doles, and so forth, as a means of eking out an existence, not a livelihood? We hear every day from the Land Commission that there is land available to relieve congestion. It is very hard for the land to be made available to relieve congestion when we have, in the words of Commissioner Mansfield himself, in a few years 100,000 acres of the finest land of Ireland passing into the hands of the aliens in the midlands. There is not a day we have not a sale of a new farm in Kildare, Meath or Westmeath which is bought by Colonel So-and-so and Major So-and-so, while, as I have often said, the natives must go to work for these people who come over here to buy big holdings. I maintain that while there is a farm of land available for the foreigner to purchase there is land available for the Land Commission to relieve congestion. We must be ruthless in these things and if necessary, in regard to the Land Commission, those men who [722] are at the top of the Department of Lands must be retired. Give them a good pension God speed them and put in others that will do the work. In relation to afforestation we have had a lot of squeaking from Deputy Blowick about what he did for afforestation. I do not want to be too hard on Deputy Blowick. I feel that he is sincere about it, believe it or not. However, I am afraid the Deputy did not know the Department of Forestry from the Department of Lands. The only way he would know one from the other would be if there were different numbers on the doors. Perhaps he was sincere but if we are going to tackle the question of afforestation in the manner in which it should be approached, then the puny efforts of Deputy Blowick appear to me to be completely pathetic in connection with this vast scheme of development. I am trying to be fair to Deputy Blowick.",19/03/1953,14,240,241,at all about cutting out the bogs I will be very brief in dealing with agriculture In spite of what,Deputy Dillon,and others like him may say in this House I believe that agriculture is stagnant to-day Little or no work,Deputy Dillon,828121_1,,at all about cutting out the bogs I will be very brief in dealing with agriculture In spite of what Deputy Dillon and others like him may say in this House I believe that agriculture is stagnant to-day Little or no work,at all about cutting out the bogs I will be very brief in dealing with agriculture In spite of what and others like him may say in this House I believe that agriculture is stagnant to-day Little or no work,text607,3,1,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-0.84729786,-0.021182447,-0.085895569,-0.002147389,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.153153153,0.163163163,0.221221221,0.235235235,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

725990,623,3,42,Committee on Finance. - Vote 27 — Agriculture (Resumed),22/06/1950,Mr. Patrick Desmond Lehane,Clann na Talmhúain,Cork South,"I asked the Minister on a number of occasions about the price of pigs and the Minister prognosticated a price of 190/-. I came into the House here afterwards with thousands of pig dockets which I offered to the Minister showing that the price of 190/- was not being paid. I came again and I asked the Minister was he aware of that and he told me that he was not, that in Limerick there were three factories paying a price of 190/- and 192/-. I came with another question and I asked him if he would tell us where they advertised these prices. I raised the matter on the adjournment and I could get no information until I tabled another question. I found then that these prices were then being advertised by being stuck on the backdoor of a couple of factories in Limerick. At the same time I had thousands of dockets in this House which I offered to the Minister on several occasions showing that certain factories were paying only 170/-, while the Minister said that they should pay 190/- and that they should be able to sell bacon at a certain price. Since then the price of bacon has advanced considerably. I think it is very important now that the Minister should give us this inquiry. Every time the price of pigs is put up 4/- a cwt. the price of bacon soars 2d. a lb. One need not be a mathematician to know that it is quite unreasonable to have such an increase in the price of bacon for an increase of 4/- per cwt. in the price of pigs. I would again appeal to the Minister to give us this committee of inquiry to inquire into the whole question of the pigs and bacon industry. I warned the Minister at that time that if the racketeering that was going on was continued, there would be a shortage of pigs and there will be a shortage of pigs. It will be further aggravated by the increases in price of feeding stuffs and the lack of feeding stuffs due to devaluation and the failure of the crops in certain countries. When I was speaking on this matter about two years ago, I suggested to the Minister again that he should be a [2241] little bit cautious in extending the egg industry unless he got a long-term agreement so far as the price of eggs is concerned. Now we are faced with the position that the price of eggs is decreasing while the price of feeding stuffs on which hens will have to be fed is increasing and it is getting scarce. I think that if we supply a commodity to Britain and Britain is at the same time supplying commodities to us, we should at least get some sort of reasonable agreement. When we want coal from Britain she exports it to us at 25/- per ton more than she sells it to consumers in England but, on the other hand, she wants commodities from us at a lesser price than we must charge our home consumers if we are going to give a decent standard of living to agricultural producers in this country. I do not agree with the Minister in blaming Deputy Davern and Deputy Blaney about the shortage of potatoes and oats. I think the Minister has a certain responsibility in that regard. himself. The Minister made a public announcement when the oat crop was just about to go into the market to the effect that huge quantities of maize at a very cheap price would be available almost immediately. These huge quantities of maize did not become available until a considerable time after the date mentioned by the Minister and they did not become available at the price suggested when the oat market was opening. We all know, and the Minister knows, that the percentage of the oat crop that is cashed is very small and if the Minister had held back that speech for a month or two months, he would have been in plenty of time to give notice about the cheap maize and the small percentage of the oat crop that goes on the market would have gone on the market and would have obtained a reasonably fair price and everybody would have been satisfied. Actually, what happened was that all the stuff was dumped on the market and afterwards people were wanting to buy it back when the cheap maize that was promised did not come. So far as potatoes are concerned. I think the Minister has a certain [2242] responsibility also. He established a marketing board and on that board he gave a very inadequate, if any, representation to producers. It was a board composed of factors and middlemen, and these middlemen gave the farmers half the price they were promised for their potatoes. They gave them £5 odd when the price f. o.b. was £10 13s. In addition to that, they made the unfortunate farmers coming into them put the potatoes through a measuring machine and they discarded considerable quantities of potatoes which should not have been discarded in my opinion. In many cases fellows came in with two tons of potatoes. They got £5 for the ton which was taken from them and they were told to take home the other ton. I may say that they were very glad afterwards that they did so. I do not think the Minister is being quite fair in putting all the blame for this matter on the shoulders of Deputy Blaney and Deputy Davern. Certain representations have been made to the Minister by the cow-testing supervisors in the country. They are a body of men who are nobody's children. The Department, principally, pay their salaries but they say that they do not employ them. The cow-testing associations who, I suppose, nominally employ these men on the instructions of the Department — when they have passed examinations laid down by the Department and when their appointment is sanctioned by the Department — say that they are Department officials. These people have been looking for some time past for some sort of decent remuneration. They have made several pleas to the Minister. The Minister may not agree with the present system of cow testing. I am inclined to have a great deal of sympathy with the Minister in that point of view. However, as long as these people are there and in employment they are entitled to a decent wage. The Minister should do something in the matter. Either he should make up his mind that he does not want cow-testing supervisors and tell them that or else he should not keep them on the long finger and say that something will be done when something else happens that when the co-operative creameries [2243] or the Dairy Disposal Board do this the Department will make up its mind in regard to what it believes and thinks about cow-testing associations. If the Department believes that there is no use in continuing cow testing and that the future policy will be to breed off proven bulls, let the Minister tell us so. Let him say: 'We do not want the registered cow, the premium bull and the earmarked calf, the progeny of these.' Let the Minister tell us that and tell these fellows to try and get some other job or let him try and work them in as inspectors under the water scheme or the land reclamation scheme. I want to say, in this connection, that I am criticising not only the Minister but also his two predecessors in office. These cow-testing supervisors went to Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Agriculture they went to Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture, and they have now gone to the present Minister. Their experience with the three Ministers is that they were put on the long finger. It is about time something was done or that they were told to get out or told that there was no future or at least told the policy of the Department as regards cow testing. We heard a great deal from Deputy Smith, Deputy Corry and other Deputies on the subject of milk. A costings survey which was carried out by University College, Cork, was misquoted in this House and elsewhere by both Deputy Corry and the Minister. The Minister said he himself had no authority to quote these figures and he said yesterday that he got permission from Deputy Corry to quote them in future. While I agree that the Minister did not quote them, the Minister misquoted them on a number of occasions — notably at Charleville when he was opening a cheese factory there. These costings were carried out some years ago. If you want to relate these costings to present-day conditions you must scale them up to meet the increased charges that have occurred since they were made. Everybody knows that in a dairy herd there is a considerable labour content. The labour rate in 1946 was a good deal less [2244] than it is in 1950. That is one item that will have to be scaled up. The particular herds that were costed in that year were fed with a good deal of imported feeding stuffs. That matter also will have to be scaled up. Even if the 1946 costings had been truly and accurately quoted, I would point out that they do not give any guide to conditions as they exist to-day unless they are scaled up intelligently and scientifically. I do not know what to think about the Livestock Breeding Act. My attitude all along has been that if we have dairying districts we should have dairy cattle in them. The Minister announced that a price of 1/- a gallon would be available for milk for the next five years and that that would bring about the greatest era of prosperity that this country has ever experienced — and that, if the farmers and the co-operative societies did not accept that scheme, such a glorious offer would never come before them again. The co-operative societies and the farmers did not accept the scheme, as far as I know. I wonder, having regard to the Minister's words, if that means that the future of the dairying industry is bleak and dreary. If we have lost this golden opportunity, which will never occur again, of getting 1/- a gallon for our milk, I wonder if, on that basis, we are wise at all in producing dairy stock? If we have lost that golden opportunity, might it not be a more sensible policy in the long run — even if in the dairying counties we were to have the Whiteheads, the Herefords—to go in for dry stock? We would not then have any problem of surplus milk and we would have no bleak future to face. It is a matter which the Minister and the Department should consider very carefully. If we have lost that golden opportunity of 1/- a gallon for milk and if we shall never have such a golden opportunity again, and if, at the same time, there is a guaranteed market for live stock in Britain, I wonder if it would not be wise for us to put all our money in that basket? I do not think it would be, but the matter is one which the Department of Agriculture and the Minister should consider very carefully [2245]—especially if the dire threats of the Minister mean anything. The Minister, it would appear, has lost interest in flax. The best flax in the country can be grown in many parts of County Cork. Instead of having to go to Belfast and appeal to the Belfast spinners to take his flax, the Minister should see that a spinning factory is established in the Twenty-Six Counties. I suggest to him that in West Cork and South Cork we would grow enough flax to keep a spinning-wheel going if it were established in such a place as Bandon, that would tap all the south and west Cork areas where we can grow far better flax than can be grown in the Six Counties at the moment. This is important for a number of reasons. Linen or flax products are substantial dollar earners. At the moment we take our flax and scutch it in Cork in a number of scutching mills and send it across the Border to the spinning mills. It is afterwards exported to America and other areas and the dollars that come from it accrue to the Six Counties rather than to this country. The Minister should seriously consider that suggestion. He will not have to withdraw from the attitude he adopted. He can still be offended as he likes with the Northern spinners. He will deal with them much more effectively by establishing south of the Border a flax-spinning industry that will produce a commodity that will bring a number of dollars to this country and which will be helpful to the general State economy. These are the few points I want to mention. I hope the Minister will have some little consideration for them. I move around the country and I meet more farmers than the Minister, because of his office, has time to do and, because of the Minister's elevated office, he probably does not hear the truth so much as I do. I hear views that are not always complimentary either about myself or the Minister. The point I am trying to make is that the Minister would not have the same facility for getting the opinions and feelings of the people as I have. I am offering these suggestions to him for consideration and I hope that when we speak on the Estimate for Agriculture next year some of the criticisms that I [2246] have offered will have received serious consideration by the Department.",22/06/1950,13,1296,1297,predecessors in office These cow-testing supervisors went to Deputy Dr Ryan when he was Minister for Agriculture they went to,Deputy Smith,when he was Minister for Agriculture and they have now gone to the present Minister Their experience with the three,Deputy Smith,725990_3,,predecessors in office These cow-testing supervisors went to Deputy Dr Ryan when he was Minister for Agriculture they went to Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture and they have now gone to the present Minister Their experience with the three,predecessors in office These cow-testing supervisors went to Deputy Dr Ryan when he was Minister for Agriculture they went to when he was Minister for Agriculture and they have now gone to the present Minister Their experience with the three,text675,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.03904344,0.000976086,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.468468468,0.461461461,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1541297,891,3,143,Committee on Finance. - Financial Resolution No. 3: General (Resumed).,16/05/1972,Mr. Thomas O'Hara,Clann na Talmhúain,Mayo North,"I should like to thank Deputy Briscoe for his reference to the west, brief though it was, and his suggestion that the west and [1850] its problems should be remembered. He mentioned a major link road as one thing that would be of benefit to that region. I agree with that but apart from this, there are many other things with some of which I propose to deal in my remarks this evening. It is so rare to hear any Dublin Deputy refer to the west or western problems that I felt it a duty to thank him for mentioning it and I assure him that I and those I represent appreciate it. When the budget was framed the Minister probably was not quite sure where he stood in regard to the referendum, whether the Irish people would vote 'Yes' or 'No'. It seems to some that he took a certain gamble by budgeting for a deficit but I would not regard it as a gamble. Neither did Deputy O'Higgins who spoke after the Minister nor the Labour Party leader, Deputy Corish. One can afford to take certain risks at certain times and this was an occasion when the Minister was quite right in taking the steps he took and budgeting for a deficit. He was well aware that if he ran into problems he could come back to the House, perhaps in October or November, with new proposals to help him out of his difficulties. In the circumstances when we look back on the referendum result it seems that the Minister has not taken anything like a serious risk. I share the optimism of Deputy Briscoe— perhaps not to the same extent—when he says there is a bright future for the country. I am convinced that is so provided we put our house in order. I also share his view that this was the greatest thing that ever happened to this country. I have lived through a period in which I personally experienced the difficulties and problems that confronted our people when they were totally dependent on the British market for the sale of their produce, particularly agricultural produce. Down through the years our farmers have had the experience of being advised and encouraged not only by successive governments but by everybody with any influence such as committees of agriculture, to increase production [1851] in various lines, poultry and pigs, lowland and mountain sheep and so on. They were advised to improve the quality of their cattle. When they did, time and again the farmers were faced with having to sell their produce, after all their labour and investment and the work of themselves and their families, below economic level. This went on year in year out. They might enjoy a boom for two or three years but this had the effect of leading them up the garden, rushing into producing a surplus of something such as cattle or sheep or pigs or turkeys only to find the market depressed and the produce almost unsaleable or saleable only at give-a-way prices. The British market was a very doubtful one. Although quite near us and involving minimum shipping, we still found ourselves in the position that because the British believed in a cheap food policy, they were able to buy from Australia, New Zealand, Denmark and elsewhere, very heavy surpluses at certain times with the deliberate purpose of depressing the prices of our products. This has happened time and time again with very serious consequences to farming and to those dependent on it and also to the economy of the country. A new deal will now be arranged. We know the terms of the Treaty of Rome. We are assured of a bright future provided we are prepared to work harder. Our people will be prepared to do so once they know that their efforts will be rewarded. I was engaged in the referendum campaign in my own neighbourhood. I spoke to many people and explained the facts to them. Many of these people were former customers of mine who supplied me with different items of farm produce. They realise my position as a businessman and their own position as producers. They are aware that what I said was true. I spoke at chapel gates and other centres from where I could see closed homes and schools. The churches were half empty. All these things were the sad and positive proof that a blight had struck. It is no pleasure [1852] to me to relate these facts, but they are true. I was curious to know how the polling went in the different regions on polling day. There are considerable acreages of good farm land in County Mayo, which is a big county. There is some good quality land in the Claremorris area, and around Castlebar, Straide, Killala and Ballycastle. There are also mountainous regions. In the mountainous regions where people are in receipt of unemployment benefit or 'dole'——",16/05/1972,19,6,7,I should like to thank,Deputy Briscoe,for his reference to the west brief though it was and his suggestion that the west and 1850 its problems,Deputy Briscoe,1541297_1,,I should like to thank Deputy Briscoe for his reference to the west brief though it was and his suggestion that the west and 1850 its problems,I should like to thank for his reference to the west brief though it was and his suggestion that the west and 1850 its problems,text172,1,2,0,0,25,0.04,1,0.510825624,0.020433025,0.102062073,0.004082483,0.738738739,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.636636637,0.592592593,0.662662663,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3671493,901,9,45,Private Members&rsquo Business - Drug Abuse: Motion.,23/05/2006,Mr. Jim O'Keeffe,Fine Gael,Cork South-West,"Clearly the Government is sleepwalking its way through a drugs epidemic. Cocaine is the example that is currently mentioned. Its use has become increasingly widespread. A reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Stagg indicated that the figures have increased each year. In 2001, 5. 3 kg was seized by the Garda with a value of €371,000 in 2002, 31 kg was seized with a value of €2. 2 million in 2003, 107 kg was seized with a value of €7. 5 million in 2004, 167 kg was seized with a value of €11 million and in 2005, 242 kg was seized with a value of €16 million. The Government seems to be helpless in addressing the problem of this very addictive drug which now apparently affects 3% of the population. Another drug, methamphetamine, is regarded as potentially even more dangerous than heroin. However, no extra resources have been committed to the Garda Síochána to deal with that problem. As Deputy English mentioned heroin addicts who wish to enter a rehabilitation programme must wait up to 19 months before being admitted to a methadone clinic. The Government promised the resources to deal with the problem. Above all we are experiencing the consequences of the Government not providing the Garda with the additional resources that were clearly promised before the last general election and in the programme for Government. We do not have the additional gardaí and the strength of the force is still less than 12,000. It does not have the equipment it was promised and the Government is solely responsible for the consequences of not providing those resources. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has talked big about drugs in prisons and acted very small. Under the regime of that Minister, prisons have become breeding grounds for new drug users. One of the most alarming aspects is the prevalence of drugs in prisons. The Minister has made great claims that he had addressed the issue and yet the problem of drug supply has increased each year since he became Minister. Instead of eliminating drugs from prisons, they have become crime universities. Studies have shown that between 19% and 21% of users of intravenous drugs began injecting heroin in prison. The programme for Government — the foolish document that was launched some years ago — promised a plan to completely end all heroin use in prisons by the end of 2002 in tandem with compulsory drug testing. Needless to say neither goal has been realised, which is to be expected from the Government in light of its performance, or lack of it, in so many areas at this stage. Talk about minimum mandatory sentences will not solve the problem. We have ended up with courts imposing sentences that are neither minimum nor mandatory. Talking about minimum sentences will not frighten the crooks. They know perfectly well that these sentences the Minister and his colleagues talk about are neither minimum nor mandatory. Ultimately these people go [85]to jail. The day they enter jail, they receive 25% remission when they sign in. Has the Minister ever considered not giving them remission until they earn it through good behaviour, participation in rehabilitation programmes and ensuring they do not become involved in drug use? Such fresh thinking is needed but it will not be provided by the Government.

4141982,2203,8,218,Macroeconomic and Fiscal Outlook: Statements,27/10/2010,Mr. Thomas Byrne,Fianna Fáil,Meath East,"This debate is being watched by members of the public who want answers. They want us to seek consensus and show generosity to the Opposition. I believe the Government has shown such generosity in listening to ideas from the Opposition and providing its spokespersons with figures and information. I note with interest the welcome statement by the Minister for Finance that the Opposition will be given access to any figures or information it requires. The Government side does not have a monopoly on wisdom. Some of the ideas presented by the Opposition must be taken into account. A job of work remains to be done to convince people of the scale of the challenge facing us. This applies equally to parliamentarians and public representatives. Have we asked ourselves what €15 billion in savings will mean over four years? Will we all be shocked by the extent of the four-year plan that is vital for economic recovery? It is difficult to imagine €15 billion in cuts and tax increases. The most important part of the four-year programme is economic growth. Cutting expenditure and taking a creative approach to the tax system present opportunities to secure economic growth. Without wishing to take a Thatcherite view, I believe the private sector would do better in some areas in which the State is involved. In doing so, it could contribute to economic growth and reduce costs to the State. As the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, stated when he visited Kells in my constituency, we must protect the poor, the weak and the most vulnerable and examine in a creative manner those areas in which the private sector could do a better job than the State. We must focus specifically on areas of current expenditure in which the Government should not be involved. If the private sector could become involved in these areas, it would generate economic growth while reducing costs to taxpayers. There is no doubt that we face massive problems in terms of our budgetary strategy for the coming years. The announcement of €15 billion in savings was shocking. I do not have any desire to make cuts for the sake of it. We must, with determination and without any doubt in our hearts, meet head on the challenge of bridging the gap of €15 billion over the next four years. To do otherwise would be to derail the hopes, dreams and aspirations of future generations. We must treat the challenge facing us as an opportunity to get our house in order. We have to ensure we balance our books and avoid national bankruptcy. The prize at the end of the process will be to restore hope and confidence to citizens. While the task ahead is a cause of worry and concern, people should be conscious of the ultimate goal which, as the Minister stated, is the maintenance and improvement of our living standards. Failure to reduce our deficit would undermine confidence in Ireland’s ability to meet its obligations and responsibilities and delay a return to growth. It is vital that we do not delay because to do so would stall growth. On the other hand, getting our financial house in order will facilitate economic and employment growth. [101]We have choices to make. We can increase the tax burden on those who are working or we can cut expenditure. While neither option is palatable, the gap must be bridged. The Fianna Faíl Party, the Green Party, Independent Deputies, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have given a commitment to the European Commission and other European countries that the deficit will be reduced to 3%. This figure must remain our target and cuts in expenditure must be the main mechanism by which we achieve it, although there is scope for tax increases. I concur with the Labour Party’s proposal to introduce a higher rate of income tax of 48%. The problem, however, is that such a measure would close the gap by only 3%, leaving a balance of 97%. While the proposed initiative would grab headlines, the Government would still have 97% of the work to do to achieve the €15 billion target. Calls to tax the rich may sound great but the Labour Party’s proposal would only solve 3% of the problem over four years. The party must accept that the problem is much broader than simply taxing the rich. If we had more rich people, perhaps we would not face such severe problems. The Labour Party also points out that tax reliefs amount to €11 billion. However, tax credits or tax free allowances as they were known account for most of this figure. These reliefs are not shelters for hotels or property development but part of the tax code for ordinary people. We should work together constructively to address the problem before us. The Government has taken a constructive approach and I welcome the fact that the Opposition is becoming more constructive by the day.",27/10/2010,30,581,582,expenditure While neither option is palatable the gap must be bridged The Fianna Faíl Party the Green Party Independent Deputies,Fine Gael,and the Labour Party have given a commitment to the European Commission and other European countries that the deficit will,Fine Gael,4141982_5,,expenditure While neither option is palatable the gap must be bridged The Fianna Faíl Party the Green Party Independent Deputies Fine Gael and the Labour Party have given a commitment to the European Commission and other European countries that the deficit will,expenditure While neither option is palatable the gap must be bridged The Fianna Faíl Party the Green Party Independent Deputies and the Labour Party have given a commitment to the European Commission and other European countries that the deficit will,text255,1,2,0,0,40,0.025,1,0.510825624,0.012770641,-0.148365074,-0.003709127,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.597597598,0.592592593,0.165165165,0.193193193,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
829514,788,22,63,"Committee on Finance. - Health Bill, 1952—Money Resolution.",15/04/1953,General Richard Mulcahy,Sinn Féin,Dublin (Clontarf),"I would like to give the Minister a chance of correcting some misconceptions on my part. The Minister has, on many occasions, told us that when he came to deal with the Second Reading he would discuss the costs of this measure. Beyond telling us that it would cost £1,800,000 when operating in full and that half of that would be paid by the State and half by the local authorities, he gave us no information of any kind in regard to the costs. He suggested that he would be glad to do it only that he would have to disclose what he has in mind for certain services which will be subject to negotiation by persons and bodies concerned. We are presented now with this measure. We are presented with it in spite of the fact that the profession whose work and services he proposes to arrange have declared that they have not been adequately consulted in the matter, that they are not going to co-operate if the measure is passed and that they have given reasons both general and particular for their attitude. In face of that the Minister comes to the House with a complicated measure which will have very definite and important reactions not only on the lives of the people but also on their character and general well-being. It will also have an impact on the organisation of our institutions here. He merely tells us it is going to cost £1,800,000. The Minister has seen many estimates as to what the cost of this measure is likely to be but he has made [76] no attempt to challenge the cost of these things. His reply to Deputy Costello's speech on the matter is just a little bit of political ranting which comes rather peculiarly when he stresses the urgency of the matters. When the Minister talks about the urgency, it comes rather peculiarly from him since he emphasised in dealing with the matter here that some time must elapse before the proposals in the Bill, if the Bill is passed, will be put into operation and that it is not his intention to push local authorities unduly to implement the provision of the Bill. On this Financial Resolution, I think the Minister should address himself to these costs. The White Paper which the Minister says is not very much changed in the terms of the Bill gives on page 12, paragraph 19, certain headings as follows:— 'The Government proposes that the following new or extended services should be provided:— (a) Hospital and specialist services.' Has any estimate been made of what will be the cost of the new and extended services under the heading of hospital and specialist services in a year, two years' or three years' time when the scheme is in full operation? In regard to the heading under (b) has any estimate been made as to what the additional cost will be for the medical care for mothers and infants? Has any estimate been made as to what the additional cost will be under (c) maternity cash grants, under (d) child welfare service, (e) school medical service, (f) nursing service, (g) dental and ophthalmic services and (h) medicines and nutrients? We are dealing with a measure radically reorganising the health services of the country and we are doing that at a time when the people who will carry it out say they cannot co-operate in view of the nature of the proposals and the lack of discussion and consideration as between them and the Minister. Surely this House is entitled to know whether any detailed consideration has been given to the additional cost that will arise under these headings. The Minister, or at any rate his Department, [77] must have examined in rather considerable detail how these additional and extended services are going to be organised and applied. Some estimate, however round the figure may be, must have been made. To get away with the excuse that he cannot give us any information about these matters because he would have to disclose what he has in his mind for certain services which would be subject to negotiations with the persons and bodies concerned, is trifling completely with the Dáil which is asked to deal with a very important matter affecting the lives of our people generally. I would like to say, in view of the position that has arisen between the Department and the doctors—whoever is responsible—that, if pressed on this House, it is going to put this House in a very difficult position, because if the position is that the Minister is being unjust, and is blindly going ahead in a brutal and dictatorial way with his scheme, and is riding rough-shod over one of the primary peices of functional and professional organisation in the country, then he is tending to injure not only the dignity and prestige but the authority of this House. We must all, in the transaction of our business here, be careful to see that we do it in such a way that we can maintain the prestige and dignity of Parliament and thereby maintain our authority. The Minister, from the point of view of putting the full cost of the scheme before the House, should again examine the cost and present some statement of his estimate of what the increased costs will be. At the tailend of the White Paper, pages 15 and 16, we find the various services that are going to be provided for the lower income group, the middle income group and for persons outside the lower income and middle income groups. I would ask the Minister to look at the headings under which information is given to us. Paragraph 40 says:— 'When the Government's proposals are fully implemented (see paragraph 38) the health services which will be available, without charge to the recipients except where otherwise stated, for different classes [78] may be summarised broadly as follows:—' I will now give the headings which the Minister has stated are not very different from those that are in the Bill. I give them as they are in the White Paper because they are in a convenient and in a clear way. The lower income group will be the recipients of the following services:— (a) General medical practitioner service. (b) Hospital and specialist services. (c) Medical and nursing care for mothers and infants (with choice of doctor). (d) Maternity cash grants. (e) Medicines and essential nutrients. (f) Child welfare and school medical services (including appropriate nursing services). (g) Dental and ophthalmic services. (h) Infectious diseases service. (i) Infectious diseases maintenance allowances. Now, under each of these headings there is, I take it, expenditure at the present time in respect of the lower income group. The Minister, therefore, either anticipates increased expenditure under these headings or he does not. I submit that he estimates that there will be increased expenditure. What is the objection to giving that information to the House under each of these headings. If the Minister thinks it prudent, for any reason, to give it otherwise, what is the objection to giving, under a group of headings, what the present day expenditure is for each of the last three years and information as to what will be the increased expenditure in the first year, the second year, the third year and the ultimate year in which these new services will be in operation. Can the Minister give any answer as to why he does not provide us with that information? As regards the middle income group, [79] the services that they may be the recipients of are as follows:— (a) Hospital and specialist services. (b) Medical and nursing care for mothers and infants (with choice of doctor). (c) Child welfare and school medical services (including appropriate nursing services). (d) Dental and ophthalmic services (a charge not normally exceeding half the cost may be made except in the case of the child welfare and school medical services). (e) Infectious diseases service. On some of these services there is perhaps, expenditure at the moment. At any rate, the Minister has to consider what the total cost is likely to be when each of these services is put into operation for what he calls the middle income group. What objection has the Minister to giving us that information? How can the Minister possibly ask the House, in view of the circumstances in which this Bill is put before us, to pass it without getting any information as to the cost of providing these additional services for the middle income group? I come now to the third class, that is, persons outside the lower income and middle income groups. Under the following heads they may be the recipients of the following services:— (a) Hospital and specialist services for— (i) Women in respect of motherhood and for infants up to six weeks of age. (ii) Persons whose family income exceeds £600 a year, who would suffer severe hardship if not regarded as eligible (see paragraph 24 (f)). (iii) All pupils of national schools in respect of defects discovered at school medical examinations. (b) Medical and nursing care for mothers and infants (with choice of doctor). (c) Child welfare and school medical [80] services (including appropriate nursing services). (d) Dental and ophthalmic services for children attending child welfare clinics and for pupils of national schools in respect of defects discovered at child welfare clinics and at school medical examinations. (e) Infectious diseases service. Under some of these headings, such as (d) and (e), there may be some small expenditure at the present time, but surely the Minister has made some kind of an estimate of what the ultimate cost is likely to be under each heading. I would, again, ask any person accepting responsibility for taking decisions in this matter, on the cost side alone, whether there can be any excuse for the Minister coming in here and saying that this whole thing is going to cost £1,800,000 while at the same time giving us no information of any kind in respect of services which are so clearly defined and of groups which he himself has very clearly defined. I suggest that the Minister is withholding from the House information that he must have. In doing so, he is not only treating the House with discourtesy and contempt but is undermining the authority of this Dáil as a national institution where the people's interests are supposed to be fully and adequately discussed and fully and adequately guarded and provided for. I say that the Minister, in treating the House in this particular manner, is undermining the authority of the House. I do not think that any section of the House can allow the authority of the House to be ignored or to be weakened in the country. The Minister, in one of his recent comments on the health situation—I do not know whether it was on the Bill or on the Health Estimate—held up the doctors as a group that, in declaring they were not going to co-operate in this Bill, were almost acting subversively towards the State. He suggested that there are countries to-day where, if a group of men did a thing like that, that soon very much more would not be heard of them. I say that it is the Minister primarily, particularly on this point alone of the question of the cost [81] of this measure, who is acting subversively towards this House, and is undermining the authority of this House. The Minister says £1,800,000. Certain estimates have been made. The last report for the Department of Health— 1950-51—at page 79 gives the estimated cost of local health services for the years 1947 to 1951, the amount met by local authorities and the amount met by the State. The total estimated cost of local health services for the year 1947-48 was £5,671,000 for the year 1950-51 it was £8,084,000. For the public assistance services which, in so far as the main amount is concerned, would seem to include the services covered by the types of services that we are concerned with in this Bill, that is as new and extended services, the cost in 1947-48 was £2,452,000, and in 1950-51, £3,045,000. An answer given by the Minister in the Dáil to a question put to him in the matter would seem to indicate that for the year 1951-52 it was £3,175,000. At any rate, the figure in the report for 1950-51 is £3,045,000. To my mind—I am open to correction by the Minister —the figures given under public assistance services would appear to be the total cost of the general type of services that are provided for here for the lower income group. In an article in Studies of March, 1953, on the new Health Bill, Father E. J. Coyne deals with this matter of estimate of cost. Dealing with the lower income group and the free services, he says:— 'The only yardstick of comparison which we have is the British cost. There it costs about £2 5s. per head to give everyone much the same ‘general practitioner services’ (including pharmaceutical, dental and ophthalmic) as are outlined in the Bill. Hence the free services of this nature for 1,000,000 persons (‘onethird of the population’) would cost about £2,250,000. The British cost per head of free institutional and specialist services is over £6. Hence our cost would be about £6,000,000: a total for the two sets of free services of £8,250,000 per annum.' That is for the lower income group. [82] A comparison by way of estimate can be seen on page 13 of Father Coyne's article where, dealing with some general matters, he says:— 'The community should ascertain what it costs per head to give the Bill's full services to the lower income group, who get them free, both the general practitioner and the hospital and specialist services. These are unlikely to cost less than £3 10s. or £4 per head: and are more likely to cost £5 10s. or £6.' Is the Minister not in a position to tell us what the lower income group general services cost at the present time, and is he not in a position to give us a figure showing what he expects the increase in costs to be because, on the figures indicated there, there would appear to be a substantially increased cost, more than the cost of which he has given an estimate? The figures are there plain enough. The estimate made by Father Coyne, after full examination of the whole thing, is given plainly there. My recollection of it is that it would cost an additional, say, £2,000,000 to give the services that are indicated there, substantially more than the Minister has indicated as the whole of the increased cost. For the middle income group, Father Coyne has taken something like 680,000 as the number of people who are paying national health insurance. The Minister, I think, has given another figure—something nearer 500,000. At any rate, taking the number of people with an income of £600 a year, the number of farmers and their dependents with a valuation of £50 and under, you are providing the middle income group with the hospital and the general services, everything except general practitioner services, that are being provided for the lower income group, and you are providing them free. If that is anything like the cost of these institutional services to the lower income group, there is something like £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 to be provided for there. If we are wrong in these calculations, it is up to the Minister to make us clear in the matter. As to the school medical services, [83] there is full information as to the number of children who are getting school medical services. There is full information as to the number of school children. The Minister is providing in an amendment that secondary school children and vocational school children will get the same medical services as the national school children. It is not yet clear whether the bill for the provision of these services will be given to the school authorities as far as secondary schools are concerned or to the local authorities as far as vocational schools are concerned, but the Minister ought to be able to tell us what is the cost of the school medical service for primary school children at the present time. The total number of primary school children who got free medical attention in the last year quoted in the Department's report is about 145,000 out of an average enrolment of 381,000 and an average daily attendance of 332,000, so that about one-third of the children in the national schools are examined annually. The child is examined every three years. Does the Minister intend under the new scheme that the child will be examined every year? Does he intend that the authorities of secondary and vocational schools will have to have an annual examination for their children, or are we going to require a particular standard of examination for the national schools and a higher one for the secondary and vocational schools? There must be some kind of an answer in the ministerial or departmental mind to that question. There must be some figure of cost as to the amount spent on school medical attendance at the present time: and it should be possible to give an estimate of the increased cost. These are matters, on the question of mere cost, in which I think the Minister is behaving in an astounding way in not giving information to the Dáil. In the general circumstances in which the Minister is pressing and hurrying this Bill, and in view of the position into which he has got himself with the medical profession, this is a very disruptive and destructive attitude for him to take up. The Minister questions Deputy [84] Costello's picture as to the extent to which the services that are promised in this Bill are actually going to be availed of either for the lower income groups or for the middle income groups but the Minister has only to look at the figures that he has quoted for the beds throughout the country. He has only to look at the conditions that face any county medical or surgical hospital in the country, to realise how false a picture is being created for our people. It is particularly disastrous on the mother and child side, because increasingly throughout the country women are desiring to go to hospitals for delivery and the Minister knows that there have been cases where doctors wanting to get a patient into a local hospital have found shocking conditions facing them when they brought the patient there. They found the accommodation limited to a certain number of beds but filled to beds twice that amount. The Minister might very well say that all these services cannot be provided immediately, but if that is so why cannot he pause now and see where he is going, in the circumstances that have been created between himself and the Department and the medical profession? The Minister complained here some time ago that the medical profession had quarrelled with Dr. Ward, had quarrelled with Dr. Browne and had quarrelled with himself and he could not understand that there could be any rhyme or reason or intelligence or honesty or any desire to serve on the part of a group of people that would so quarrel. My recollection is that, after we had opposed the 1945 Bill, dealing with only two-thirds of about 600 amendments in Committee for 15 days and then leaving any further discussion of the matter because of the attitude of the Minister, a month after our vigorous fight against the compulsive clauses of that Bill, the journal of the Medical Association wrote that there had been a certain amount of acrimonious discussion in the Dáil on the terms of the Bill but, speaking for the profession, the editor of the Irish Medical Association journal at that time considered that the profession were in favour of the Bill. Much as the Parliamentary Secretary at that time [85] was trampling on their judgement in certain matters, it was we here who were standing up against the compulsive clauses of that Bill and standing up for the liberty and the dignity of our medical services. Seven years have passed since that time. The Minister is in a great hurry now to point out that Deputy Costello is asking people in great difficulty to wait for another while, until he has an opportunity of providing a service for them. Yet the Minister is telling them that there must be still further delay. If there is to be still further delay in seeing that these very important and necessary services are provided, I ask the Minister to do what he was asked to do by the amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins on the Second Reading, that is, go either to his own Medical Health Council or to the organised representatives of the medical profession and have further discussion and consultation with them. I agree fully and completely with the aspect of the matter that Deputy Larkin put in the forefront of his statement on the 26th February, when he said that personally he felt that 'in many ways the doctor gives greater service to the community than a member of any other profession' and when he continued that it appeared to him that 'we fail to give the proper respect and credit to doctors to which they are entitled'. Deputy Larkin also said that 'if we are dealing with such a question as health, we must have not merely a philosophical approach but also a social approach'. The Minister cannot think that the health services and all that they imply —study and research and devotion to a very difficult and very exacting work— can be carried on by anybody but the doctor. We are talking of free medical services. We can see the Minister's outlook on what is likely to happen to the voluntary hospitals, in spite of his declared desire not to interfere with them in any way. He definitely has stated that, if the voluntary hospitals do not co-operate in a scheme such as this, for him, they will pass out of existence, that they will get into very grave difficulties and that he sees no [86] other ending and no other cure for that. The only free medical services that are provided in this country are those given by individual doctors in the voluntary hospitals and in a very widespread way throughout the whole of the country where doctors are giving the benefit of their professional skill to people for nothing. They do that because they have a concern for the condition of those people. That is the only free medical service, the only medical service that is not paid for in some way or another either by personal payment or by rates or taxes. It seems to me that that is the one free medical service of a high class that exists in this country at the present moment. These are the services that are going to be cleared out. It is quite true for Deputy Costello when he says that under this Bill there is likely to be no free medical services in the country. The doctors have issued a statement which I quote from the journal of the Irish Medical Association for April:— 'The following resolutions were passed unanimously at the meeting which had been convened to decide on the association's attitude to the Health Bill, 1952:— (1) That we, the members of the Irish Medical Association, desire to inform the heads of all Churches that we unanimously reject the proposals contained in the Health Bill, 1952, and refuse to co-operate should the Bill become law, on the following grounds:— (i) This Bill signifies in its essence the State control of the medical profession (ii) Under this scheme the State must enter unduly and very intimately into the life of patients and doctors (iii) In order to implement this Bill, the State must levy a heavy tax, by direct or indirect methods, on the whole community, independently of the desire or necessity of the citizens who will make use of the facilities that may be provided [87] (iv) In implementing this Bill by taxation, direct or indirect, the State will, in practice, morally compel its citizens to avail of its services (v) In implementing this particular scheme, the State must have recourse, in great part, to ministerial regulations, as distinct from enactments of the Oireachtas. (2) Resolved, that a Defence Committee be set up, which shall be representative of all branches of the profession, to devise ways and means to defeat this Bill. (3) Resolved, that authority be granted to branches and groups of the association to have published in the local newspapers advertisements and/or articles setting forth the views of this association on the Health Bill.' That is the position to which the organised medical profession has been reduced. We cannot but take cognisance of that and we cannot but appeal to the Minister not to go ahead with that situation as it is. We are prepared to examine the difficulties that the Minister has, or thinks he has, on any aspect of health policy between himself and the doctors. But we ought to have it plainly stated and we ought to be able to discuss the pros and cons here without being told that the cat was jumping in the country and that we were taking good stock of it. I do not know how many cats were jumping in the country in 1945 or 1946 when we were dealing with the Fianna Fáil proposals for health organisation then. I know that eight people went into the Lobby on the Second Reading division. Even if this Bill does go through its Committee Stage, I doubt that it will last as long as the two-thirds committee did on that other Bill. The Bill broke, although the organised Irish Medical Association indicated that the profession were rather in favour of it. There were not many cats jumping then. We are not bothering about cats jumping. We are bothering about what we can do through the instrument of this Parliament for people who have limited [88] resources and can only make use of these when every section of the people is working in a harmonious way to make the best of it. I ask the Minister to realise that the whole approach of his Government to administration and development and politics in this country is a totalitarian approach. The whole approach of the Department of Local Government to local authorities through the county managers has been part of an attempt to introduce more and more State control. One aspect of this which is seen in the ministerial offices is that since the Fianna Fáil Government got settled into office the technical advisers in any Department were no longer the heads of their department.",15/04/1953,14,4314,4315,not know how many cats were jumping in the country in 1945 or 1946 when we were dealing with the,Fianna Fáil,proposals for health organisation then I know that eight people went into the Lobby on the Second Reading division Even,Fianna Fáil,829514_3,,not know how many cats were jumping in the country in 1945 or 1946 when we were dealing with the Fianna Fáil proposals for health organisation then I know that eight people went into the Lobby on the Second Reading division Even,not know how many cats were jumping in the country in 1945 or 1946 when we were dealing with the proposals for health organisation then I know that eight people went into the Lobby on the Second Reading division Even,text402,1,0,0,0,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,0.016222142,0.000405554,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.451451451,0.446446446,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1122355,228,14,181,Debate on Adjournment: Government Policy.,13/12/1962,Mr. Brendan Corish,The Labour Party,Wexford,"I do not think anybody can deny that there will be unemployment as a result of free trade. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has admitted that on many occasions. Eighteen months ago, when it was suggested that we would make application for membership, the Minister for Industry and Commerce feared and forecasted unemployment and from the CIO reports that we have to hand, there is evidence that there will be unemployment. It is all very fine to talk about our cultural association with Europe and that sort of thing and, with respect to Deputy Dillon, it is all right to quote what President Kennedy said. It is all very fine to talk about the missionaries we sent abroad to Europe in the past seven or eight centuries but they are not the important things in present circumstances. The important things are those that Deputy Dillon spoke about, the ordinary working-class people. That is what we are concerned about. They have short lives to live and the first year of our membership of EEC is important to them. So is the second and the third and fourth and [1363] fifth and, for anybody to say that eventually things will be fine, eventually the nation will prosper, eventually German and French people will come in and establish factories, is of little avail. It may be all right for the fathers and mothers, the young men and the young women who will be living in this country ten or 15 or 20 years from now but what we are and should be concerned about are the workers who will be immediately affected by membership of EEC. In linen, cotton, rayon and footwear industries, there will be unemployment. I do not say there may be unemployment. The report of the CIO Committee which surveyed the industries reports that there will be unemployment. We should face that fact, and I do not think it is sabotage or treason for anybody to talk about the report of a committee set up by the Government which suggests we are going to have such unemployment. They suggest certain changes but they say that even if these radical changes are effected in these industries, even with that there will be people in those industries who will be rendered unemployed. They have recommended changes in these industries but what I am anxious to know is will these changes be made? Even if they are made, it is said, there will be some unemployment in these industries. These represent only two of the industries they are charged with surveying. I am informed there may be approximately another 50 industries to be surveyed. The pattern, as far as these industries are concerned, shows that there may be 2,000, 3,000 or, at most 4,000, rendered unemployed. Even if these industries change their systems and re-equip, if they do all these things, there will still be numbers who will be rendered unemployed. As Deputy Dillon said, is it pessimism to assume that the motor-car industry will scarcely be able to survive? I do not think we ought to go into these things, but it must be abundantly clear that they have less chance of surviving in the Free Trade Area. All the reports suggest disemployment. [1364] I do not think we should argue about the figures. Some economists say 40,000 other double that figure and still others have said 100,000. I do not think we should discuss whether it will be 40,000 or 100,000. If it were only 8,000 or 5,000, this House and the Government should be concerned about these people. We want to know how they will be provided for. It has been suggested that they will be provided for by the European Social Fund, a fund to which we will have access, if we become full members of EEC. I fear there are some people, and at least one Deputy, judging by a speech he made last week, under the impression that this Fund is to be used for compensation for unemployment or that, in fact, it is a sort of slush fund. It should be clear to members of this House at least that it is nothing of the sort but the Taoiseach has not helped the House in the replies he gave when questioned about the purposes for which the European Social Fund might be used. It is not unfair to say that on many occasions his answers have been evasive. There does seem to exist a wrong impression among some members of the House and among many people outside that the European Social Fund can do more than it is really intended to do. There is a pretty clear definition of the purposes for which this Fund can be used, the details of which are contained in a regulation drawn up by the EEC Commission which states that this Social Fund may be devoted to two particular purposes: one, the re-training or re-settlement of workers for productive employment and two, as assistance towards wages of workers who were temporarily unemployed as a result of plant conversion and who engage in the production of a new line or range. It seems clear from that that the Fund cannot be used as a slush fund and it certainly cannot be used merely to compensate for absolute unemployment. There are conditions set out also under which this money may be given to a Member State for the purposes I have mentioned. Assistance toward [1365] occupational training of unemployed workers can be granted only if the workers fulfil these conditions: (1) that they have not been able to obtain employment in activities similar to, or on the same level as, the activity they were previously engaged in (2) that after re-training, they enter new productive employment in the operations for which they have been re-trained and (3), that they have held productive employment for at least six months during the twelve months following the end of the period of training. It must be pretty clear that this Fund is only to be used to assist workers who are being re-trained for new jobs or rendered unemployed during the period when an industry is being re-equipped or changed in order to fit itself to engage in the production of a new line or a new range. It must also be remembered that any scheme for re-training must have the prior consent of the European Economic Commission. It has been pointed out here that this Fund will contribute only 50 per cent. of the cost of re-training and re-settlement and that this country as a member must contribute its share in accordance with its national income. Granted, in any case, that we can use the Fund, the question which then poses itself is this: for what are they being trained and for where? It comes down to this question of whether we are going to have the new industries to absorb these people, who will undoubtedly be disemployed as a result of our membership of EEC or, should I say, as a result of the stripping of protection from certain industries. What new jobs will there be? The Taoiseach hopes there will be new industries. The Taoiseach was questioned about those who will be rendered unemployed and have no chance of re-training or re-settlement. He said, in a sort of aside, that there would be so many industries that we need not worry about unemployment. Questioned further, he said he hoped there would be these industries. I suggest if the Taoiseach has any information he can disclose as to the establishment of new industries, now is the time to give it so as to assure these [1366] workers especially in regard to the industries which have been subjected to surveys and reports by the CIO. The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke recently and the speech he made on that occasion was not dissimilar to the speeches he frequently makes when he has occasion to open a new factory or a new petrol pump. He spoke last Saturday at the annual dinner of the Insurance Institute of Ireland and said, according to the Sunday Independent of December 9th, that in the first half of the year, 57 new factories were opened or were in course of construction, involving a capital investment of £18,000,000 and with an employment potential of nearly 10,000 people when they were in full production. I do not know how often we have heard forecasts like that. Every factory that is opened starts off with 30 people and eventually, we are told, it will employ about 500. If we added up the maximum forecast for all these industries, we would have to send to Australia, America and England to get people to come to man them. I hope the Minister's optimism in regard to the 57 factories will be realised but it does not seem to me that these factories, and any other factories we already have in operation, are going to absorb the numbers which will be rendered unemployed. The Committee on Industrial Organisation was charged with this job of surveying industries that they believed might be affected by free trade. They were charged also with making recommendations to the industries which they surveyed and to the Government. In an interim report, the CIO made certain recommendations to the Government. The principal recommendations are listed in the report and, on page 17, a summary of these principal recommendations is given. They recommend that legislation dealing with industrial grants should be increased to enable An Foras Tionscal to make grants in respect of projects which involve a switch over from one field of activity to another. They say there should be a change in respect of the scheme of technical assistance grants paid by the Department of [1367] Industry and Commerce they make recommendations in respect of the initial allowance and advise that it should be raised they make a recommendation in respect of loans to industry and in respect of credit facilities they also make certain recommendations to the Revenue Commissioners. The Government have accepted all these recommendations and the Government have even gone further and have said that when legislation is introduced and passed in Dáil Éireann to give effect to these recommendations, they will be given effect retrospectively to December 1961, so as to assist those who may be wavering or reluctant to make any change and those who made it any time since December, 1961. The Government are to be applauded for the speed with which they gave their approval to those recommendations and the way in which they acceded to the recommendation that any changes that would be made would be made retrospective to December 1961. But I want to ask, not so much the Taoiseach, but the House and the country, is there any guarantee or any indication that industries will avail of the Government aid which will be made available to them, when the new legislation will be, we hope, passed in the next session? The Taoiseach himself is sceptical as to whether they will or not. I wonder has there been any change since he spoke here on July 26 last on the Adjournment Debate when, at column 3371 of the Official Report he said: The number of industrial concerns which have already submitted proposals for State financial aid for re-equipment of their plants and for the expansion of their operations, is still far too few. I do not know whether or not it is still far too few because we have not any information on them. It is only when an Adjournment Debate is asked for or through Questions that the Government says anything about the Common Market. That is the last we hear of that aspect of the matter and [1368] of what is described as the challenge of the Common Market. It is five months since the Taoiseach made that statement. I want to ask him frankly does he believe, five months afterwards, that Irish industry is measuring up to those responsibilities that the CIO has talked about in regard to certain industries? As I said, the Taoiseach and members of the Government said immediately that they would accept the recommendations of the CIO but there are other recommendations by the CIO. In respect of certain industries, they made particular recommendations and I should like to ask the Taoiseach if there is any evidence that these recommendations are being given effect to. The Government are going to do their job, as far as the recommendations of the CIO are concerned, but is there any indication that Irish industry is going to do its job? If Irish industry either fails or refuses, if it fails to re-equip itself, to change its methods, and to accept the recommendations in respect of marketing, purchasing and so on, what is going to happen? Will we just sit back and say: 'Oh, well, Irish industry is not going to do it. What can we do then?' The Committee on Industrial Organisation in their Third Interim Report had this to say at paragraph 3: The primary responsibility for preparing itself to meet the trading conditions which will obtain when Ireland joins the EEC rest with industry. A necessary part of these preparations will, in most cases, be the creation of the appropriate organisations to sponsor the measures likely to improve the competitive position of individual industries. It is most desirable, therefore, that the maximum possible initiative in the formation of an Adaptation Council should be taken by the industry concerned. Since the problems to be dealt with by these organisations will vary from one industry to another, it would be unwise to attempt to lay down a standard pattern for them. Each industry must create the institution most suited to its needs. [1369] Paragraph 4 of the Third Interim Report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation goes on to say: The difficulties facing Irish industry under free trade conditions are so great, however, that means will have to be found to surmount these obstacles. We would urge firms to be guided by the inescapable needs of the situation in approaching the question of setting up these organisations. The Report goes on to deal with the main purpose of adaptation councils and it makes recommendations in respect of joint marketing, joint purchasing, factory design, training of workers and retraining and resettlement of redundant workers. I wonder what is being done in respect of those recommendations? It is not an adequate reply for the Government to say: 'We have done everything we have been asked. We have provided legislation to assist in re-equipping and changing and we have provided money.' If industry does not measure up to what has to be done, what do the Government propose to do? I think the Government will be expected to take steps to ensure that those industries which have a prospect of success in the Common Market are not allowed to fold up. Many workers and many families of workers depend on those industries, industries, which as has been said, have given valuable employment for 20, 30 or 40 years. We as the Parliament, and the Government as an Irish Government, have a duty to ensure that not only will the Government do what is required of them, but that industry will also. I want to make a brief reference to the speech the Taoiseach delivered himself of in Enniscorthy recently. I would not describe it as a very advisable sort of speech. There is no significance in the fact that he delivered it in Enniscorthy, except, I suppose, the fact that Fianna Fáil did so badly in Wexford in the last general election. I do not think that speech is calculated to get enthusiastic co-operation from all sections of the country. No matter what anyone else may think, I have always regarded [1370] the Taoiseach as a very forthright man, a man who did not engage in the same sort of ballyhoo at Fianna Fáil conventions as did his illustrious predecessor. The Taoiseach seems to be a different man when he gets up before a Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis, cumann meeting or convention. I would say that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party went even a little overboard during the past 18 months in appearing to give somewhat of a blank cheque to the Taoiseach in regard to our application for membership of the European Economic Community, in the matter of negotiations and in his general attitude. It is not for me to defend Fine Gael— far be it from me that I should have to defend them—but in Enniscorthy the Taoiseach rejected absolutely the support Fine Gael might give, and he wrote off the Labour Party as being a conservative party. The Taoiseach said: We know from experience that we can expect nothing from the Dáil Labour Party except the repetition of almost meaningless generalities and clichés with a continuous background chorus of pessimism. The Taoiseach should read the speech which he delivered to the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis in which he tried to pretend that the only thing that induced him to go into the European Economic Community was Partition. He trotted out the usual things which his predecessor used to trot out. It is unusual for Deputy Seán Lemass to have to resort to such tactics. I do not think that sort of speech is calculated to get the support — forget about the politicians — of the ordinary people who have so many fears about membership of the European Economic Community, who agree that we should join it in view of our circumstances, but who are fearful of what may happen. I think the Taoiseach should know also that the questions we have been asking from the Labour Party are the questions the trade unionists of this country are asking. They are the questions which were asked by members who attend the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and by members of [1371] the Taoiseach's Party. We have consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the various questions which arise in connection with our application for membership of the European Economic Community. We do not want to be the sore thumbs in this business of the Common Market at all. We know that ultimately the fate of all of us will be affected by membership of the European Economic Community, and we hope that membership will have good results. In the course of his speech, in an effort to whip up support for his Party, not support for the Common Market, the Taoiseach said that Fianna Fáil knew they would have to 'go it alone.' but that did not worry them. They are brave words but they will not be allowed to 'go it alone'.",13/12/1962,17,3109,3110,in an effort to whip up support for his Party not support for the Common Market the Taoiseach said that,Fianna Fáil,knew they would have to go it alone but that did not worry them They are brave words but they,Fianna Fáil,1122355_13,,in an effort to whip up support for his Party not support for the Common Market the Taoiseach said that Fianna Fáil knew they would have to go it alone but that did not worry them They are brave words but they,in an effort to whip up support for his Party not support for the Common Market the Taoiseach said that knew they would have to go it alone but that did not worry them They are brave words but they,text492,2,4,1,1,40,0.05,2,0.587786665,0.014694667,0.061095204,0.00152738,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.646646647,0.627627628,0.50950951,0.495495495,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2773408,946,8,137,Adjournment Debate. - Proposed Lay-Offs at Tallaght (Dublin) Plant.,10/05/1995,Ms. Mary O'Rourke,Fianna Fáil,Longford -Westmeath,"Thank you, Sir, for selecting this item for discussion and the Minister for coming into the House to reply. Perhaps the Minister would indicate if he has received the result of the ballot in Packard this evening. What happened in Packard last night—[1472] reports of which were repeatedly corrected — was bizzare. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, used a very strong word when referring to the matter. This industrial relations shambles is not the fault of the workers in Packard who, with commitment, last December and January embarked on productivity arrangements which they were assured would retain workers at the firm. While they expected layoffs, they did not expect 400 to be laid off indefinitely. When the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, returned from their travels a few months ago they informed us they had arranged a good deal and everybody was genuinely pleased with the outcome of the trip. The workers, in particular, believed the assurances they were given. They accepted the package of cuts and changes and were told there would be a sufficient level of work to sustain employment at the company. Packard is a big enough company to ensure that those assurances are kept. It can generate work for various components of the company in many parts of the world. We want the Minister to honour his commitments to the workers. What commitment did he enter into in Coventry and later when he met executives of Packard in the Davenport Hotel? We were relatively satisfied a reasonable approach was being adopted. It is time for firm action. The company has a future in the automotive components business and it is imperative that every effort is made by the Minister to ensure this. I understand from people in the firm that local management is not causing the difficulties. It has reached a satisfactory arrangement with the workers, but the orders come from abroad which forces it to change. This is presenting a very uneasy, chaotic and confused picture. What commitments did the Minister get from Packard? What will he do to ensure the shambles experienced by the workers yesterday, is not repeated? It is very difficult for workers in such [1473] circumstances to honour commitment and retain morale.",10/05/1995,27,127,128,they did not expect 400 to be laid off indefinitely When the Minister Deputy Bruton and the Minister of State,Deputy Rabbitte,returned from their travels a few months ago they informed us they had arranged a good deal and everybody was,Deputy Rabbitte,2773408_2,,they did not expect 400 to be laid off indefinitely When the Minister Deputy Bruton and the Minister of State Deputy Rabbitte returned from their travels a few months ago they informed us they had arranged a good deal and everybody was,they did not expect 400 to be laid off indefinitely When the Minister Deputy Bruton and the Minister of State returned from their travels a few months ago they informed us they had arranged a good deal and everybody was,text187,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.256205046,0.006405126,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.826826827,0.774774775,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2798070,306,9,111,Adjournment Debate. - Consultancy Fees.,25/10/1995,Mr. Jimmy Deenihan,Fine Gael,Kerry North,"An Bord Bia was established less than a year ago. The board was given a much wider brief than its predecessors. It was assigned a key role in the development of the Irish food industry and the creation of jobs and wealth that would flow from that. Two broad categories of consultancy service were provided to An Bord Bia in 1995. The most significant category refers to what may be termed 'once-off' costs relating to the establishment of the organisation and the formulation of its strategic plan for the period 1995-99. This category accounts for approximately 75 per cent of the expenditure. By their very nature, costs incurred under this heading will not recur in 1996. The second category, which is of much lesser significance in terms of overall expenditure, relates to ongoing activity in the areas of market research, product testing under the quality assurance programme, communications and product promotion. Such activity is central to the implementation of An Bord Bia's strategy by providing industry with quality information and promotional intelligence. In relation to my Department's expenditure of £325,399 to date, seven of the consultancies involved were entered into prior to the change of Government and these accounted for approximately £146,000 of this amount. As I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 190 on Tuesday, 24 October, the estimated total cost of consultancies to which the Department is committed is over £1. 1 million over £700,000 of that amount was contracted [1539] prior to 15 December 1994 by the previous Minister.

rst went on a committee of agriculture a very small percentage of Westmeath farmers were prepared to avail of the excellent educational services available through our agricultural instructors and poultry instructresses. I was often told by a farmer: 'I will put a graipe through one of them if he comes near the gate'. That was the mentality,but the committees of agriculture have done excellent work since in overcoming that mentality. Those committees consist of unpaid servants and they have done wonderful work down through the years for the farmers,in encouraging them and helping them to start classes and getting them to avail of the assistance that was available. It would be a bad thing if the Government infringed further on the rights and duties of these committees. It would be a good thing if there was less politics involved. Farmers' organisations should be allowed to nominate members to the committees. About four years ago,the then Minister for Agriculture,Deputy Smith,introduced a Bill,which was passed,which gave local committees of agriculture authority to elect one-quarter of their members from outside county councillors or farmers' organisations. When Deputy Blaney became Minister and had a row with the farmers' organisations,[1698] he bulldozed a Bill through this House which took away that right. That was a retrograde step. If the Minister wants to improve the system he should not do it by taking away the existing rights of committees. He could extend their rights and allow them to take in representatives of the various farming organisations. If you have government from the top and if you have people coming down from Dublin dictating to the farmers they will resent it,but if you have the local committee co-operating with the farmers and co-ordinating their efforts,then there will be some advance. I want to give full credit to the chief agricultural officers,to the agricultural instructors,to the poultry instructresses and the home farm economic advisers the vast majority of whom are doing excellent work. The Minister should be slow to take away this dual control because the local committees can get across to the farmers the type of information we all would like to get across to them. It might be no harm to state at this stage that we believe agriculture is under-capitalised. The Agricultural Credit Corporation have been doing reasonably good work in the last few years but if we are to prepare ourselves for entry into the EEC,then first of all the farmers' wives must have up-to-date houses and up-to-date kitchens,because if they do not have those,girls will not come to live in rural Ireland they should have water and sewerage services and so on. The farmers should have up-to-date outoffices and the most efficient ways of feeding their cattle,sheep and pigs. They should also have the most up-to-date farmyards. Farmers who have visited Denmark,Britain or other places return saying: 'Oh,you should see the farmyards they have abroad'. All this costs money and if the farmers are to adopt efficient methods and modern buildings,,then they will need extra capital. In the past,our farmers were wary about going to the banks and,indeed,it might be no harm to say that there is a type of credit squeeze on farmers today. It should be remembered that if a farmer did run an overdraft to £500 or £600,he has land,he has good [1699] security,but if the bank manager says to him,'I want that money back inside one month',he could cripple that unfortunate farmer. I have seen bank managers in County Westmeath crippling farmers because they demanded that overdrafts be reduced within a very short time. If the banks could go on strike and remain out for eight or nine months," they should give the farmers a reasonable time to reduce their overdrafts.

3758583,253,8,123,Written Answers - EU Directives.,20/03/2007,Mr. Brian Cowen,Fianna Fáil,Laoighis-Offaly,"There are eight EU Directives awaiting either transposition into Irish law, or formal notification of com[1410]pletion of transposition to the European Commission, by my Department at the current time. Directive 2005/60/EC is intended to strengthen legal measures to prevent the use of the financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing. Deadline for transposition is December 2007. The Department of Finance together with the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform has conducted an extensive consultation with interested parties. It is intended that transposition will be effected by means of a Criminal Justice Bill to amend or replace relevant provision of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The Reinsurance Directive (2005/68) has been partially transposed and notified to the Commission on the 30th August 2006. The deadline for full transposition is December 2007. The remaining articles will be transposed shortly. Directive 2006/79/EC was agreed in October 2006. Following consultation with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, it has been decided that it is appropriate to legislate in respect of this Directive and this will be done by way of a Statutory Instrument before end 2007. There is no deadline by which this Directive must be transposed. Council Directive 2006/112/EC: Deadline for transposition is 1 January 2007. SI No. 663 of 2006 was enacted to cater for the recast of the Sixth VAT Directive. On the advice of Parliamentary Counsel, this instrument is now being revoked in favour of its inclusion in Finance Bill 2007. Council Directive 2006/138/EC (19 Dec 06). Transposition is not required as the Directive is already provided for under Irish VAT Law. Arrangements are being made to notify the Commission formally in this regard. Council Directive 2006/98/EC (20 Nov 06) and Commission Directive 2006/84/EC (23 Oct 06) adapt a number of taxation directives to allow for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania and as such have a deadline of 1 January 2007. The Directives, which were published in the Official Journal in late December, are being actively examined by my officials. SIs are currently being prepared to cater for those aspects that require transposition. I expect that the draft SIs will be sent to the Parliamentary Counsel’s Office in the coming days. Council Directive 2006/97/EC (20 Nov 2006): Deadline for transposition is 1 Jan 2007. This Directive adapts certain Public Procurement Directives in the field of free movement of goods, by reason of the [1411]accession of Bulgaria and Romania. An investigation is ongoing to ascertain whether this directive needs to be transposed. Directive 2006/138/EC does not need to be transposed as it is already provided for under Irish VAT law, but the European Commission must be formally notified of this. Four directives (2006/112, 2006/98, 2006/84, 2006/97) are overdue for transposition since 1st January 2007. I can assure the Deputy that strong efforts are being made to complete the transposition and formal notification to the European Commission of these overdue directives at the earliest possible date. I am informed regularly by senior management about the up-to-date position with regard to European Directives under the responsibility of my Department awaiting transposition. In addition, my Department reports monthly to the Interdepartmental Committee on European Affairs, chaired by Minister of State Noel Treacy, on the status of outstanding directives. Every effort is being made in my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, to ensure that Directives are transposed on time.

4443730,2205,8,132,Mortgage Arrears: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members] (Continued),27/03/2013,Mr. Niall Collins,Fianna Fáil,Limerick West,"Some of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes's colleagues asked the question, why now. They should have asked, why is Fianna Fáil raising this matter again. My colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, alluded to the passage of the personal insolvency legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas. We sought, by way of amendment on Committee and Report Stages, to establish an independent appeals mechanism as part of the personal insolvency regime being introduced. We welcomed and supported the main thrust of the legislation, but it is deficient and limited, as there is no participation by an independent third party to try to bring about a dispute resolution mechanism and disputes will undoubtedly occur. The purchase of a home by a person or young couple is one of the most significant and landmark transactions they will make in their lifetimes. Currently, 94,000 people find themselves in a dire set of circumstances. Instead of having a capital asset which is appreciating in value, they have a liability which is growing in size. We are more than two years into the term of the Government, but we still have not progressed this matter significantly enough to give the people concerned hope. As a practising public representative, like everybody else in this House, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, will know there are independent appeals processes for every State-backed scheme. There is an independent social welfare appeals mechanism, including for jobseeker's, carer's and domiciliary carer's allowance and for medical cards. We have the Office of the Ombudsman and if one goes through the planning process, there is an independent appeals mechanism. There is the Employment Appeals Tribunal to deal with employment disputes. One can even appeal through the various courts. There is also an independent appeals mechanism to deal with third level grants. We are now faced with a situation where the banks ultimately have a veto. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is in the same wing of Fine Gael as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who, to his credit, is always clear. Does the Minister of State trust the banks? Will he give us a straight answer? Does he trust the banks to deliver on their promise under the legislation? I will be interested to hear his response. There is no fairness in the thrust of the legislation. Much of what the Minister for Finance is bringing forward does not have fairness as a central tenet. For example, if one looks at local property tax, the Minister has not recognised inability to pay. There are some limited deferrals and some other minor reliefs. In my constituency alone there are 25 unfinished housing estates. Those living on these estates who are all in negative equity are liable for local property tax. Many of the 94,000 people in mortgage arrears are living on such estates and are liable for local property tax. These estates are largely unfinished and there are serious public liability issues attached to them. Many of them should be demolished. We will have sight of what are considered reasonable living expenses when the guidelines are published. There was a leak to the newspapers, to which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, referred. One person's reasonable living expenses would represent a barrier for another and his or her family. For example, is the Minister seriously thinking of removing the ability to maintain private health insurance cover for? Today in my local hospital, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, people were asked not to attend the accident and emergency department unless the emergency was genuine. What message does that send?

2650374,259,9,41,Northern Ireland: Statements (Resumed).,01/04/1993,Mr. Michael Creed,Fine Gael,Cork North-West,"I thank Deputy Barry for sharing his time with me. Northern Ireland has been in turmoil for almost a quarter of a century. The statistics of thousands dead and maimed have been repeated so often that we are in danger of becoming desensitised and almost dehumanised as a community to the full horror and pain they represent. The extent of the problem becomes apparent when one considers that more than 3,000 people have been killed. Comparatively speaking, a greater percentage of the population has died in Northern Ireland since the conflict began there than died in the American Civil War. For this reason alone, this debate is especially welcome we must never allow ourselves as a nation to become indifferent to or aloof from the problems in Northern Ireland. [225] Northern Ireland has been a problem on the political agenda of this House for a long time. It is a problem of equal proportions, if dissimilar in nature, to the many economic problems confronting this Assembly. The problems in Northern Ireland contribute in a very tangible way to the economic problems of this country. In addition to being a human and political tragedy, the problems in Northern Ireland have had enormous economic consequences. Countless millions of pounds and punts have been invested and exploded in Northern Ireland and much needed investment has been discouraged because of the troubles. The name of Ireland has been sullied throughout the world by ruthless gunmen acting in our name and in defiance of democracy by perpetrating their carnage on innocent victims. Their most recent atrocity in Warrington is neither excusable nor was it accidential. Rather, it is part of a strategy designed to inflict terror in the hearts of people and destabilise the institutions of the State and people's confidence in them. The ritual condemnation of violence has become part and parcel of our political process. The vocabulary used in these condemnations has been well nigh exhausted at this stage. The time is now right for us to move meaningfully and with purpose onto a new agenda which hopefully will bring about a lasting settlement of the Northern problem. Having said that, important opportunities such as this debate have to be used to restate our total opposition to violence and intimidation as a means of achieving political goals. To put it simply, the bomb and the bullet have no role to play in our society they are the tools of the politically inept, the weapons used by those who have been rejected by the democratic process. Those elected by the democratic process have enormous responsibilities in this context. Public representatives in Northern Ireland are not living up to these responsibilities and the vacuum is being filled with the blood of innocent victims who have been killed by terrorists who thrive in this vacuum. The resolution [226] of these problems does not rest solely in Northern Ireland or among its elected representatives. The two traditions in the North look in different directions in terms of the State to which they believe they properly belong. The British and Irish Governments must also play their part in resolving these problems. Political posturing and fragmentation in regard to Articles 2 and 3 for political gains, and political inaction on the question of improved extradition procedures, do not help resolve the problems. 'Green' political statements made by Members of the Government parties, including the Taoiseach, which are of relevance only to a bygone era, serve no purpose. They further delay dialogue, send wrong signals and fuel further Unionists intransigence. To put it simply, such statements have not helped to resolve these difficult problems rather they have added to them. The challenge facing us today in terms of Northern Ireland is the creation of new arrangements and political structures and institutions to accommodate the legitimate aspirations of the two traditions, namely, the right of the Nationalists to effective political and administrative expression of their identity and the right of Unionists to effective political and administrative expression of their identity, ethos and way of life. Dominance or victory for either tradition is no solution. New arrangements not acceptable to both will ensure continuing violence. In this regard, I am glad the Government has rejected the idea mooted by John Hume, the leader of the SDLP, of a solution foisted by the two Governments on the two communities, and I am glad to read the Government's response to this which stressed the importance or renewed talks. However, we need Government action now in this regard. Talk about talks is cheap. With regard to Northern Ireland it is all too easy to despair. Increasing paramilitary violence and political intransigence have driven the people to the streets. Twenty thousand people marched in Dublin as a response to the latest acts of violence perpetrated in England [227] and in Northern Ireland last Sunday. Similar marches were held throughout the country. This is, first and foremost, an expression of revulsion by ordinary people, North and South, of violence as a means to a political end. It is also an expression of frustration with the political process. We, as democratically elected politicians, must take our cue from this. The constitutional political parties must never despair as this plays into the hands of the terrorists. This is the time for brave action in search of a political solution and for effective extradition arrangements from this country. A little over 12 months ago I had occasion to visit Northern Ireland, especially Derry and Belfast. It was informative, if somewhat disheartening. However, I believe there are straws in the wind that offer some hope. In Derry, a Nationalist-dominated council shares power with Unionists, and today there is a Unionist mayor from the Democratic Unionist Party. Unfortunately, in Belfast Unionists' intransigence means they cannot even fete our olympic medalists when they return victorious. Further evidence of change for the better can be found in the fact that some Unionists have already come to Dublin and spoken. It can be found in the fact that the Northern Ireland issue is high on the political agenda both in this country and in the United Kingdom. I believe the election of Mary Robinson as President will be interpreted in the North as a sign of the creation of a more open and pluralist society down here. Furthermore, I believe that expressions from some elements of the prison community, who are a very important element in the North, questioning the continuing operation of the arms struggle are significant. Indeed, we have heard voices from Sinn Féin saying that no-one can be coerced into a united Ireland. There is also the possibility of Unionist leaders emerging with some vision and policies, leaders who will break the mould in terms of reactionary intransigence that has, for too long, been the sole response of the [228] Unionist community in Northern Ireland. All in all, I believe an historic cocktail may be beginning to emerge and converge. It is our role as democratic, constitutional representatives of the people to use every means at our disposal to facilitate the emergence and convergence of this cocktail. It may be some time in the future, but better to light a penny candle than curse the darkness.",01/04/1993,27,3,4,I thank,Deputy Barry,for sharing his time with me Northern Ireland has been in turmoil for almost a quarter of a century The,Deputy Barry,2650374_1,,I thank Deputy Barry for sharing his time with me Northern Ireland has been in turmoil for almost a quarter of a century The,I thank for sharing his time with me Northern Ireland has been in turmoil for almost a quarter of a century The,text176,2,1,0,0,22,-0.045454545,-1,-0.510825624,-0.023219347,0.085280287,0.003876377,0.123123123,0.101101101,0.186186186,0.161161161,0.553553554,0.648648649,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1333393,824,14,115,"An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1968: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il). Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968: Committee Stage (Resumed).",06/06/1968,Mr. Patrick Norton,The Labour Party,Kildare,"Tairgim Leasú a 3: I move Amendment No. 3: I gCuid I, fo-alt 2º a scriosadh agus an méid seo a leanas a chur ina ionad:— '2º Is do réir na hionadaidheachta cionmhaire agus ar mhodh an aon-ghotha ionaistrighthe a toghfar na comhaltaí.' agus I gCuid II, fo-alt 2º a scriosadh agus an méid seo a leanas a chur ina ionad:— '2º The members shall be elected on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.' In Part I, to delete subsection 2º and substitute the following:— '2º Is do réir na hionadaidheachta cionmhaire agus ar mhodh an aon-ghotha ionaistrighthe a toghfar na comhaltaí.' and In Part II, to delete subsection 2º and substitute the following:— '2º The members shall be elected on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.' In spite of insinuations made last night by Deputy Fitzpatrick that my amendment was not in keeping with the Second Reading of the Bill before the House, I think it was amply demonstrated by the Taoiseach that he was concerned mainly with the difficulties of the single-seat constituency when he spoke introducing this Bill. Indeed, he went to great lengths and dealt in considerable detail with the undesirable problems to which the multi-seat constituency gave rise. He explained in considerable detail the hypocrisy in which Deputies were encouraged to engage by pretending to interfere in the day-to-day administration of matters in which they had little or no influence. He explained that this was a source of great friction between Deputies, especially when these Deputies were members of the same Party. By engaging excessively in this type of rat race to curry favour with [668] constituents, Deputies were tending to neglect their primary duties as legislators. The Taoiseach explained that the single-seat constituency would encourage the Deputy to avoid appearing partisan for any one section of his constituents and that in time this would tend to build up a better community spirit and that the smaller area would lead to a greater knowledge of and intimacy with his constituents. Because of the direct comparison between one candidate and another at elections, the Parties would be encouraged to put forward candidates of the highest calibre and this would all help to improve the standard of the national Parliament. The Minister dealt at great length with the long counts which are a feature and are becoming more a feature of multi-seat constituencies. He mentioned the haphazard methods in transfers and the large element of luck involved, especially when you get results involving ten, 15 or 20 counts. He mentioned that the average person could not possibly decide the relevant merits of high preference votes. He mentioned that at the Fianna Fáil ArdFheis resolutions calling for the single-seat constituency were passed almost unanimously. He made a case for the single-seat constituency and mentioned the needless competition, the sham, the bluff and the pretence to which the multi-seat constituency gave rise, not to mention the greatly inflated cost of administration which arose from this unnecessary competition between Deputies and the consequent high costs which in turn lead to higher taxation. The Minister said, on two occasions, since the Bill was introduced, that he was mainly concerned with obtaining the single-seat constituency and less concerned with the actual method of voting. I agree with both the Taoiseach and the Minister in what they have said regarding the single-seat. I am in favour of the single-seat constituency and the straight vote. I believe that in a relatively short time this would lead to a two-Party system which would make democracy meaningful. I think the present system of proportional [669] representation is an inefficient and cumbersome method of choosing Deputies. Because I believe that at the present time the straight vote is not acceptable to the electorate as a whole and because I believe it would be a national tragedy if we failed to secure any type of parliamentary reform, I tabled this amendment which would give us, I believe, a happy and honourable compromise. Those of us who believe we need the greater efficiency which the single-seat would give us would be satisfied, while those of us who believe in the necessity of retaining the principle of PR would also be accommodated. I think this is a reasonable approach to the problem. I believe the public at large would be glad to accept it as a happy compromise. Otherwise we will be in a position that, no matter who wins the referendum, it is obvious that there will be a large number of voters who will be dissatisfied. We will have the unnecessary and pointless division of the people over something on which there could be unanimity. I know there are selfish men in all Parties who are not concerned with constitutional reform but are concerned mainly with themselves. I know there are some Opposition Deputies who believe, rightly or wrongly, that if the Government can be stampeded into going ahead with the straight vote, they will be defeated and therefore they feel—putting their Party interest before the national interest—the Government should be encouraged to go ahead. I can only hope the Government will not be so foolish as to take this misguided course. Opposition Deputies have insinuated that I should never have tabled this amendment. Indeed, some have gone so far as to suggest I was encouraged to do so by the Minister himself or some other member of the Government. I can only reject this as childish nonsense. I would like to inform the members of the Opposition that it is my right—and indeed, as I see it, my duty—to table this amendment and have it discussed by the House, even if in doing so I am endangering the selfish ambitions and the security of [670] tenure of some of those who shouted loudest because I have exercised my right and performed my duty in doing so. The public interest which has been shown in this amendment is ample proof that I am not alone in this belief. I am not really concerned about the reflections on my character made by some members of the Fine Gael Party. I will confess I was disappointed that one prominent member of the Fine Gael Party, an ex-inter-Party Cabinet Minister and an ex-colleague of my father at that, of whom I thought better and from whom I expected more, suggested that because I took a different point of view from that which he took, there was something dubious in the whole thing and that I had no right to hold a different point of view. The crowning insult was when he dragged in my father's name and started attributing to him opinions and views which I know my father did not hold, in order to lend stature and respectability to this gentleman's out-of-date and old-fashioned ideas. This Fine Gael gentleman was very careful not to attack the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, for holding the same views on PR as I hold. I wonder was this an omission or was it a calculated act on his part? Was I being used as a whipping boy by this gentleman to attack his Leader—which he did not dare do publicly? Was he afraid to attack the Leader of his Party, or is his own integrity suspect? A great deal has been said by Opposition Deputies about the moral right of the Government to introduce a referendum now, since it is only ten years since the previous referendum was introduced and discussed. Indeed, so many Front Bench Members of both Parties made such a debating point of this that I feel I should like to refer to it. I would think it is reasonable to assume that the average voter votes over a period of 50 years of his life. If we assume that he commences to vote at 21 years and that he votes until he is 71 years, that would give us a period of 50 years. It is obvious that not every voter will vote when he is 21, and that many voters will continue to vote long after they are 71, [671] but for a variety of reasons, it is also quite obvious that not every voter will vote for the full period either. I would think that an average of 50 years is a pretty fair estimate of the voting life of most people. If we take 50 years as the average voting period, this means that in ten years the electorate would have a turnover of 20 per cent. At the previous referendum 58 per cent only of the electorate in fact voted and expressed an opinion. This means that not less than 42 per cent of the electorate did not express any opinion whatsoever. If we add this 42 per cent who did not express any opinion to the 20 per cent who will have reached voting age since then, we find that not less than 60 per cent of the electorate have not in fact expressed an opinion or have not had an opportunity of expressing an opinion on this question. If to the total of the 60 per cent we were to add the percentage of people who will have changed their minds since then, in either direction, on the merits or demerits of the straight vote, we find a position where possibly two-thirds of the people have not had an opportunity to express any opinion, or who could have changed their minds since then. If we bear in mind that the previous referendum was defeated by only two per cent of the electorate and that at least 60 per cent odd have not had the opportunity to express their opinion, it is obvious that the referendum is wide open. The result might be anything, and the Government not only have a moral right but, indeed, on such a critical issue, a duty to introduce this referendum. This point was carefully concealed by the Opposition, or perhaps they did not realise it or look at it that way. It is certainly worthy of their attention. Another point raised was the cost of the referendum and a great deal of foolish and unnecessary talk was indulged in on that point. A figure of £100,000 was mentioned. At the previous referendum approximately 1,000,000 voted. If you divide a cost of £100,000 by 1,000,000 people, it works out at approximately 2/- per [672] voter. Does any Deputy seriously consider that the electorate are not worth considering because it would cost 2/-to get a man's opinion? With our glorified fight for freedom, home rule and independence, can it be that after 50 years of self-government we do not think it worth spending 2/- per voter in order to find out the opinion of the electorate? These points were so talked about and used to misguide the people that I thought I should mention them, whether or not they are strictly relevant. I put down this amendment simply enough and I took the wording in the Constitution, Article 12, section 2, subsection 3º, dealing with the method of voting for the election of the President. This treats the whole country as one constituency with one seat and declares: The voting shall be by secret ballot and on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. My amendment reads: The members shall be elected on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. I deleted the words 'by secret ballot' because this is already provided for in the section. My amendment has the merit of using a form of words which has already been approved in the Constitution, and about which there could be little or no valid argument. I do not want to repeat the arguments which have been made ad nauseam on Second Stage as to the respective merits or demerits of PR and the straight vote. I have already made it clear both in this House and outside that I am anxious to reform the Constitution in the interests of efficiency and political stability. I believe that we should have the single-seat system, that we should have the two-Party system, that we should have a system that would give us real democracy, that we should have a system which would give us a genuine Opposition which would offer constructive counter ideas to those proposed by the Government and not merely an Opposition opposing for opposition's [673] sake, an Opposition that would offer the people the choice of an alternative Government if they should so desire, an Opposition that would not use this Dáil as a status symbol club, an Opposition that would be really competitive and that would have fresh ideas and a sense of urgency, and not a club where all the power lies in the hands of the ruling few who are in danger of becoming complacent because there is no real or vigorous opposition. In introducing the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the Taoiseach said the primary concern was not to maintain Fianna Fáil in office, that naturally he would wish his Party to continue to be the Government but that that was not the primary concern. I accept that statement. Like all Members of the House, I respect the Taoiseach's integrity and hold him in high esteem but I do not think the motivation behind this Bill is important. In any event, the result would be the same. At election time this can produce big swings. This will ensure that while the tide is running for the present Government they will have a larger majority, and when the tide turns against them we will have a complete break, a clean sweep, and a strong alternative Government. We have become so stagnant in this Parliament that the danger is that the centre of debate will pass from the House to outside bodies whose members and motives might be more suspect than we are ourselves.

1704407,416,8,145,Private Members' Business. - EEC Regional Fund: Motion.,17/06/1975,Mr. Sean Flanagan,Fianna Fáil,Mayo South,"If I may repeat the terms of the Motion, they are: That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's expressed intention of using the EEC Regional Fund to recoup past expenditure to the Exchequer and demands that the Fund be used to finance a special regional development programme in the less-developed parts of the country. I think that Deputy George Colley has done the House, and all of us who are interested in regional development, a great service by bringing forward this Motion. I congratulate him on his opening speech in which he gave expression to the fears felt by all of us, who have an interest in regions in general and some regions in particular, as a result of certain statements made by the Minister for Finance. I am, like Deputy Barry Desmond, a member of the joint committee of both Houses and I have no doubt about Deputy Desmond's sincerity in everything that he says but I do want to put it to you, sir, that we, in the West of Ireland, have no reason, in the middle of 1975, to trust a Dublin oriented Government and, in particular, we have no reason to trust the present Minister for Finance. The people down the country would not be calling Deputy Richie Ryan a Machiavellian Minister, they would be calling him things in much blunter and less-sophisticated language.

717356,674,22,154,"Financial Resolutions. - Social Welfare Bill, 1949—Committee Stage (Resumed).",03/05/1950,Mr. Seán MacEntee,Sinn Féin,Monaghan South,"I was rather astonished at the flippancy with which the Minister disposed of the representations which Deputy Cowan made on behalf of rural agents. Listening to him when he protested that he was not responsible for the salaries which they now enjoy, it rather reminded me of a historical hand-washing operation because, after all, the Tánaiste is the Minister who is responsible for the National Health Insurance Society. When I was speaking last night on Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment No. 4, he endeavoured to make the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for the administration of the society very specific and very definite. He asked me if I would not go to the people who had come to me and asked me to make their case, and ask them whether they did not prefer his method of dealing with it to my method. I see in that an admission that the Tánaiste, had he wished to improve the conditions of any officer or servant of the National Health Society, could have done so by personal interference on his part. That is the suggestion he was making last night. To-day, however, when Deputy Cowan draws his attention to the position of certain outdoor servants of the society who operate in Connaught, he disclaims responsibility. He treats the matter with a jocoseness that ill becomes the Tánaiste, who was at one time the chairman of the Labour Party and who is supposed to be concerned with the position of the under-privileged classes, as he would probably describe them, in the State. To-day they were the subject of fun for the Tánaiste. He was able to speak of their condition with a great deal of complacency, and apparently with some amusement and enjoyment, when he was discussing the matter with Deputy Cowan.

4034138,580,9,147,Order of Business.,24/11/2009,Mr. Enda Kenny,Fine Gael,Mayo West,"I object to the Order of Business. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Dáil sits until 9. 50 p. m. and that we have a three-hour debate on the consequences of flooding, including 30 minutes of questions and answers with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Fine Gael will set aside its Private Member’s time between 7 p. m. and 8. 30 p. m., No. 43. should be taken for 80 minutes from 8. 30 [456]p. m. and the debate on agriculture should be postponed until Thursday. I do not want this to be like the landings at Dunkirk. This is a matter of extreme importance to people. We have listened on umpteen occasions to members of the Government talking about Dáil reform. As we sit in the comfort of this leather lined Chamber, people are under five feet of water in their homes, businesses and on their farms. This reflects a gulf, which is filled with anger and misgiving because Government support has evaporated. Today is the halfway point of the Government, which took up office on 24 May 2007. Its integrity is in shreds, its credibility is in tatters and it has lost the moral authority to lead. If the Government cannot respond in this House to give Members, who represent farmers, housewives, young people and everybody else, the opportunity to speak up and give the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Government the facts of life from village, town and city, then we will have failed in our duty. We talk about Dáil reform. Here is an opportunity to allow for a three-hour debate led off by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Every Member should have ten minutes, which would be followed by a question and answer session, to give the Minister further information in order that he would have a more complete and deeper analysis of what is happening. If we are not able to do that, the House will have failed in its duty to people who this evening are in darkness and who are worried, concerned and anxious because they do not know where the next flood will come from or what will happen. Despite the good work of the emergency services and the local authorities, it is an important function in our democracy that the representatives of the people in the House of Parliament be enabled to speak out on an issue that is unprecedented and that is a once in 800 years happening. The River Shannon is a foot and a half higher than it was in 1954. If the Ceann Comhairle thinks this is not worthy of consideration under Standing Order 32, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party, the Green Party, the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party, Independent Members and Sinn Féin be enabled to speak out and inform the Minister and Government of how important a matter this is.",24/11/2009,30,488,489,that Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party the Green Party the Labour Party the Fine Gael Party Independent Members and,Sinn Féin,be enabled to speak out and inform the Minister and Government of how important a matter this is,Sinn Féin,4034138_6,,that Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party the Green Party the Labour Party the Fine Gael Party Independent Members and Sinn Féin be enabled to speak out and inform the Minister and Government of how important a matter this is,that Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party the Green Party the Labour Party the Fine Gael Party Independent Members and be enabled to speak out and inform the Minister and Government of how important a matter this is,text91,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,0,0.176140969,0.004635289,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.721721722,0.690690691,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3907216,1091,14,117,Financial Resolution No. 15: (General) (Resumed).,23/10/2008,Mr. Jack Wall,The Labour Party,Kildare South,"In speaking on budget 2009 I ask Government Members, individually or collectively, what are their lasting impressions of the election of 2007 or any house calls and canvassing they have carried out since the election. I wonder what impressions they had of the rented accommodation sector. For me, the large and obvious gap between the rich and very poor in society is a most sobering thought. According to information given to the House last week by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, rent and mortgage subsidies are paid to approximately 72,000 people. While the majority of this group receive rent subsidy, I understand an increasing number of people are applying for mortgage interest supplement, largely due to the substantial increase in unemployment in recent months. While canvassing and making house calls, it is easy to pinpoint dwellings in the rented accommodation sector. They often have broken gates or damaged gate piers and in many cases wall capping has fallen down or been removed, gardens are not tended and doors and windows are unpainted and in poor condition. Despite the best efforts of the tenant, interiors are usually damp and have poor ventilation and plumbing and other problems in need of repair. In most instances, oil or gas fired central heating is the only means of heat and in practically all cases the heating system is unusable due to the cost of fuel. This week another application was made to increase gas prices. Tenants will point out that landlords are not easily accessible because they tend to use agents who seldom want to hear complaints by occupiers. Thus, the lot of the private rented tenant is not a happy one. Given the declining number of local authority houses and large waiting lists for such houses, the position will remain unchanged for some time. From my knowledge of local authority housing, most residents are old age pensioners, single parents and young couples seeking to get on to the first rung of the home ownership ladder. All of them receive social welfare payments. Under the heading 'Considerations to bear in mind' in Annex B of the Minister for Finance’s budget booklet, it is stated: 'The Social Welfare measures in Budget 2009 will accrue mostly to those at the lower end of the income distribution who, without such measures, would experience a significant deterioration of their income in relative terms.' This assessment does not correspond with the fact that while the Minister gave the groups to which I referred €7, he clawed back €5 of this sum by increasing the rent supplement contribution. How can the Government stand over this measure which will have tragic consequences for those seeking to cope with increases in the cost of living? It is difficult to understand the Green Party’s approach given its previous vocal support for tenants in the private rental sector. Yesterday, I listened to Deputy Cuffe offer his party’s full support to senior citizens. Where does the Green Party stand on the rent subsidy? Will it support the provision increasing the subsidy by only €2 from 1 January 2009? Will the party [34]bring that to the attention of the Minister for Finance? How in God’s name could it be so cold, callous and uncaring of a sector that obviously cannot stand up for itself, due to fear of recrimination by the landlord? It is unforgivable of the Green Party because there are guidelines appropriate to this case. I was glad to receive them recently from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, when I had an issue with a local authority that had increased rent payments for those in receipt of social welfare payments over and above that specified in the Department’s guidelines. The guidelines are included in circular letter HRT3/2002 'Rents of Local Authority Dwellings', section 4 and it is fair to assume that a common line can be taken to the effect that if a Department issues such a circular, a sister Department, especially the Department of Social and Family Affairs will adhere to such a directive, given that it is specific to persons in receipt of social welfare payments. The guidelines state: It is important that authorities should ensure that rent increases do not absorb an excessive amount to income of tenants on low incomes dependent on Social Welfare payments and in particular, old age pensions. As a general guideline it is considered that no more than a 15% increase in such pension income should be absorbed by an increase in rent. In this budget the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has thrown out the window any referral to such guidelines. In fact she has increased the rent by 71%, leaving the recipient with a weekly increase of just €2. She gave €7 with one hand and took back €5 with the other. How does this fit in with the guidelines I have just quoted from and how does it fit with the Minister for Finance’s statement on the very first page, second paragraph, that the budget aimed to protect those who were most vulnerable? Surely there are some within Fianna Fáil, and especially in the Green Party as well as the two Independents who support the Government, who see this proposal for those in rented accommodation is totally unacceptable, and will not support it in the social welfare Bill soon to come before the House. The Labour Party will fight this issue tooth and nail, at every available level, both in and outside the House. I ask the Green Party and the two Independent Deputies to take the matter on board and make it an issue before the social welfare Bill comes before the House. In looking at other aspects of the budget, I am disappointed with the decision to put the decentralisation programme for Kildare on hold. The decision to stop, halt, review or whatever means that 560 employment opportunities through the placement of the Revenue Commissioners offices in Athy and Kildare in my constituency are stopped. My disappointment is increased by the fact the IDA has publicly stated in recent local newspaper reports that it is having major difficulties in attracting industry to the constituency. Unfortunately, it is not too difficult to see why, when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment informs me that only two itineraries have been arranged by the IDA to my constituency in five years. If the Government wants to commence an upturn in employment, it will have to put in place incentives for SMEs, to increase employment and ensure that new SMEs are given seed capital to create employment in areas such as Kildare, where there has been an enormous increase in the unemployment figures. The increase in the live register is up 70% in Newbridge, 56% in Athy and 65% in Maynooth. The budget does nothing to create optimism in this area, with a reduction in capital expenditure for indigenous industry to Enterprise Ireland of 29%. The State agencies, in agreement with the local authorities, should and must provide incubation units on an organised basis, with seed capital being provided through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to kickstart local initiatives, to ensure employment growth in such areas. In a constituency where there have been high levels of unemployment, obviously there will be delays in pro[35]cessing claims, as in the local central office in Newbridge. Yesterday, I listened to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs agreeing with this. I ask the Minister to address this matter and ensure extra people are enlisted to assist the overworked staff who are seeking to meet demands under such duress. I note Deputy Nolan from Carlow is in the House. In the area of Carlow and south Kildare there has been a huge employment haemorrhage over the past couple of years. We have seen Låpple and Irish Sugar close and Shuttleworth in Athy move on. A whole raft of companies has gone among them some replacement industries that have moved on to other locations. With this in mind I say to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland that they have failed badly as regards providing alternatives or new employment in that particular area. Cuts in the Department of Education and Science budget will affect a constituency where there are children from many nations. I visited a school recently where there were 27 different nationalities, putting enormous pressure on the education system. The Minister must revise this position to ensure class sizes are reduced, as promised before the general election of 2007, to ensure every child, whatever his or her nationality, gets an equal opportunity to receive a proper education. The medical card debacle is something no caring Government should have allowed itself to become involved in. The Government did not do the ground work to establish such changes were needed beforehand. The four-word adage, 'Think before you ink' was never more relevant than in this instance. Recent press statements from Mr. Maurice Ahern, brother of the former Taoiseach, are relevant in this regard. It is obvious that over a long period the Department of Finance wanted the Government to come to grips with the universality of the health system. In fairness to the previous Taoiseach, he repelled such approaches every time. I have never had so many calls from concerned senior citizens and family members seeking information, advice and general assurances with regard to the totally unacceptable withdrawal of medical cards. Even people not directly affected, but who wanted to lend support to a neighbour or a friend, contacted me. The universality of the health service, education and the social welfare system is a corner stone of Labour Party policy, and we will not relent in fighting for their protection. Among the letters I got over the past few days was one from a person in north Kildare. He said not enough had been said about the mental impact on those over 70 who were now being forced to worry about, and fill in even more forms. This, in itself, would prevent many older folk, who qualified from applying for what had been an automatic entitlement, he said: Many will be confused and fearful about the change. They are being hassled unnecessarily and that, in itself, is a crime by the State they have served so well, for so long. They have each earned many times over the right to be well looked after, with a minimum of worry in their twilight years. The medical card has acted as a great comfort of those older citizens. The supreme irony is that the net gain to the State, after the administration cost is deducted, will be marginal, at best. It was a further stealth tax being added to the many others that old age pensioners on fixed incomes have to face, he added, before going on to quote the great 19th century leader Daniel O’Connell, who said, 'Nothing is politically right that is morally wrong, and this is morally wrong'. That sums it all up as regards the medical card system. As regards the education aspect, I have a letter from a national school in relation to its third and fourth classes. It is easy to read and very specific in saying: [36]We are not happy at the decisions made by the Minster for Finance in last week’s budget. We are not happy, because it will be harder to learn, with more children in the classrooms. This will affect lots of children’s education. This will affect our play. If there are too many children, it will become a danger during playtime in the yard. It will be difficult for teachers to look after every child. It will be difficult for other teachers if other classes must be split up to join them because it was decided we cannot have substitute teachers. The money for children who might need special resources to help them learn has also been taken away. This is not fair, These resources are to help us to learn. It has been decided to take away some of the money for schools to buy equipment also. This is really not fair. It is really unfair that you have decided to take away teachers that help non-national children who need help to learn English for school. You have taken away jobs from teachers that have done a lot of work to learn to teach. Why do you need to take away some of the money that all the schools need. We are very concerned about this. We would like a reply about this situation. Those two letters are very relevant in the current climate. The senior citizen is worried beyond belief. As that man rightly said, nothing is politically right that is morally wrong. The same is said by a class of three and four year olds. The Labour Party will continue to fight tooth and nail to ensure those least well-off in society, such as those on rent subsidy, senior citizens and those in schools, are not left behind and forgotten by the Government.",23/10/2008,30,864,865,budget aimed to protect those who were most vulnerable Surely there are some within Fianna Fáil and especially in the,Green Party,as well as the two Independents who support the Government who see this proposal for those in rented accommodation is,Green Party,3907216_7,,budget aimed to protect those who were most vulnerable Surely there are some within Fianna Fáil and especially in the Green Party as well as the two Independents who support the Government who see this proposal for those in rented accommodation is,budget aimed to protect those who were most vulnerable Surely there are some within Fianna Fáil and especially in the as well as the two Independents who support the Government who see this proposal for those in rented accommodation is,text778,1,4,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.201464153,0.005036604,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.75975976,0.704704705,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2171108,491,8,88,EC Council Meeting: Statements.,06/12/1984,Mr. Charles J. Haughey,Fianna Fáil,Dublin North-East,"We on this side of the House welcome the modest achievement of the European Council in resolving the wine issue which, however, is apparently subject to the Greek reservation. We are also glad for the country's sake that this progress has done something to get back some credibility to what was becoming a very discredited Irish Presidency. The conclusions issued after the summit do not contain any reference to enlargement, to wine or to fisheries. Indeed, in a formal sense there were no decisions on these matters. Due to the Greek reservation — and latest press reports seem to indicate that the whole position in that regard is still very dubious — there is inevitably a question mark over whether the 1986 target date for accession by Spain and Portugal can still be achieved. If, however, the measure of [1842] agreement reached in the Dublin European Council helps to facilitate the conslusion of the enlargement negotiations that is, of course, welcome. At the same time there is no cause for any particular elation. A European summit only happens in Dublin once every five years. This meeting was almost wholly taken up with the problem of wine and the special difficulties of Greece, neither of which is of any particular interest to Ireland. We have every right to be disappointed that a Dublin European Summit did not focus its attention on the problems that are real and urgent and which arise from the critical and disastrous state of the Irish economy. Wine lakes have very little meaning for the unemployed in Ballyfermot, nor could the Irish farmer find reassurance in all the carefully manicured reports put out by the unfailing, unflagging press relations Government machine. Nothing is simpler for us than to win easy laurels as good Europeans at our own expense. I think now after 12 years of Community membership we should have been alert to the great opportunity the summit in Dublin could offer. Clearly we were not. Another summit has come and gone without any major improvement in our situation. Before the European Council meeting there were many opinions expressed that the wine problem could have been solved beforehand with a bit more care and attention. The Sunday Times, for example, on 2 December stated that 'the Ten came within an ace of a solution' ten days ago when the Italian Foreign Minister Andreotti made an offer that shifted the Italian position. 'Barry' the paper says 'failed to understand that he had a breakthrough'. The main focus of this Council should have been on the appalling level of unemployment in Ireland and throughout the Community. In the European Parliament on 25 July 1984 the Taoiseach admitted that unemployment is the principal preoccupation of people in all the countries of the EC. He said: 'It is a truism, but one which [1843] to a remarkable degree our Governments have hitherto succeeded in ignoring that joint concerted action, taken together... could provide a stimulus for growth far greater than anything that is within the capacity of any single member state, even one of the larger member states, acting on its own.' I quote that with full approval. I have always advanced the case for concerted Community action. I always pressed this case as Taoiseach at European summits. It seems to me axiomatic that the Community, acting together with a combined policy and programme, could achieve a solution that would certainly escape their efforts as individual member states. The peoples of Europe might reasonably have expected some urgent programme of action to be initiated by this summit, some emergency pooling of resources to defeat the major social evil confronting Europe today, but nothing of the kind emerged. Once again, unfortunately, it was the British Prime Minister, just as in the Brussels summit last March and the Chequers summit of two weeks ago, who brusquely rejected the Irish view. Let me quote from Tuesday's London Times:'She [the British Prime Minister] was unimpressed by an appeal from Dr. FitzGerald for a common reflation. `National economies had to be put right nationally' she said: `and the Community could help by opening national borders, harmonising standards and integrating new technology.' 'It was a clear rejection of any Community approval to the massive problem of mass unemployment. While on the subject of unemployment, the Taoiseach and the European Council had in front of them copies of the Annual Economic Report and Review by the EEC Commission. These documents deserved careful study. The report suggests that 'priority be given to public expenditure programmes that contribute efficiently to restoring the productive potential of the economy'. This is exactly what we have been saying. It points out that 'in the search for budgetary economies, cuts in public investment have in [1844] many countries been severely depressing the construction industry'. This is absolutely apropos in our circumstances. The Government's industrial policy is also criticised in the document for excessive capital deepening at the expense of labour. The EC Commission are not greatly impressed by the Government's progress towards balancing the current budget, and implicitly critical of the document Building on Reality and its assumptions. They warn that 'developments in government consumption and other payments over the period may be less favourable than now anticipated.' While the criticisms in the report are diplomatically worded, the clear message is that the Commission does not endorse the Irish Government's economic policy. This Irish Presidency has not, unfortunately, been a particularly good time for Irish interests in the Community. Our position has been adversely affected in a number of ways. There has been a second major capitulation this year to British and German pressure on the Common Agricultural Policy. The first was the introduction of the superlevy whose effects have yet to be fully felt and understood. The second capitulation is now the agreement that agricultural spending will grow less fast than the growth in own resources. This will have far-reaching and longterm damaging effects on our economy agreement and will permanently condemn Irish farmers to declining real incomes. The Minister for Finance played a leading role in this, along with the British and German Ministers, at a meeting in Dromoland Castle in September. It is no excuse to say that British and German pressure was too great to resist. The Taoiseach has attempted to shift the blame for this situation on to Irish farmers in a scandalous speech recently. We in Fianna Fáil reject the criticism he levelled at farmers on that occasion. It was intemperate, inaccurate and unfair. It is, of course, much easier to attack Irish farmers at home than to protect them in Europe. I do not have any documentation on the subject of fisheries but one must be very suspicious of the wall of silence that [1845] surrounds this issue. It would appear from reports from the summit that the Community leaders agreed on a common position for the negotiations on enlagements in relation to fisheries to proceed somewhat along the following lines. There will be a 'ten' -year — I put that in inverted commas — transition period after Spanish entry on 1 January 1986 during which Spanish trawlers will be obliged to observe the present arrangements, that is Spanish vessels would fish outside the Irish 50 miles box. But, of course, as the Minister for Fisheries admitted in the Dáil on Tuesday the stance now adopted will very likely change through further negotiations. It is obvious that this inadequate ten year transitional period is the Community's opening stance in the negotiations and will be most likely watered down with disastrous consequences for Irish fishermen. The original demand for transition was 20 years. This has now been reduced to 10 years and may end up in further talks being reduced to something totally useless. Spanish Government sources have already rejected even the ten-year transition period and are demanding a phased transitional period, an increased share of fish stocks and added access to the west of Ireland fisheries including rights inside the six to 12 mile zone. Spain has a fishing fleet larger than the rest of the Community put together and will obtain free access to Irish waters, subject in theory only to the Common Fisheries Policy and certain restrictions in coastal waters up to 12 miles offshore. I believe that it is necessary for someone to sound the alarm. We are on the verge of having a major blow inflicted to our national position. It is all too easy to settle for a transition period. It puts off the evil day and those responsible are probably hoping not to be there to accept the blame when the day of reckoning comes. Let it be fully understood throughout the Irish community that when that day comes a vast fleet of Spanish boats will have almost unlimited access to our fishing grounds. It will come quickly and the effective policing of our [1846] waters under the Common Fisheries Policy will be virtually impossible. Still speaking of enlargement, we cannot ignore the Greek demand for a £3½ billion scheme of support for the Mediterranean as the price of Spanish and Portuguese entry. While Greek claims may have been dismissed by various heads of Government, it is not clear how they intend to resolve this matter. Did the Irish Government even consider some similar claim by us for greater regional aid in the context of enlargement. Have we once again been cowed, subservient and afraid to seek what is fair and reasonable? It always used to be the position of the Irish Government that we would not allow the less developed countries of the Community to become separated by a prosperity divide. The Government should not accept the granting of any further one-sided Mediterranean proposals unless they are distributed equitably among all the least developed regions of the Community. The Irish Government must adopt a tough negotiation position on this point. This is vital because it would be intolerable if our undue proportion of the permitted increase in own resources were to be pre-empted by the Mediterranean countries. Here let me ask the House for a moment to consider this whole question of the increase in own resources. It is stipulated to be 1. 4 per cent. We are going to go through all the trauma of putting that proposal through the parliaments of the Ten — a major political undertaking. Already it is becoming clear that 1. 4 per cent is going to become very quickly inadequate. It is certainly going to become inadequate very quickly after enlargement. I am told that calculations indicate that already the existing Ten will be up to 1. 2 per cent to meet their current obligations. That apparently leaves 0. 2 per cent of own resources to cope with all the new demands which enlargement will bring. I seriously suggest that that whole situation should be reviewed and reconsidered and that the Community and the ten parliaments should not be put through this whole laborious process of [1847] increasing own resources to 1. 4 per cent which it appears is going to be inadequate before it ever comes into operation. That is something that this summit should have looked at and faced up to. Certainly, in so far as we are concerned, we have this vital interest in the agricultural funds, the Regional Fund and the Social Fund. So far as we are concerned, this 1. 4 per cent is already looming up as a very threatening limiting restriction on any advance in those areas. If some Governments are stipulating that Spanish and Portuguese admission is their price for an increase of own resources, then at least we should make sure that the increase in own resources is adequate to cope with what they are demanding as their price for such increase. I naturally welcome the decision of the Council in respect of aid to Ethiopia and other famine-struck countries. I think we can all be proud of role Ireland has played in prodding the conscience of the Community on this point. If we look back over the record of this House, the Fianna Fáil Party will be seen to have played their part in persuading the Government both to act nationally and to bring this matter forcibly to the attention of our partners. There is no sense in which we can claim to live in a civilised world, when millions are permanently undernourished and hundreds of thousands starve and die of hunger. The European Council effectively deferred consideration of what is known as the Dooge or Spaak 11 interim report on the institutional future of Europe until the summit in Rome next June. In view of the serious implications involved in this report, I want to suggest that, there must be a full debate here in this Dáil on this report prior to that meeting. We face a situation today where certain political forces in Europe, with the Taoiseach's Christian Democratic friends in the vanguard, are seeking to force the pace of European union, especially political union. On the face of it, this is seeking to counteract the threatened loss of cohesion in the Community that will result [1848] from further enlargement from Ten to Twelve, a final attempt, as it were, before 1986 to push towards the goals of the founders of the Community. Ireland's principal reservation to date must be a scepticism as to how a political union can exist without a full economic union to underpin it. There are plenty of examples around the world in the last 30 years which demonstrate that political unions between different sovereign states are of no significance without an economic basis. Unfortunately, I detect no political will at present to increase the resources of the Community beyond the bare, minimum necessity reflecting — and I have to say again — the narrow, rigid British view that national economic problems must be solved nationally. If that is to be the position I have doubts as to whether it is wise to embark on a process that will raise hopes in some quarters and fears in others, but which in my view is bound to end in collapse. We in Ireland have always been in favour of genuine economic and social integration. When I say genuine, I mean a concept of integration that will involve a fair redistribution of resources throughout the Community whereby people in Ireland can aspire to similar living standards as enjoyed elsewhere in Europe. If on the other hand integration simply means a further concentration of economic activity in the centre of the Community stretching from south-east England through Northern France, Benelux and the Ruhr, while the periphery becomes steadily more impoverished, then that is not acceptable to us. Unless the redistributive element, which if anything is being cut back at the present time, is to be greatly strengthened, then it may not be in keeping with the real spirit of the Community's political and economic decision-making centre. Community solidarity, in the economic and social sense, is fairly limited at the present time. While I would not wish to deny the useful role that the Community plays in helping us to cope with youth [1849] unemployment, infrastructural development and, to some extent, farm income maintenance, there is no disguising the fact that in dealing with the full impact of the economic crisis at the present time we are largely on our own. The decision-making procedures of the Community are clearly cumbersome and frustrating. But at the same time, if the tendency is going to be to ignore and ride roughshod over the interests of a small country such as ourselves, then the unanimity requirement on vitally important issues is an ultimate fall-back protection which we should not lightly abandon, however rarely we might in practice wish to avail of it. These essentially economic questions are vital and important to us and should not be obscured by the more emotive questions of defence and security, which, of course, inevitably capture public attention. Twenty years ago, partly under the influence of Charles de Gaulle, there was a vision of a Community, separate both from the United States and from the Soviet Union, which would be a totally independent force and a force for good in the world. In reality the Community has developed in a very different way. Progress towards economic and monetary union has faltered and come to a halt. There is no real sense of social solidarity between the peoples of the different member states. There has been an attempt to push political union out in front, not with the objective of an independent Europe at all but a Europe that would be defence oriented. If Europe is not to be an independent entity in world affairs then we Irish would be better to retain our own independent voice as the most constructive contribution we can make to world peace and stability. It is not enough to say that we would have reservations about the military aspects of European union. I think we should argue positively in Community terms that the Community's strength and respect in the world derives to a considerable extent from the fact that it is not viewed as a military entity or bloc. We must argue that there [1850] are other fora in which those European countries who wish to talk about defence can concert their positions. Senator Dooge's reservations extend only, as far as one can see, to strictly military proposals. But there is also the position in regard to the concept of a common foreign policy. We fully support the principle of European political co-operation which, while it seeks maximum consensus and consultation, is not a legally binding process under any formal treaty. We inevitably approach some world questions from a different point of view to most of our partners, for whom strategic considerations are often paramount. There will have to be a debate on the important choices we could be facing by the second half of 1985. That debate will have to concentrate equally on both the economic aspects and the political aspects of the European union proposals. I now come to Anglo-Irish relations. The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister met for one-quarter of an hour, probably less. We all know what that means. It means they could not possibly have gone into any matter seriously or in depth. It is pathetic, indeed insulting, to our intelligence to see the crude attempts being made to build this into something significant. There is the specious claim that Anglo-Irish relations are back on the rails and that all is once more sweetness and light. Let me give a quotation from the Minister for Justice, Deputy Michael Noonan, he of Béal na Bláth fame: I am also sustained by the progress which the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister recently made and which was reconfirmed yesterday, progress which I believe will be seen to be of far greater importance than the difficulties created by insensitive remarks by British leaders and foolish triumphalism of Unionist politicians. It is nothing short of fraud for the Taoiseach, his Ministers and his advisers to attempt to claim that Anglo-Irish relations are back on the rails and that all is once more sweetness and light. Of course [1851] according to the Taoiseach and his Ministers, Deputies Barry and Noonan they never went off the rails anyway, there was just the unfortunate PR aspect of the Taoiseach being humiliated in public by the British Prime Minister. Nothing proves more convincingly the superficiality of this Government's policies that they so substitute the shadow for the substance. All that was wrong with the abolition of food subsidies was the presentation. All that was wrong with the Chequers summit was its unfortunate presentation afterwards. Let everyone be clear on the simple basic fact that the British Prime Minister retracted nothing yesterday. Indeed, according to the Irish Independent on 5 December 1984, she said: 'I cannot say that I would have reacted any differently now'. If we were in any doubt about any possible softening of the British position, we have only to look at the British Secretary of State for the North's remarks to the Assembly the day before yesterday, when he made it clear that his policy was to pursue the 1982 internal initiative of his predecessor. The Taoiseach and Government Ministers in every statement they have made, both in the communiqué following the Chequers summit, and in defence of it at the press conference and subsequently, have subverted the whole ethos of the Forum report and the basic principle of that report that no solution can be found within a Northern Ireland context. The Forum report was about creating lasting peace and stability in a new Ireland. The present Anglo-Irish concentration is on how to present Northern Ireland to the world in a more palatable and acceptable light if that is possible. The SDLP, in their statement last weekend, have again spelt out clearly their rejection of any internal settlement. Their statement reaffirms the party's commitment to political means and to dialogue and states that the Forum report remains the basis of the SDLP's position. They call on the Irish Government and I quote: 'to reflect the depth of anger and [1852] concern created by the British Prime Minister'.",06/12/1984,24,2017,2018,prodding the conscience of the Community on this point If we look back over the record of this House the,Fianna Fáil,Party will be seen to have played their part in persuading the Government both to act nationally and to bring,Fianna Fáil,2171108_2,,prodding the conscience of the Community on this point If we look back over the record of this House the Fianna Fáil Party will be seen to have played their part in persuading the Government both to act nationally and to bring,prodding the conscience of the Community on this point If we look back over the record of this House the Party will be seen to have played their part in persuading the Government both to act nationally and to bring,text307,0,1,0,0,40,0.025,1,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.015811388,0.000395285,0.577577578,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.445445445,0.44044044,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2810763,821,9,131,Adjournment Debate. - Flood Damage.,24/01/1996,Mr. Michael Noonan,Fine Gael,Limerick East,"I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney. I have listened with great interest to what the Deputies have said about the problems caused by the recent flooding in the south east. The picture they describe is very familiar to me and I am sure to people in many parts of the south and south east which experienced adverse weather conditions recently. These conditions comprised exceptionally heavy and prolonged rainfall over the period from approximately 29 December 1995 to 14 January 1996. This led to high, and in some areas unprecedented, water levels in rivers which, combined with high winds and raised tide levels due to a severe low pressure system centred in the area, caused flooding and damage in a number of locations. I pay tribute to the work of the various local services in responding to the flooding. The immediate responsibility to take [1202] steps to try to prevent or limit the flooding and, where that proves to be impossible, to deal with the effects of flooding, falls primarily on local authorities. They have the local organisation and personnel to deal with such situations in the most effective way, assisted where necessary by other agencies. There is a major emergency plan for each local authority area which defines the role of the local authorities, the Garda and health boards in the event of major emergencies. While the major emergency plan does not normally need to be activated in the case of flooding incidents, its provisions generally guide the activities of the various agencies and ensure an orderly and effective response. The local authority staff, local Garda, fire services and Civil Defence personnel all responded magnificently to the emergency, as did many private individuals who willingly came to the assistance of their neighbours. On behalf of the Government, I express appreciation of the efforts of all concerned. The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, has been aware both in general and specific terms from reports received from around the affected areas of the extent of the hardship caused to families by the flooding of homes throughout the south and south east, including County Wexford where, I understand, a substantial number of houses suffered flooding and from personal experience following his visits to Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary last week. These two areas were particularly badly affected. The Minister of State is also aware from preliminary reports, provided at his request by the local authorities to the Department of the Environment, of the nature and extent of the flooding and the resultant hardship in Counties Cork, Kilkenny and Waterford. The Government is likewise conscious of the traumatising effect such flooding can [1203] have on individuals, particularly the elderly, and cannot but sympathise with the plight of the flood victims. While the Government cannot accept the principle that it has an obligation to meet requests for payment in full for losses, it recognises that individuals may require assistance from time to time to get them over very adverse situations and acknowledges their need to be treated on a humanitarian basis, particularly where they are under insured and in poor financial circumstances. In that context, the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, brought the problem of the serious hardship caused in parts of Ireland due to the exceptional flooding to the attention of the EU by means of a submission. This included a folder of press cuttings and photographs from national and local newspapers and video footage from RTE which gave a clear indication of the extent of the disaster and the resulting hardship. Incidentally, this contained specific references to the flooding and other damage in the Wexford and south Tipperary areas. This was followed up by a personal visit by the Minister and officials of the Office of Public Works to Brussels where they met Mr. David Williamson, Secretary General of the EU Commission on Monday, 22 January. I am pleased to say that Mr. Williamson responded to the Minister's request and indicated he would propose to the Commission that aid be provided to Ireland and Portugal, which also suffered severe flooding. I understand that this proposal was put to and approved by the Commission today. A request will now be made to the EU Council and Parliament to provide the necessary funding, which was not previously provided in the 1996 EU budget. This will involve a transfer of funds from other allocations and it is a matter on which the Parliament must decide. This process, I am advised, is likely to take between 40 and 60 days. Consideration will be given to further [1204] humanitarian assistance from the Exchequer in the light of any provision provided from the European Union. However, it must be emphasised that any assistance from the Exchequer will necessarily be limited and the cost will have to be met from existing budget provisions. It is customary when the EU provides humanitarian assistance in such circumstances that the funds are channelled through the national Red Cross Society of the member state, in this case the Irish Red Cross Society. The Irish Red Cross Society, which has considerable professional experience in dealing compassionately, impartially and effectively with the disbursement of such humanitarian funds, fully supports the Government's application to the EU Commission for humanitarian assistance and stands ready to administer any funds which might be made available from EU or Exchequer sources. In the circumstances, as it may be some time yet before any funds might come on stream, the Irish Red Cross Society, with whom we have been in contact, advises that householders and others who have suffered damage as a result of flooding and intend to submit applications for humanitarian assistance, should ensure that they have sufficient evidence, photographic or otherwise, and adequate records of damages, cost estimates, etc., for examination by the society. I acknowledge the strong and united support of all Oireachtas Members, particularly from Tipperary South and Wexford, as well as the assistance of our MEPs in Brussels in furthering our case for humanitarian aid.",24/01/1996,27,531,532,humanitarian basis particularly where they are under insured and in poor financial circumstances In that context the Minister of State,Deputy Coveney,brought the problem of the serious hardship caused in parts of Ireland due to the exceptional flooding to the attention,Deputy Coveney,2810763_3,,humanitarian basis particularly where they are under insured and in poor financial circumstances In that context the Minister of State Deputy Coveney brought the problem of the serious hardship caused in parts of Ireland due to the exceptional flooding to the attention,humanitarian basis particularly where they are under insured and in poor financial circumstances In that context the Minister of State brought the problem of the serious hardship caused in parts of Ireland due to the exceptional flooding to the attention,text579,4,2,0,0,40,-0.05,-2,-0.587786665,-0.014694667,-0.007905694,-0.000197642,0.068068068,0.037037037,0.181181181,0.193193193,0.319319319,0.319319319,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2645408,158,9,26,Aer Lingus Difficulties: Statements.,12/03/1993,Mr. Donal Carey,Fine Gael,Clare,"I support my colleague, [1983] Deputy Owen, in asking the Minister if the Government has the will to solve this problem. The evidence to date appears that it does not. The appointment of Mr. Cahill has the appearance of a post receivership. Bernie Cahill has admitted on television that he is a businessman. Surely the Department and the Minister — although he has only been recently appointed — should realise that a person needs special training to deal with transport problems? When the management team was being set up to draw up a viable business plan for Aer Lingus more was required than the appointment of a man whose collective wisdom had already been rejected by the Government. What direction is the Government taking at present? I share the concerns of other Deputies in regard to the Government's approach to this matter. The Minister should examine the possibility of appointing others to assist Mr. Cahill in drawing up a viable business plan for Aer Lingus. There are approximately 800 Aer Lingus employees in my constituency in Shannon. It appears that Shannon is used as a scapegoat for the difficulties of Aer Lingus and the Government from time to time and this has been highlighed by the staff of Aer Lingus and various spokespersons. There is a further selective leak of the report of the Boston consultancy group in todays Irish Times. The report has not been published yet. If the Minister wants to be fair to the public he should have got a copy of that report and not a summary from the directors of Aer Lingus. The problems in Aer Lingus did not arise today or yesterday. As far back as 1987 we knew there would be deregulation and that a liberalisation policy would be adopted. It is regrettable that the Minister has inherited all these problems, but the previous Ministers stood back and watched this paralysis take place. Aer Lingus management and officials sought assurances that equity would be put into the company and the Government played politics with that. It is despicable, as Deputy Owen said, that [1984] 7,000 or 8,000 jobs in our national airline are at risk because of a flagrant refusal to face reality. Even at this stage, the Government is on a merry-go-round and refuses to face up to the difficulties in Aer Lingus. Deputy Burke stated that the Government should be partners in the plan, but it has a director on the Aer Lingus board. What is he doing on that board? Did he or the Minister not examine the annual reports of the company? The company's interest repayments have increased from £5 million approximately four years ago to a present figure of £40 million. Was the Minister not concerned at that increase? What action was taken? There is no evidence that any action was taken. The Government met its target and a dividend was paid when it was making plans for the future. This was to meet the political requirements of the then Fianna Fáil and subsequent Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Governments, which did not show much concern for the future of the workers in Aer Lingus. The ancillary affairs of Aer Lingus have been profitable. Would the Government not consider reappointing Mr. Hanrahan who was in charge of the ancillaries? Would he not be able to give good advice on this matter? Should he not be appointed to assist Mr. Cahill? Mr. Kennedy was available to give advice in regard to hospitals, a man with vast experience in the transport industry. He was able to give advice in regard to the Tallaght hospital, but he is not available now when Aer Lingus is in a crisis. The Minister must use his undoubted imagination to draw up a realistic plan. Commentators have challenged the political scene. James Downey's article, entitled 'Flights of political fancy', in today's Irish Independent is useful in that it challenges the politicians to be decisive and to use their imagination in regard to the value of this multinational company. Aer Lingus has been a successfully trading multinational company for many years. The politicians must decide the policy conducted by the company and we are making a miserably bad job of that so far. [1985] The crisis in Aer Lingus has been going on since 1986 when Aer Lingus thought the competition on the London route would cease when liberalisation took place. I hope the Minister takes on board some of the suggestions made in this regard. My party supports an equity investment but we would like to see an aviation policy in place. I was glad to hear the Minister assure the House that Mr. Cahill will ensure that the transatlantic leg of Aer Lingus will be part of Government policy for the future.",12/03/1993,27,505,506,was making plans for the future This was to meet the political requirements of the then Fianna Fáil and subsequent,Fianna Fáil,Progressive Democrat Governments which did not show much concern for the future of the workers in Aer Lingus The ancillary,Fianna Fáil,2645408_4,,was making plans for the future This was to meet the political requirements of the then Fianna Fáil and subsequent Fianna Fáil Progressive Democrat Governments which did not show much concern for the future of the workers in Aer Lingus The ancillary,was making plans for the future This was to meet the political requirements of the then Fianna Fáil and subsequent Progressive Democrat Governments which did not show much concern for the future of the workers in Aer Lingus The ancillary,text49,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.057784292,0.001444607,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.508508509,0.494494494,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3893686,2207,9,131,Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill 2008: Second Stage.,30/09/2008,Mr. Kieran O'Donnell,Fine Gael,Limerick East,"Tonight is an historic moment for Ireland. While we discuss this Bill, people are looking on who are fearful of losing their jobs or who cannot secure access to finance for their small businesses. The chief executives of four banks appeared before a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last July. Fine Gael specifically requested their attendance to discuss the issue of the difficulties encountered by people in accessing credit. The witnesses told us there was no problem and that they were continuing to lend money. Clearly, they were not. Those people have seen today that while they could not access credit, the same is not true for the banks in their moment of difficulty. It is extremely important that the measures introduced under this legislation should not only benefit the banks but also small businesses and those who are seeking mortgages. In particular, we should bear in mind two consequences of this proposal. First, the banks are now able to access further liquidity on the interbank market at a lower rate than they were being offered yesterday. They must pass on that lower rate to hard-pressed customers. Second, Government bonds have increased in value in terms of the returns people will expect. That will affect the taxpayer. I am glad the Minister made reference to the guarantee scheme and how he proposes to put the mechanism in place. However, it is important that the taxpayer does not pay the cost of these measures. Under section 6(4), it is proposed that all financial support shall, 'as far as possible', ultimately be recouped from the credit institution or subsidiary to which it was provided. It is important that we devise mechanisms whereby the taxpayer does not pay for these provisions. We will bring forward proposals to that effect on Committee Stage. The Minister made reference to the buffer made up of equity and other risks. However, he made no reference to potential bad debts that the banks must write off, to ensuring they do not pay a dividend and that there will be an end to the awarding of excessive bonuses to chief executive officers, and that they do not engage in risky practices. [46]We are operating in changed circumstances and there is a requirement for new regulatory measures. Deputy Kenny referred to the Government making appointments to risk management committees within the banks. In addition, an overseas board should be appointed by the Government which would include the Financial Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank.",30/09/2008,30,57,58,executives of four banks appeared before a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last July,Fine Gael,specifically requested their attendance to discuss the issue of the difficulties encountered by people in accessing credit The witnesses told,Fine Gael,3893686_1,,executives of four banks appeared before a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last July Fine Gael specifically requested their attendance to discuss the issue of the difficulties encountered by people in accessing credit The witnesses told,executives of four banks appeared before a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last July specifically requested their attendance to discuss the issue of the difficulties encountered by people in accessing credit The witnesses told,text54,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.110679718,-0.002766993,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.201201201,0.223223223,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3207121,693,8,43,"Order of Business. - Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2000 [ Seanad ] : Report and Final Stages.",16/05/2001,Mr. Micheál Martin,Fianna Fáil,Cork South-Central,"Yes, we have issued that. Generally speaking I welcome the broad support for the measure from all Deputies in the House. There has been some carping and some criticism and so on but I take it from the comments that everybody is agreed that over 70s should have a medical card. It is an important statement to come from the Oireachtas. I know others want it all done now but it is not possible to do it all now. Last year we received a record increase in funding from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and an extra £1 billion this year which is being used right across the board. People have to realise that health care is not just about the acute hospital system. This Government had a programme for the health and social services which it has delivered in terms of commitments, targets and spending on a variety of reform programmes. To take only intellectual disability and the physical and sensory disability area, any fair minded person in the House would have to acknowledge that my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, together brought in a major change in terms of the level of funding given to people with intellectual disability. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in respite places for the intellectually disabled, day care places and long-term residential places. More remains to be done but that fundamental [566] improvement has to be acknowledged. In addition, the physical and sensory disabilities area have also benefited significantly but could benefit more and when the national database is in place we will be in a position to meet those needs properly. One can compare the budgets of 1996 or 1997 with what happened subsequently. I do not buy the excuse that suddenly from one budget to another the country was awash with money. We were certainly better off. However, there were too many areas that had long been neglected from mental health and access to psychiatric help and so on right across the board. I do not think any party here would make the contribution Deputy McManus made in terms of condemning the Fianna Fáil party or this Government on its record on health. We know there are difficulties out there but we also know that since coming to office and under the stewardship of Deputy Cowen, as Minister, and particularly under the overall stewardship of Deputy McCreevy, we have released significant resources far greater than anything before in a structured and strategic way to improve mental health, services for the disabled, social services, child care, services for homeless people and so on. We inherited a legacy where there was extremely poor infrastructure and we have invested heavily in acute hospital care. There are far more consultants in place in cancer and cardiovascular units than there were in 1997. Far more people are being treated now than in 1997. Between 1997 and today, more than 82,000 extra people have been treated in our hospitals. That has increased volume of activity and increased pressure on the system. Historic issues are converging and are creating pressures on the system. Clearly the historic under investment in health over a 20 year period, prior to 1997, is a key factor as are the demographic changes in terms of the elderly and the population getting older and the basic increase in demand deriving from improvements in medical science and technology. The Government is conscious of its improvement. Deputy McManus asked why there should be a health strategy now. Surely we have reached a stage of maturity in this House where not every Government feels it must have a new strategy as soon as it is elected, although certainly there can be new programmes. There should be a consistent, agreed strategic framework that governs the evolution of the health care system, that involves not only the political parties but more importantly the partners who deliver the health service on the ground. Over the past 30 years the average length of Government has been three-and-a-half years. Are people saying a new strategy should be invented every time a new composition of Government comes in to office? I do not think that makes any sense. The last strategy was seven years ago, we are now moving— [567]Acting Chairman: Sorry to cut across the Minister. In fairness I am expected to keep Members on line. The Minister is way off the subject of those over 70 getting a medical card.

892141,241,9,94,Committee on Finance. - Motion by the Minister for Finance (Resumed).,09/03/1955,Mr. John Aloysius Costello,Fine Gael,Dublin Townships,"We are determined to do that not by cutting salaries but by economies in the use of staff. We are fully aware that those economies will be hard to achieve. Achievement will be slow and arduous and may indeed involve some new thinking about our existing financial and administrative techniques. Those are some of the difficulties with which we are confronted. They are small compared to the difficulties we had to face because of the policy that had been in operation from 1951 to 1954 when the country got rid of the Fianna Fáil Government. The 1952 Budget, as Deputy Bartley rightly said, is still with us. I have said how difficult it is to get economy in the public service. We had the slashing of the food subsidies in 1952, the deliberate policy adopted by the Government at that time because of their philosophy that the country was too well off and was living beyond its means, because incomes generally, as the then Minister for Finance said in his Budget speech, had gone beyond the cost of living. Therefore, incomes had to be cut down and the cost of living had to be deliberately allowed to rise as it did rise by 15 points over that period of three years during which they were in office. That philosophy brought about the conditions from which this country suffered in the last three years and from the effects of which the country is still suffering and which we have not yet got completely rid of — unemployment, depression in trade, a steep rise in the cost of living bringing about [222] demands for increased wages which could not be pressed home — as they could have been and would have been in different circumstances — because of the fear of unemployment that was ever present in the mind of those people who were asking for more wages to enable them to keep up with the cost of living. Deliberate Government policy brought about unemployment, a depression in trade, a depression in money, a fall in the purchasing value of the £. Panic measures were taken in 1953 by the Government to try and alleviate the unemployment which was brought about by the adoption of their financial policy, panic measures resulting in public money being poured out without any regard to whether or not any productive results were obtained from it. Public bodies were told: 'Get on with schemes which will do something for unemployment. Do not wait for sanction. Do something, for heaven's sake'. That was brought about by the policy deliberately adopted by the Government, and when I referred to that we were warned off. Civil servants' salaries were increased, and other salaries, and the cost of Government services were increased, because of the fall in the purchasing power of the £ brought about by that policy and because of the other conditions brought about by that policy. I referred to this matter on previous occasions. While I do not think that I have the gift of prophecy that Deputy Lemass assumed to himself during the recent Supplies and Services debate, and at frequent intervals in this House, speaking on the Vote on Account for the financial year 1953-54 on the 12th March, 1953, in column 254, Volume 137, having referred to the evil effects which were then abundantly apparent from the policy of the Government in the measures put into operation so unjustly and so unnecessarily by the Budget of 1952, I put this rhetorical question: 'What has been the cost of this to the commuunity?' I answered that by saying:— [223]'It is incalculable, perhaps it is irreparable. If it is not irreparable, it certainly will remain as an injury to the economic fabric of the State for very many years after the present Government have ceased to be the Government. The position has almost become frozen. Any Government that succeeds the present Government will have a task of appalling difficulty to contend with.' Every word of it was true. Now that we are the Government we have found how true it was. We have realised, even more than we had at that time when I was speaking, what an appalling task a Government succeeding that Government would have to deal with. Now, in spite of those difficulties we have, by subsidy, reduced the price of butter at a cost of over £2,000,000, and have reduced the face of the Book of Estimates by over £2,750,000. That is no small achievement. In the course of the debate on Supplies and Services — I think in the course of the remarks made by Deputy de Valera — reference was made to those promises which we never made and the non-fulfilment of undertakings which we never gave. It was stated that I had, in some way, retracted my position by the speech I had made on behalf of the Government when I was speaking on prices, particularly those prices which rise because of economic forces outside this country, over which we have no control. I am told that that was something new which we never stated until we took over Government. I said it a long time ago in extenuation of Fianna Fáil policy.",09/03/1955,15,100,101,in operation from 1951 to 1954 when the country got rid of the Fianna Fáil Government The 1952 Budget as,Deputy Bartley,rightly said is still with us I have said how difficult it is to get economy in the public service,Deputy Bartley,892141_2,,in operation from 1951 to 1954 when the country got rid of the Fianna Fáil Government The 1952 Budget as Deputy Bartley rightly said is still with us I have said how difficult it is to get economy in the public service,in operation from 1951 to 1954 when the country got rid of the Fianna Fáil Government The 1952 Budget as rightly said is still with us I have said how difficult it is to get economy in the public service,text698,1,1,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.081110711,-0.002027768,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.227227227,0.24024024,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1753104,272,14,88,"Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1975 [Seanad]: Committee Stage (Resumed).",04/05/1976,Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien,The Labour Party,Dublin North-East,"Deputy Lalor made a number of interesting remarks beginning with the final paragraph of subsection (1). The objectives of subsection (1) are to give statutory backing to the existing practice in RTE in regard to interpretation of the provisions regarding objectivity and impartiality. It is not always possible to cover all significant views in a single programme and RTE regard these provisions as being complied with if all such views are covered in two or more related programmes broadcast over a reasonable period. This is a sensible interpretation, and it has been incorporated in the Bill for the sake of clarity. Deputy Lalor cited a direction of the former director general, Mr. Hardiman, of 8th May, 1970. He pointed out that this might have been in contravention of the old section 18 (1). I do not accept that it was in contravention, but it might have been considered to be in contravention. I am introducing this so that the law shall be specific on this and also so that people who do not think that this is right will have an opportunity and have had an opportunity of contesting it. They can say: 'This is not the right way, it would be better to maintain the strict reading of the existing legislation.' Deputy Lalor expressed himself as worried as to what powers director generals might take in relation to these matters, if we are now effectively ratifying in our legislation an interpretation of a former director general and also of the present director general and Authority. It would be wrong simply automatically to rubber stamp any interpretation of any director general. We ought to be vigilant as to whether we should ratify such interpretations as they occur. We are right to question it and debate it. I propose that it should be ratified by the House or incorporated in the legislation, not because it was a decision or a house rule, but because it was a house rule which is [567] reasonable and fair and that the law should give expression to it. I accept that it is capable of abuse. A programme can be put on which is highly slanted and on the following night there could be another programme which is supposed to set it off but which does not set it off. There have been programmes in the past to which that objection would apply. I will not go into a discussion on any particular programme but this abuse is not inconceivable. The Authority have a duty to see that the powers vested in them are not abused. There is general agreement on both sides of this House that successive authorities have not abused their powers in this matter. Deputy Lalor made the point not in regard to authorities abusing their powers but in regard to individual broadcasters who from time to time may have done so. They may have and I think some of them did from time to time. It is perhaps inevitable that this should occur to some extent. It is the duty of the Authority to keep these tendencies within bounds and to exercise vigilance here. I think the authorities have discharged that duty. In anticipation of Deputy Lalor's remarks I will outline what I conceive to be the duty of the Minister in this area. How can institutional expression be given to this requirement of impartiality? Can the Authority be left as the final arbiters as to whether they are discharging the duty imposed on them by law of being impartial? I would not think so, on the ground that no one should be judge in his own case. Should the Minister be the final judge as regards impartiality? Again I do not think so, because what could be involved when it is asserted that the Authority have failed to discharge their duty of impartiality, may be a conflict between the Government of the day and RTE, or between a Government Department and RTE, and RTE would sincerely think they were discharging their duty and the Government with equal sincerity would think that they were not. Should we say that the Government's view should prevail in this matter of [568] impartiality? I would think not. That is the reason why I set up as an interim measure, the complaints committee, and why I propose now, the statutory complaints commission. That is not to say that the Minister or the Government should abandon all say in what RTE do. What I have sought to do in this legislation is to confine ministerial intervention in this area of programming to the question of subversion or condoning or encouraging subversive activities tending to undermine the authority of the State. I have sought to limit it there. Deputy Lalor quoted me from memory as saying that there was more than an average number of liberal minds in Montrose. I would not object too much to having said that but it was not what I said. Liberal minds in Montrose would be no bad situation. No doubt there are a good many liberal minds there. However, what I said was in the particular situation we had in 1971-72 in relation to subversion and sympathy with subversion. I expressed the view that there was more sympathy among the media with Sinn Féin ideas than there was in the population as a whole. It was my belief that that was true at the time but I think there is less sympathy now with this kind of propaganda and activities than there was then both in so far as the media and the population generally are concerned. The great majority of us here are glad that that is so. I come now to that part of Deputy Lalor's speech where he discussed the handling by RTE of such subjects as divorce and contraception. In the early part of his remarks he seemed to suggest that I might have encouraged RTE to handle these matters in a certain manner but in the later part of his remarks I am grateful to say that he clarified that and indicated that he did not consider that I had sought to impose on RTE any particular point of view in this area. Of course, that is the case. In this area and in others RTE should endeavour to cover all significant views. I accept entirely that the conservative point of view—I use Deputy Lalor's word—is a significant point of view and should find expression. [569] But I think also that my view and the views of my party are not insignificant and, consequently, should find expression also. On the question of whether RTE have handled these issues rightly or otherwise, we are dealing here with a very highly emotionally charged field in which anyone who holds strong and sincere views is likely to regard any discussion as giving too much weight to the other side. Clearly, Deputy Lalor holds that opinion genuinely in regard to certain programmes broadcast by RTE. There have been complaints in this regard addressed to the complaints committee. Ten complaints have come before the committee to date. By international standards this is a rather high number and I should hesitate to say whether it is a tribute to the vigilance of our people in regard to impartiality. It may be of interest to the House to note the nature of these complaints and the outcome in regard to them. Of the ten complaints, seven were decided in favour of RTE, one was decided against them and two of which I shall say nothing further are still under consideration by the committee. Of the decisions in favour of RTE one was a complaint by the LFM alleging unbalanced coverage arising out of a speech by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in Waterford. Another was a complaint by the same movement regarding unbalanced reporting on another subject another was a complaint by Miss Máire Breathnach in this precise area alleging that on 17th July, 1974, an RTE broadcast in connection with the contraception Bill was one-sided. Another complaint was from the Irish Family League relating to an episode of 'The Riordans' which made reference to contraception. The fifth complaint was from the Natural Family Planning people in relation to a 'Here and Now' programme. The next complaints was one by the IFA regarding a crisis in the cattle trade and the last was a complaint about biased reporting on Portugal during a '7 Days' programme. All of these were decided in favour of RTE and the reasons for the decisions were published. As the House knows, the complaints [570] committee is headed by a distinguished former judge, Mr. Kingsmill Moore. The decision against RTE was in relation to a 'Last House' programme which included an interview on homosexuality. A report from the committee on that case was published in the RTE Guide. This machinery is about the best that one can provide. Deputy Lalor talked about failure to get satisfaction in relation to complaints but I do not think that one can get satisfaction automatically through such channels because at most, a complaints committee may find against him. In relation to two or three of these cases the point of view expressed by Deputy Lalor was genuinely the attitude of the complainants but the committee did not find in their favour. In the other case—the interview on homosexuality—the balance tilted the other way. At any rate, the existence of that machinery is the best safeguard one can provide in this area in that both the broadcasters and the Authority know that the committee and its procedures exist and that, therefore, there is a kind of vigilance in this area which would be sustained and accepted by public opinion generally as being impartial. In the last part of his remarks Deputy Lalor dealt with a matter which, strictly, does not come in here, that is, the question of party political broadcasts and what he regards as the unwillingness of Ministers to participate in these programmes. The decision in so far as there is nonparticipation in that kind of programme is outside the hands of RTE who were quite interested in continuing to broadcast such programmes. On our side it was considered that party political confrontations of this kind were not the most interesting way of discussing current affairs. Undoubtedly, Deputies will regard that as a wrong decision but regardless of what sort of decision it was, it was a decision of the Government rather than of RTE. Certainly, RTE would be prepared to provide the required forum for that type of programme as they are prepared to provide a forum for all kinds of public affairs discussions. I would not accept that in the past or now RTE have been particularly [571] anxious to bring in one side in politics to the exclusion of the other. They bring in people on considerations of what they regard as good broadcasting. I do not think they are partial. I agree with Deputy Lalor that some presenters may go wrong in their presentation, through enthusiasm or otherwise, and may go against the impartiality rule. If they do, it is for the Authority to pull them up. If the Authority are not doing that, the citizens who think that can address themselves to the complaints commission. There is also, of course, this House where RTE can be and are legitimately open to discussion and criticism. The new section which we have discussed at length is not intended as any radical departure from the existing practice which, indeed, in part it embodies more effectively than was previously done. The new departure is essentially the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and we will have an opportunity of discussing that on the next section.",04/05/1976,20,1,2,"",Deputy Lalor,made a number of interesting remarks beginning with the final paragraph of subsection 1 The objectives of subsection 1 are,Deputy Lalor,1753104_1,,Deputy Lalor made a number of interesting remarks beginning with the final paragraph of subsection 1 The objectives of subsection 1 are,made a number of interesting remarks beginning with the final paragraph of subsection 1 The objectives of subsection 1 are,text486,0,1,0,0,20,0.05,1,1.098612289,0.054930614,0.176776695,0.008838835,0.754754755,0.582582583,0.685685686,0.923923924,0.724724725,0.856856857,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1189713,629,8,157,Adjournment of the D&aacute il. - Debate on Government Policy (Resumed).,16/12/1964,Mr. Brian (Snr.) Lenihan,Fianna Fáil,Roscommon,"It is no harm that they should be gone into. Much has been made of the importance of agriculture. While undoubtedly our main reliance for increasing employment and thereby increasing the population must rest on the industrial sector, it is essential from the the point of view of our balance of payments and our export earnings to have a strong agricultural section which may not absorb more in the way of employment but through its own efficiency, through increased mechanisation and by its own up-to-date methods of production, can earn more for our farmers and the State and so provide for increased employment in industry and eventually in agriculture, once the efficiency is stepped up to that degree. In regard to agriculture, we had, I thought, a most hysterical outburst from Deputy Dillon this morning. He mentioned the fact that we had miscalculated in regard to the amount to be expended on the heifer grant scheme. This scheme was, I may say, very destructively criticised up and down the country when introduced but it has proved a tremendous success. Deputy Dillon said there was something amiss in the fact that we calculated on an expenditure of only £400,000 while in fact the expenditure looks like being in the order of £3 million. That is an excellent thing and it is excellent also that the farmers have so responded to this excellent scheme that the Department of Agriculture may have erred on the pessimistic side in estimating the response of farmers to the extent that what was expected to cost £400,000 at [1214] the planning stage is now going to cost £3 million. It is an excellent expenditure and one that has meant an increased amount, not merely for the medium and larger-size farmers but also for the small farmers of the west who rear and breed store cattle that are the foundation of the cattle industry. These are the people who rear the cattle that may be sold afterwards as stores elsewhere and the people who have primarily benefited from the heifer grant scheme. The destructive misrepresentation, from Fine Gael particularly, at the initiation of the scheme was that it would benefit only the medium and larger-size farmers and would not be used at all by small farmers. The plain fact is that we are spending £3 million instead of £400,000 because the small farmers of Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Roscommon and Leitrim, the areas where the store calves are reared, are availing of this grant. It is there the small man is going in for an extra cow and where he is being encouraged to have an extra heifer by reason of the existence of creameries now in the west of Ireland for the first time. He, therefore, has an outlet for milk which encourages him to go into rearing heifers and cows, and, along with the provision he can make for milk, he is in fact also adding to the stock of beef stores for the British market. This development has been so successful that Deputy Dillon's only point against it now is that it has been too successful and he says we miscalculated in some way in regard to it. I hope we similarly miscalculate in respect of every such scheme that is of benefit to our economy. Miscalculations of that kind are to be welcomed, where people make greater use and avail of schemes to a greater degree than is anticipated by those planning for them. The essential point I should like to make here—I have said this before— is that we have much more in common with the Labour Party than with the Fine Gael Party because we in Fianna Fáil have always believed in planning for social justice. So long as I am in politics, I shall always subscribe to [1215] that. I do not think the Fine Gael Party set this target consciously before them. They are essentially a conservative Party working on opportunism and expediency, without any belief in the fundamental importance of social justice. What does social justice mean, it might be asked. I suggest it is the duty of every Government to ensure that every section of the community advances in accordance with every other section. You must provide the framework and the goals for economic achievement, but within that framework and in the achievement of these goals, it is essential to ensure that no section lags behind another section. There is no point in having targets which may result in an overall improvement of the national economy if in the achievement of these targets certain sectors of the community lag behind other sectors. I regard it as a fundamental duty of the Government to ensure that all sectors of the community move forward together. That is why I place very great reliance on the evolution of a national incomes policy.

4177899,2304,22,219,Priority Questions - County Enterprise Boards,29/03/2011,Mr. Peadar Tóibín,Sinn Féin,Meath West,"The CEBs operate as the engine for small business development throughout the State. They operate locally and therefore have a fantastic knowledge of enterprise locally. They also ensure that small businesses around the State can engage easily with expertise, funds and advice. Therefore, they are a very important part of the enterprise development area. We have a situation whereby Fianna Fáil, in the previous Administration, significantly reduced the amount of funding county enterprise boards received at a time when their job was important and jobs were important to the economy. I am not sure I got an answer to my question. My question concerned the future of CEBs because in recent years the previous Minister created an air of confusion and uncertainty with regard to them. People are fearful that the knowledge that has been built up will be dissipated. Will the county enterprise boards exist or will they be subsumed into the local authorities? If they are subsumed into the local authorities, will they become part of what people see as the layers of bureaucracy that may exist in some local authorities? What are the plans for the funding? Will the cuts by Fianna Fáil in the county enterprise board sector be reversed by the new Administration? If they go to local authorities, will it be the case that councillors may have influence over where grant funding can be allocated?

3878518,2018,9,50,Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed).,26/06/2008,Mr. Joe McHugh,Fine Gael,Donegal North-East,"I wish to share time with Deputy Andrew Doyle. I will have 12 minutes and Deputy Doyle eight. I congratulate my parliamentary soccer colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, on his new position. I wish him the best in his role. I have long been an advocate of intervention, especially through youth participation. I welcome many elements in this Bill. The small shopkeepers to whom Deputy Scanlon referred had a major battle on their hands when this Bill was published. They would have had to invest €60,000-€100,000 in building a separate section in shops, as well as putting personnel in this area. Without analysing this measure too critically, one might have thought it would curb young people’s access to drink. When I consulted with the shopkeepers and saw the code of ethics they have, such as ensuring that those who sell drink are over 18, I did not see the merit in the measure. I welcome the fact the Minister has addressed this. We must continue to examine this area. Members have referred to a mandatory identification card system. That is the way to curb the problem, not by putting extra costs on shopkeepers. Coming from a rural constituency, I saw this as another law that would possibly close local shops. That was all it would do, it would not curb the purchase of drink by young people. It was another element of the type of bureaucracy we are introducing that makes it virtually impossible for businesses to survive in rural areas. It has created an urban-rural divide, and I do not refer to the east-west divide, which is too simplistic. The divide is between urban and rural, even in areas that are predominantly rural. People living in the countryside feel they are doing more of their business in urban areas. Those providing essential services in the countryside are finding it ever more difficult to survive, especially with extra bureaucracy coming down the line. As legislators we must critically examine the cultural impact on people living in the countryside. The Government has brought in laws that make it quite impossible for people to continue with their culture in their communities. That is a sad indictment of the type of society we are [925]trying to create. This occurred to me when a shopkeeper told me he could not incur losses of €60,000 and would have to close his shop. When we critically examine the Lisbon treaty referendum we can examine a county like Donegal and specifically Oileán Thoraí where, according to anecdotal evidence, only one person voted 'Yes'. Tory Island is the most peripheral part of Ireland and of Europe. The further one gets from Brussels and Dublin, the higher the 'No' vote. I spoke to the Ceann Comhairle this morning about the high 'No' vote in Kerry. Something negative is happening in rural Ireland and we must become conscious of it. We have driven a wedge between urban and rural areas and the people living in rural areas are not willing to put up with it anymore. An example is the attempt by this Government to remove coastguard services from Valentia, County Kerry and Malin Head. That is another element why people voted 'No' in the referendum. They focused on the local rather than the European picture. Perhaps I have digressed from the Bill. I welcome the fact that off-licences will close at 10. 30 p. m. I passed one at 12. 30 a. m. last Saturday and there was a mighty congregation of young people outside it. The ban on below cost selling promotions is welcome. However, as the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, stated, this is the beginning of the debate. It is unfortunate it did not get going ten years ago. This Bill is scratching the surface of our attempts to change the culture. Deputy Scanlon expressed it succinctly when he said that young people are resilient and will find other ways of getting drink. The major thing we must change is culture. The only way to change any element of culture is by preventative measures and education. No rule or regulation will change the culture of underage drinking. The more rules and restrictions we impose on young people, the more they will step around them. We must get to the core of what is happening in our culture. I welcome the comment by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, that this does not only apply to young people. There is overindulgence and we are all involved. There should be a survey of the 166 Deputies in this House to see what age each started drinking. Perhaps we were all 21. We need a reality check when examining our culture. In the constituency of the Acting Chairman, Deputy O’Connor, there are serious issues with underage drinking. Anecdotally, it seems the age is dropping all the time and young people are getting braver at a younger age. We must examine community responsibility, intertwined with parental responsibility and a pro-active, multi-agency response. I do not refer to producing more reports and policies on what we need to do. We must get engaged at the grassroots level and examine the education sector. Schools should not stop junior and senior infant classes at 1 p. m., nor at 3 p. m. for older classes, nor 4 p. m. for secondary students. School must be ongoing. Students do not pick up bad or deviant behaviour during school hours but during out of school hours. The Minister of State has a role to examine the roll-out of intervention projects. I have confidence he will do so. I received a call from a young person about The LOFT in Letterkenny, which Deputy Blaney knows. It was a productive and useful intervention model, where young people could congregate after school in a non-alcoholic environment. Young people do not necessarily want to engage in drinking. The single biggest attraction for young people, and we are all the same, is to be with their peers and have some banter. That is their main motivation. Those who are good at sport can do it on the Gaelic field or the soccer field and those who are excellent at music meet their peers there. However, the vast majority of young people do not fall into these compartments but they still want to be with each other. I acknowledge the fact the Government funded The LOFT but young people are faced with a predicament. The lease is up in September and the whole project is up in the air. [926]We must realise that we do not need new buildings or to target special, multipurpose centres. The community and enterprise section of Donegal County Council compiled an inventory and was amazed at the amount of buildings lying idle, either through the church, secondary school or primary school. We have a bank of premises that could be used in a positive and productive way at inter-agency, local level. I am not referring to inter-agency work at a policy level with briefs and bringing people together. Every parish in the country has buildings that are not utilised. All that is required is leadership through community initiatives in each of these parishes. I do not like speaking about what I was involved in because everybody likes to speak about their own projects and what works best for them. However, I was employed as a youth worker on a peace and reconciliation project between 1997 and 1999 and I was on my own with one portakabin and every day after 3 p. m. 250 young people under the age of 14 crammed through the door. I was not able to do the job on my own so I looked around the town and saw student gardaí, student nurses and people on FÁS and community employment courses. Letterkenny had a database of people willing to engage and give up their time on a voluntary basis. During this two year period, more than 100 people worked in the portakabin on a voluntary basis at no cost to the State, the parents or the children. This is about co-ordination and utilising the voluntary goodwill in our communities. It is intervention for young people after 1 p. m., 2 p. m., 3 p. m. and 4 p. m. We still have a mindset that education stops once the school bag lands on the kitchen table and the children look for their grub. This is when the problems start. After school and at weekends let us give our young people something positive in which to engage. Let us give them the advantages to change the culture. We can do this. I know I used a negative example of the cultural shifts and changes in rural Ireland. However, we can change this culture and the only way we will do it is through community empowerment and intervention, utilising the goodwill out there and showing some leadership.",26/06/2008,30,7,9,I wish to share time with,Deputy Andrew Doyle,I will have 12 minutes and Deputy Doyle eight I congratulate my parliamentary soccer colleague the Minister of State Deputy,Deputy Andrew Doyle,3878518_1,,I wish to share time with Deputy Andrew Doyle I will have 12 minutes and Deputy Doyle eight I congratulate my parliamentary soccer colleague the Minister of State Deputy,I wish to share time with I will have 12 minutes and Deputy Doyle eight I congratulate my parliamentary soccer colleague the Minister of State Deputy,text306,0,2,0,0,26,0.076923077,2,1.609437912,0.061901458,-0.2,-0.007692308,0.925925926,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.954954955,0.116116116,0.091091091,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1806961,569,9,91,"Industrial Development Bill, 1977: Second Stage (Resumed).",08/11/1977,Professor John M. Kelly,Fine Gael,Dublin South-Central,"When we adjourned last Wednesday I had spoken for about 20 minutes. I had explained to the House that if the Minister's speech had contained nothing except the description of the contents of the Bill I would not have spoken for even 20 minutes because the Bill itself is plainly desirable and overdue. Not only had it been drafted under the Minister's predecessor but it had been introduced and had gone some distance through Second Stage. There would be no necessity, therefore, to hold up the House in regard to the Bill had the Minister not taken the opportunity to speak, in a somewhat larger perspective, about industrial development generally and in particular about the Industrial Development Consortium of which, for the first time, he gave the House and the country details last Wednesday. I asked the Taoiseach the following morning not to order this item for last Thursday because I wanted to think about this consortium and talk to others about it. I emphasised that that was my only reason and I could not understand why I was ruled out of order in making that request because I understood that representation to the Taoiseach in regard to the Order of Business is properly made on the Order of Business, if not at any other time. However, the point did not arise because the other business on Thursday [396] occupied the day. The Bill is now back here and I want to speak for some time about the consortium. It has been mentioned by Government speakers on a couple of occasions since the election—by Deputy O'Donoghue, as Minister for Economic Planning and Development on 4th October and by the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in reply to a question from Deputy Desmond two weeks ago. But we did not get details of it until now. In order to put it in a political setting I must recall to the House some of the more conspicuous items in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. Under the heading 'Industry and Commerce' in the first part of the manifesto and under the aspect of the pending disastrous unemployment situation unless stern and drastic action were taken the party made the following undertaking: State Agencies set up to help the various industrial activities will be given a new direction and sense of purpose by—— I am quoting absolutely literally: ——a Séan Lemass type Industrial Development Consortium. I hope I am not so petty as to begrudge the late Séan Lemass the credit he is entitled to for his achievements as Minister. He does not require any eulogy from me his devotion and, above all, his practical approach to problems, are well known. At the same time, even the late Séan Lemass was not above making mistakes, and now that his name has been invoked in the context of the consortium I may remind the House that in 1950 he led the opposition of the entire Fianna Fáil Party to the first Industrial Development Authority Bill. He described the Bill which set up this authority, to which Ireland owes the fact that we are not a potato Republic, as 'a typical product of the Fine Gael mind'. If it was that, I am proud to repeat those words today, because if there was one development in the last generation which ensured that the decline in agricultural employment, [397] which was steeper here, perhaps, than in other parts of Western Europe, would to some extent at least be taken up by native industry. The Industrial Development Authority ensured that. If there was one thing more than another which ensured that that would be so, it was the IDA, which sprang from the heart and brain of the party to which I belong and which was bitterly opposed by the Deputies opposite who trooped into the lobby against it in July, 1950, led by Éamon de Valera, seconded by Seán Lemass, who called it a product of the Fine Gael mind, and damned it up and down the country for as long and as hard as they could. I am glad and proud that 'typical product of the Fine Gael mind' has survived for 27 years the sneers and gibes of men who were not in their first youth when they said these things. Mr. Séan Lemass was no beardless fledgling when he damned the IDA, but was 50 years of age with 16 years of experience as a Minister behind him. His view was that all that line of country was well looked after by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that all that was necessary for Irish industrial development would take place in Kildare Street. I do not take away from his achievements, but his performance on that occasion and in this context disqualifies him from being ranked as a standard, beyond dispute or argument, of excellence and wisdom. Having set the record straight in regard to the IDA, where it sprang from, who were its friends and enemies over the years, let me say in fairness to the memory of the late Taoiseach, I do not believe that he would have been seen dead with the twopenny-halfpenny outfit which this consortium threatens to be. Although I do not dispute that this consortium may do some good, to dignify it, in the context of a revolutionary and radical weapon to combat unemployment, with the appending of the late Séan Lemass's name, is an insult to him which no one on this side of the House has been guilty of. There is an element of sham and pretence about it which the late Séan Lemass would [398] have despised. It is not a consortium at all. In case anybody in or outside the House does not know it, a consortium, in the ordinary usage of the English language, is a commercial venture in which several persons take part, share risks and pool resources. There is not one iota of that element in the consortium being proposed. The only reason it is being given this title of 'consortium' is to make up in weight of words what it otherwise lacks in order to be put in the balance beside the National Development Corporation, which the Labour Party advocated, in and out of Government, and any similar enterprise of a large scale in which the people involved would actively create employment. From reading the Minister's speech and from the other clues that emerged in the party's manifesto and in other references since the election, one will see that this consortium is really a committee. Committees have their use, but the public have learned that a committee is a way of giving an appearance of being preoccupied with something when nothing is being done. If the Minister is hoping that by christening this thing a 'consortium' he will avoid that criticism, I can promise him that as long as I am here he is very much mistaken. This is not a commercial consortium. There is no contribution of moneys or anything else except time from the persons involved. They are not directly going into business they are not directly empowered to spend money they have no statutory basis and, if I understand the Parliamentary Secretary correctly, they will have no authority basis. The consortium has no power apart from whatever prestige its members may give it, which may be considerable. I am not saying that it will have no utility. It ought to have some utility if it is properly operated. I do not damn it in the way that the late Séan Lemass damned the IDA before it got off the ground. But if, as it appears, this is being held out to the people as a major weapon to combat unemployment, it is a sham and a fraud, like so much more of the manifesto. We can contrast this with the [399] National Development Corporation which Members of the Labour Party advocated during the course of the last Dáil and which was taken up by the party in general during the last election and with which my party in some degree at least agreed. I have no ideological objection one way or the other to a National Development Corporation. I expressed views a couple of times about it which were intended to place a question mark over it, because unless I know what a corporation of this kind will do I cannot judge it. To talk in grand terms about a National Development Corporation is fine, but are there genuine wealth producing economic activities still left undone here? If the answer to that is 'yes', then why have they been left undone? Why has private enterprise not grappled with these major economic tasks? If the answer is that these tasks are of such a dimension that they are too big for the private sector, that private capital, although considerable in some instances, is just not big enough to cope with the investment which work of that kind would require, then I freely concede the necessity for a National Development Corporation. But I have every objection to such a corporation if it will only make paper jobs, or go into unfair competition with private enterprise. There is no doubt that a National Development Corporation run along the right lines, having identified tasks which are beyond private enterprise, and going about those tasks in the right way, as the ESB did in regard to the generation of electricity, as Bord na Móna did in the development of our bogs, would be an asset. It is quite possible that in the offshore area in the future there may be jobs which are beyond private enterprise of a kind that can be mobilised here and it may be that a body such as a National Development Corporation would be the ideal body to deal with the exploitation of the wealth beneath the sea bed. Such a development corporation would be producing visible jobs in a way of which the private sector would have been incapable. To that extent it would be deserving of support. But [400] this consortium does not and cannot create jobs. What it can do is co-ordinate activity, and to that extent I support it and will watch its progress sympathetically. As one person I consulted put it, it can avoid the unnecessary wrangling that sometimes goes on, it can short-circuit conflicts, it can cut a corner off a triangle, it can make sure that two conflicting strategies are not being applied simultaneously by two different bodies. If it does that, it will justify its existence. It will not be possible to quantify its success in that field in terms of jobs created. The Government, to their credit, are not trying to pretend that unemployment is not a problem—it has been a big issue here over the last few years—but they are not doing much to solve it. Perhaps it is beyond solution by a Government but to the extent that this is admitted on all sides to be a problem, it is fair to say that whatever chance this consortium may have of easing relations between semi-State bodies involved in the direct creation of employment and in the indirect creation of employment it should have some effect. I hope it will be successful and will justify its having been started. A Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy—although no doubt with a lot of other things on his mind—should be able to do that co-ordination himself. When he foresees or hears of a conflict coming, or when he sees a knot being tangled up between two or three different agencies, he ought to be able by a few telephone calls to disentangle it. Although I dislike the fraudulent name of this consortium—for the reasons I have given— I do not despair of their being able to do that job in so far as it smoothes industrial development and the problems arising, and in so far as it facilitates relationships between the IDA on the one side and Córas Tráchtála or the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards on the other. Probably they will do a useful job in that respect. The Minister's words about it went somewhat further than mere co-ordination. If I may quote from [401] column 155 of the Official Report of 2nd November, 1977, he said: The remit of the consortium will include the following: (a) setting job creation targets and monitoring and reviewing industrial progress in general, with particular reference to job creation and job maintenance (b) identification of obstacles to growth and suggesting solutions, and (c) co-ordination of activities of existing State agencies to maximise the contribution of these agencies to industrial development. I must tell the House that any views I have heard on this consortium have not been hostile ones at all. Nevertheless they have all tended spontaneously to the view that the only worthwhile operation that can be expected of this consortium is one of a co-ordinating type. The business of setting job targets and identifying obstacles can be undertaken by the Minister himself. The obstacles to job creation or to industrial growth are known by several bodies here and do not require a committee to put them into some different form of words. Over and above that there is a certain degree of overlap here. I do not mention this as a criticism of the consortium. But there does appear to be a certain degree of overlap between the first two of these three objectives and some of the duties of the National Economic and Social Council. Incidentally, I note that a couple of the bodies which the Minister envisages for representation on this consortium are at present on the NESC. This may be no harm, but it takes somewhat from what might appear to be the originality of the tasks set for this consortium. When the Minister comes to reply I daresay I will be asked why I did not make more specific observations on this consortium instead of merely putting it in a perspective unflattering to the Government party. I make one specific criticism of it—I do not mean this in a particularly hostile way but I feel it is apt—it has one serious failing. I do not overlook the fact that it is described specifically as industrial. [402] Of course, it is being sold to the Dáil and to the people as the substitute for or the Fianna Fáil answer to the National Development Corporation which had achieved a certain amount of publicity and attracted a certain amount of attention when promulgated by the Labour Party. There is one very conspicuous difference—apart even from the ones I have mentioned—between what might be a National Development Corporation on the one hand and, in the narrow sense, a purely industrial consortium. It is this: that the former, obviously or potentially, includes agricultural and allied operations and the latter excludes them. Any interpretation of words which would exclude agriculture from industry, except where the context necessitates it, would be idiotic. But that the exclusion of agriculture is intended here is plain from the fact that no agricultural body is envisaged as being represented on this consortium. If the Minister has in mind that what we need is more and more industrial jobs, in the narrow sense, the production of transportable goods and so on, that is all right I do not quarrel with it. But what he has in mind is something which is supposed to be an answer to a larger plan of an all-embracing kind. Then I say it has this evident effect: there is no representation, as far as the Minister's speech goes, from agriculture or any sector surrounding agriculture anywhere on it. The agricultural sector is one the job potential of which is constantly being pressed not only by the farmers themselves but by the Minister for Agriculture. Every week I take up a paper and find that a farmer leader, an IFA leader, the Minister for Agriculture, somebody from the ICMSA or somebody from the general agricultural world is appealing to people not to think of job creation purely in terms of the service sector, or of transportable goods but rather to see the possibility for their creation in agriculture. I know that is not the Minister's remit. If he has been given this baby he will not want to be [403] bothered about agricultural operations. I have never set myself up as an expert on this, and I hope I do not show my ignorance too blatantly by embarking on the topic. But the degree to which there are job opportunities there or openings, if the thing is properly organised, is evident virtually every week and most recently in an article in The Irish Times of 25th October from which it emerged—if the statements in it are true, which I assume them to be they were made by the Chairman of the Sugar Company—that over half of the sugar beet processed in the Tuam factory comes from east of the Shannon, although of course beet produced west of the Shannon that much more may reduce the demand for it in the south. The west is an area everyone regards as requiring special treatment that is agreed on all sides of the House, though I am not exactly sure why. Therefore it is felt that money must be invested there at a higher level, incentives given at a higher level or of a kind that do not exist elsewhere in order to support the west. Yet we find that the Tuam beet factory cannot supply its requirements of sugar beet from the western counties. Two weeks previously I read, from the leader of the IFA, that in the counties of Galway and Mayo alone there are ten million underdeveloped acres. It seemed to me to be beyond belief, unless there was a misprint involved. Assuming that I am correct, or that he was correct and it was not a misprint, that is a figure which ought to stare any Minister of a Government anxious to tackle unemployment straight in the eye-ball. The fact that the Tuam beet factory cannot get enough beet from the area around it and that therefore its costs increase and the possibilities of offering a good price for the product go down—this is necessitated by their having to haul their supplies from west Cork—and the fact that the two counties which surround the town of Tuam, Mayo just a few miles to the north of it, and Galway, contain ten million under-developed acres, those two factors must [404] stare a Government in the eye-ball if they are serious about combating unemployment not only being serious about it but willing, as the Tánaiste and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development appeared to be warning us, to take dramatic action of a kind never experienced in the country before in order to put an end to it. I am waiting with a certain amount of excitement the budget in January until we see what drastic action of a kind never taken before will be offered this House. Any Minister who says that is perfectly right. I agree with the Tánaiste when he says that conventional methods of solving job problems and the conventional drib here and drab there, one little scheme this year and another little scheme next year, will not suffice. He is perfectly right. Even operations of a kind far more wide-ranging, ambitious, startling, experimental and possibly even doomed to failure will be necessary if we are to solve this problem permanently. When talking to the Stock Exchange on the 13th October the Tánaiste made a speech which I am sure he would not mind my calling remarkable in every other respect—much what one might expect to be given at a professional dinner—but he did have a couple of paragraphs I think were his own. They deserved more attention than they got. He said: The success of the Government's programme is vital to the nation's future. Indeed the next four years could well determine the kind of nation we are going to be for generations ahead. Our approach to the economic challenges immediately ahead will determine whether Ireland becomes a thriving and progressive European state or a peripheral backwater relying on emigration and handouts from Brussels to solve its chronic social problems. He went on to say: The scope and objectives of past economic programmes would be quite inadequate today. In other words, the kind of operation we have been getting along with—and [405] great credit is due to those involved, such as the Industrial Development Authority—will not do anymore by itself. He said: Policies aimed simply at 'keeping the show on the road', settling perhaps for minor improvements every year are no longer good enough. What is needed is a radical assault on our economic shortcomings. It is in the context of that kind of cry of alarm—I do not think it is at all contemptible because it is called for and the Minister was right to utter it— I say that the facts relating to agriculture which I have just quoted must stare the Government in the eyeball and must call for an interference in our way of conducting the economy that goes beyond anything we have been able to absorb in the past. Perhaps it goes beyond what people may conventionally think of as their private rights in regard to the management of their own affairs. I hope no one will accuse me of being a doctrinaire socialist—I am not —but I think any solution within the four corners of justice, humanity and fair play to the problems which all sides of the House agree are greater than they have been for 57 years should be tried. Perhaps it should not be done nationally. Let us experiment in one place for a limited time. Although I know it will not accord with the job expectations of many people, I would not be against an attempt to provide jobs in agriculture in the direct employment of the State by way of a massive land reclamation project of the kind James Dillon launched in 1948, but going far beyond that. I cannot see why we should make schemes for tarmacadaming playgrounds, for fiddling around doing small jobs that end in a few months and that leave young people more depressed at the end of them. Why should we fiddle around with these jobs when the Shannon is there to be drained? We are not in a situation that is comparable to the other EEC countries. The Belgians have an unemployment rate that is our league— perhaps not quite as bad—somewhere [406] around 8. 7 per cent or 8. 8 per cent. It is no use telling the Belgians to embark on a large-scale reclamation of their land—their chief natural resource—because every yard is already in use. They have no real work to fall back on, because they are going their hardest as it is. We are in a quite different situation, one that is unique in the EEC, in that we have tens of millions of acres in each of the provinces that are absolutely under-used. Even a 'jackeen' who does not know one end of a spade from the other, but who travels from Dublin to Galway can see that. That will not be acceptable to those people who expected that a vote for Fianna Fáil meant a white collar job for their children. It will not interest them or excite them, but if this Government are serious they will have to look at economic development in the way I have outlined. They will have to look at the jobs that need to be done and at the available labour and they must match those two things. If the Government are afraid to do that, if they are afraid to offend the parents of those who are looking for jobs by giving them anything except a white collar job, they will fail. They will leave the next Government of whatever party with a job that is ten times harder, with a population that is ten times more restive and spoiled than was inherited by this Government. I have one more suggestion that I hope the Minister will not treat with scorn. I am encouraged to make it because the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development separately in the past six weeks have picked up a theme that I have often played on myself, namely, enlisting the active support of the people in groups that are small enough to preserve their sense of identity and neighbourliness and of mobilising the groups in some way in pursuit of the programme of ending unemployment and of giving ourselves at last a stable and prosperous country. On several occasions the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development have been talking about co-operation and co-operatives. I have a suggestion for them. I [407] put it forward as an experiment that may fail but if that happens we will know not to try it again. I suggest they might identify some parts of the country where socially the ground might seem promising and then set up total co-operatives in these areas that might have an optimum population of 10,000 to 15,000 people. They should feed into the co-operatives not money, because people are conditioned to look for money for everything, but rather they should give them advice. They should send pioneer teams recruited from the semi-State agencies to the areas concerned and leave them there for a few years. We could then see if the town or parish in question could be made after three or four years into a show place, with no emigration or unemployment, with no derelict buildings or under-developed land and where every natural resource is exploited to the full. We should try this experiment on a small scale if it cannot be done on such a scale there is no use in talking about it on a large scale. I emphasise that they should be total co-operatives, not just restricted to agriculture or to the conventional sectors where co-operatives have operated in the past. Alternatively, let the Government invite the people in a town or district to set up their own total co-operatives. I realise that I may be stepping on a political minefield here, but the Government should free such co-operatives from all liability for stamp duty or taxation in the process of making them into companies. In other words, the Government should clear the red tape and expense out of the way for that purpose. I do not want this argument confused with the argument about the taxation of co-operatives. When a co-operative becomes an enormous business with a turnover of many millions of pounds it is not in the same situation as the original co-operative, which represents the efforts of a small community trying to lift itself up by its boot straps. Such a co-operative should be free of taxation. The Government should invite people to see if they can control their destinies and provide jobs for themselves within a community of 10,000 [408] or 15,000 people. What I have suggested may be impracticable but when I hear the Minister for Finance talking about radical means, about using methods that were never used before, I want to put forward my suggestion. If the experiment fails I will not say anymore about it. The help of the people should be enlisted. In countries such as ours the political parties recklessly compete in issuing promises, all of them tending in the same direction, namely, to remove from the individual the burden that human life represents for everyone in some measure. That is the big defect in a parliamentary democracy, though one that is far outweighed by its virtues—I have no misgivings in that regard. I am sorry, but I must accuse the party on the far side of this House of being by far the greatest sinners in this regard. When Kevin O'Higgins lay dying he said of that party that they would 'play down to the people's weaknesses'. Not a word of reproach escaped him for his own death, or for anything else that happened. They have played down to the people's weaknesses. That is what they have done non-stop for 50 years. I am afraid that the consequences will be that the people will not be in a condition to help themselves and that the Government are not able to do so. Surely the Minister is not under the illusion that he and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and other Ministers with economic remits are going to succeed in a country like this when countries with enormous accumulations of wealth, experience and legislative power of a kind which we have not got have failed, countries with deeper rooted industrial traditions. The best of luck to them—I do not believe in having a grovelling respect for the foreigner because we do too much of that—but surely it cannot be supposed that by virtue of supporting one party more than another we are going to get a result which the Belgians, Dutch and Germans have not been able to get. The Germans are horrified at their unemployment figures and their inflation rate. They have an inflation mania although their inflation rate is so low that it is something we have not had since the fifties. [409] The defect in our democratic system is that the people are led to expect that more and more burdens will be taken from them, and that they will become less fit to help themselves. The problem we are talking about cannot be solved by governments. I do not blame Fianna Fáil for not being able to solve the unemployment problem but I do blame them for defrauding the people into believing that they can solve it. The problem is beyond the wit of a Government, unless supported by strong self-reliant structures among the people. That is something for which the Fianna Fáil Party are mainly responsible. Down the years they have done their best to destroy such structures. Whenever they have seen a man carrying a burden for himself they rushed in and said 'We will let you off that. Vote for us and you will not have to pay car tax and rates. Naturally, we will still provide the road for you to drive your car on and the services for which the rates formerly paid.' That is tomorrow's problem and will be dealt with in the manner in which the Minister for the Environment is dealing with problems —he thinks about them and hopes for a report that will see him through. That attitude is the chief enemy of economic development and everything else. I believe that the Government have only one hope of solving the problem and that is by getting the people behind them, not politically, but to do it for themselves within the minimum framework in which such a thing is possible. If you look at the kinds of communities which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development had in mind and the kinds of things that go on in these communities, you will be amazed at the degree to which self-reliance and voluntary effort already exist. During the summer I did a study to establish the degree to which localities differed in this regard. I made a survey of some areas based on the existence of certain forms of co-operative initiative. I opened a census of population at random today and noted the following towns. The town of Athy in County Kildare has a credit union, a Macra [410] na Tuaithe guild, an Irish Country Women's Association guild, a local development association, and it has been a competitor for many years in the Tidy Towns Competition. The town of Callan has all these things plus a co-operative society. The towns of Birr, Ballinasloe, Athenry and Loughrea have all these things. In addition to these six criteria of my own, which were arbitrarily chosen, there are innumerable ways in which people voluntarily co-operate. I am only scratching the surface by mentioning these things. There is Civil Defence, the Red Cross, St. John's Ambulance Brigade and the St. Vincent de Paul Society. In every Irish town a great number of people are already engaged in trying to better their conditions. A Government intent on taking drastic action, or making a drastic experiment, ought to extend that experiment into seeing whether the same can be done on the economic plane as well. I will not accuse Fianna Fáil of shedding their responsibilities if they attempt to do that. If they make an honest attempt to enlist the people in manageable sized communities to form themselves into mechanisms of economic effort they may get somewhere. It may be a failure but I believe it would be worth while to attempt it. The Bill is one which this party welcomes. The Minister explained the Bill in his speech. I am sorry I told the Minister that he had not mentioned the developing countries in his speech. He had referred to the developing countries but I missed his reference to them. The important sections, apart from that one and the operation of section 5 which brings the functions of the authority under existing financial umbrellas, are 2 and 3. The former is intended to provide capital for mergers and amalgamations of a kind which, had they taken place with this facility in the past, might have avoided some closures and redundancies. A worthwhile provision in section 3 relates to the provision of capital for somebody who is not a businessman but has experience of a kind which makes his success a strong possibility, somebody who has [411] been an executive or an engineer in an existing business and who wants to start off on his own. That is a positive move. Generally, the Bill is overdue but welcome and this party support it wholeheartedly.",08/11/1977,21,3918,3919,Dublin to Galway can see that That will not be acceptable to those people who expected that a vote for,Fianna Fáil,meant a white collar job for their children It will not interest them or excite them but if this Government,Fianna Fáil,1806961_9,,Dublin to Galway can see that That will not be acceptable to those people who expected that a vote for Fianna Fáil meant a white collar job for their children It will not interest them or excite them but if this Government,Dublin to Galway can see that That will not be acceptable to those people who expected that a vote for meant a white collar job for their children It will not interest them or excite them but if this Government,text543,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,-0.272865034,-0.006821626,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.075075075,0.105105105,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1851165,313,14,98,"Private Members' Business. - An Bille um an S&eacute &uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1978: An Dara C&eacute im. Sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1978: Second Stage.",24/10/1978,Mr. Barry Desmond,The Labour Party,Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown,"I formally support the Bill which was so effectively and comprehensively introduced by my colleague Deputy Mrs. Desmond. I want to give an assurance to the House and to the Minister on a number of items in our approach to this Bill. We want a constructive debate. As a political party we are completely open to a response. In no way do we regard our Bill as being an entirely definitive instrument on the totality of the subject. We know there is great sensitivity needed in the drafting of any such legislation. Indeed, a week ago in his response to a query as to why there is not a Government Bill before the House on this matter, the Taoiseach said there are major difficulties. We accept that there are considerable difficulties. We know this as a political party and from the various representations we have received, some as far back as ten years ago. I have been here for ten years and Deputy Eileen Desmond has been in one or other of the Houses for longer. In our day to day work during that time we have come face to face with the disabilities and the inadequacies of the legislation in existence, with the positive discrimination of existing legislation in relation to adoption, the social and legal rights of illegitimate children and other matters. I want to stress the appalling reflection on our parliamentary system of the extent to which the Labour Party have access to the body of constitutional opinion on this matter. It is negligible. We know there is a great deal of sympathy on this issue, on the lack of humanity and sensitivity, and we in this party are open to conviction as to the views of the Minister, the Attorney-General and the constitutional draftsmen on this Bill and on its shortcomings. The fundamental purpose of the debate is to try to light a fire under the [1062] subject after so many years of sporadic public discussion, to try to make some progress in regard to the need for constitutional reform in this area and to remedy the situation as rapidly as possible. There is nothing more discouraging to people, be they members of my own family who are involved in adoption or social workers not only here but in England who make constant inquiries as to the precise limitations in this area in regard to existing relationships between adoptive parents and their children or in relation to our socially outrageous discrimination in regard to illegitimate children and their rights of succession. It is outrageously discouraging that we should allow this situation to continue without providing clarification. I can assure the Minister that we do not approach this debate even from a Labour Party political point of view. Our basic aim is to see to what extent we can make progress. We have difficulties even in that because at this moment we do not know the mind of the Government in relation to this issue. There have been numerous speeches, or half speeches, with great deference to the Minister and the Taoiseach and to my constituency colleague, Deputy Andrews, on this matter of illegitimacy. After nearly two years of experience of a clear-cut constitutional opinion, it is about time we got down to work to clarify the position. There are only 22 sitting days left before Christmas. Even if we started tomorrow on a Bill to amend the Constitution, we would be doing extraordinarily well to have it through by Christmas. When we come back at the end of January we will be involved up to our tonsils in the budget debate and this Bill will slide into oblivion until the middle of next year, when the Government will be able to advance the argument that the European and local elections will be held and that we could not possibly have a referendum on the Constitution. Therefore I would strongly impress on the Minister the concern of this party that we should not allow things to drift until the end of next year. We come to the problem of a referendum on a Constitution amendment. I do not know to what extent this has been [1063] discussed at Cabinet level, but I now ask the Government to make provision for an early Constitution referendum, if necessary in conjunction with the European elections. There is not a councillor in the country who would shed a tear if the local elections were not held next year—they could be postponed for a year by a simple Government order. Now that the rates have been abolished there is very little power left in the hands of local councils. Therefore, it should not be beyond the wit of the Government to bring forward a referendum on a constitutional amendment in respect of which I have no doubt 95 per cent of the Irish people would vote 'yes'. We are faced with the appalling situation that nobody seems to know the precise form such a constitutional amendment would take. The Government apparently have two distinct views and we have never had a clear-cut opinion from the Law Reform Commission. It is not good enough that after 15 months of government we should be faced with a situation where an opposition party have to put this matter on the table. Other constitutional matters such as the question of bail fade into insignificance by comparison with this area, and I would ask the Government to allow for the referendum to be held simultaneously with the European elections. If it is not politic for the Government to postpone the local elections for another year and if we have to have three ballot papers on the one day I have no doubt that such is the overwhelming national opinion on this issue, an opinion that something must be done rapidly—the precise parameters of the framework of the amendment are still somewhat clouded—that people would vote in the European elections, the local election and simultaneously give a resounding 'yes' to the necessary dual amendments of the Constitution. There is a way ahead and an opportunity open to the Government on this. I am aware of the comments the Minister has made on this issue here and to outside organisations. I know that by and large he is in agreement with us that the country needs the necessary amendments [1064] to the Constitution. There is no need for me to mention the vast amount of material available to Members on this issue. When I was in Opposition in 1971-72 I wrote an article to The Irish Times on the question of adoption and I was confident then that something would be done, but in the four years we were in Office we did not do much about it. During that period we got a very solid kick in the rump by virtue of court proceedings and constitutional opinion. Therefore, there are no political kudos to be gained on this issue. Before the politicians become discredited on this issue—there are a number of serious constitutional issues on which we are almost totally discredited be it adoption, divorce or family planning—we should ensure that adoption does not enter into that litany of necessary social legislative change on which we have failed miserably. We have received representations on this issue from at least 20 organisations and many individuals, and they all deserve better of us. I earnestly plead with the Minister, on behalf of adopted children and those who will be adopted and enjoy the blessing, the warmth and love of family life, such as we have been fortunate enough to enjoy, to help bestow that blessing on many more children. We should do it for those who are the subject of adoption orders and, in particular, we should eliminate the unchristian, anti-social, viciously discriminatory status in our society in relation to illegitimacy which has been a blot on Irish nationhood, nationality and citizenship for decades. We should grasp this opportunity, and it is within the competence of the Minister to do so. I can assure the Minister that we are open to suggestions on this matter. The Taoiseach, in his initial response, made some criticisms across the House, but we are prepared to listen to those and any criticisms the Minister may make. We are prepared to make this an all-Party matter, and if the Minister wants an all-Party Committee to frame an agreed piece of legislation on adoption we would be agreeable. We would nominate our Members overnight to such a committee. I implore the Minister to deal with this matter urgently [1065] and ensure that before the year is out we can say that we passed a piece of legislation which redounds to the credit and public responsibility of the Parliament.",24/10/1978,21,163,165,representations we have received some as far back as ten years ago I have been here for ten years and,Deputy Eileen Desmond,has been in one or other of the Houses for longer In our day to day work during that time,Deputy Eileen Desmond,1851165_1,,representations we have received some as far back as ten years ago I have been here for ten years and Deputy Eileen Desmond has been in one or other of the Houses for longer In our day to day work during that time,representations we have received some as far back as ten years ago I have been here for ten years and has been in one or other of the Houses for longer In our day to day work during that time,text436,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.134396801,0.00335992,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.651651652,0.616616617,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4431533,2173,8,43,Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013: Second Stage (Continued),01/03/2013,Mr. Michael McGrath,Fianna Fáil,Cork South-Central,"In my view, the Minister must go further. People living on estates affected by pyrite whose houses are not themselves affected do not receive an exemption. In most cases, those people will be unable to sell their houses as no bank will provide a mortgage to a prospective purchaser in such circumstances. The cost of proving pyrite damage may be prohibitive even though a visual examination would show its obvious presence. The Minister has granted a limited exemption to charities including scouting and girl guide associations which provide weekend-type accommodation to their members. This is welcome. Charities fulfil an important societal need, particularly at the present time. Their State funding has been cut and donations are well down. The exemption in the original Bill is only for charities that use properties solely or primarily to provide special needs accommodation. Special needs accommodation is defined as 'accommodation provided to persons who by reason of old age, physical or mental disability or other cause require special accommodation and support to enable them to live in the community'. The definition is potentially too narrow. We would appreciate if the Minister could clarify whether it is intended that the exemption will also apply to persons with special needs whose accommodation is of a type which could not be considered to be in the community. Examples include the accommodation of very vulnerable people such as those living in Stewarts Hospital, which assists people with a range of intellectual disabilities, some of whom can interact with the community and some of whom cannot. Other examples include the facilities attached to Crumlin Children's Hospital in Ronald McDonald House and the accommodation at Temple Street Children's Hospital for the parents of very sick children. We are concerned that these facilities may not meet the definition in the legislation. A requirement to pay the property tax would place an unfair burden on the providers of these services. If the property tax is to work in practice, it is essential that a clear and detailed guide to valuation is provided to underpin compliance and ensure property owners pay the appropriate level of tax. In reality, the Revenue Commissioners will say one's house has a particular valuation and it will be up to one's self to show that it is worth less than that, if it is. The cost of a professional valuation is likely to be prohibitive and in many cases people will simply give in and pay the Revenue Commissioners' assessment. Consumers often complain, for example, about the high valuation for VRT purposes imposed by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of imported cars. The economist Ronan Lyons has suggested this could be avoided if people were given a tax credit to have their homes assessed by a qualified professional working to a standardised national checklist, as happens in the BER scheme. This scheme would provide the Revenue Commissioners in the first year with the necessary information on dwelling type, size, age, location and other factors affecting value in order to perform meaningful auditing. The newly established property price register does not assist in this regard as it contains none of the property characteristics required to assess value. The register will be of limited use to most people in determining their liability under the taxation regime. The Bill represents a missed opportunity. It is Fianna Fáil's genuine view that this is not the right time to introduce a tax on family homes. We published alternative proposals which would have raised at least as much revenue in 2013 as the property tax. Given that the Government has enacted the primary legislation required to introduce the tax, it will rue the opportunity it has missed with the Bill before the House now. The Government could have established a much fairer basis for the charge if it had adopted some of the measures Fianna Fáil proposed. It is not too late. Committee, Report and Final Stages take place next week and we have tabled, as have other Opposition parties and groupings, amendments which will make the tax fairer and help to achieve a greater degree of public acceptance. In the next couple of weeks, the Revenue Commissioners will start to issue letters to householders nationally. People are very fearful. An elderly man called my office the other day to express his fear that he would lose his home because he is not able to pay the property tax. While we reassured him that will not be the case, it is a measure of the fear and anxiety that exists. People are genuinely finding things tough, as the Minister knows well. The thresholds he has set for a deferral are miserly and need to be reviewed. I do not know when was the last time a Cabinet member tried to live with his or her family on €480 a week. Half of that sum will be spent on essential groceries alone, with a further requirement to pay for electricity, gas and other essential household bills, before one even considers the mortgage. The thresholds must be revised. While the Minister is clearly not going to reverse the decision to introduce the tax, he could certainly make it far more palatable and fair than is provided for currently. I hope that in the debate on Tuesday some of the amendments that have been proposed will be accepted.",01/03/2013,31,641,642,The Government could have established a much fairer basis for the charge if it had adopted some of the measures,Fianna Fáil,proposed It is not too late Committee Report and Final Stages take place next week and we have tabled as,Fianna Fáil,4431533_1,,The Government could have established a much fairer basis for the charge if it had adopted some of the measures Fianna Fáil proposed It is not too late Committee Report and Final Stages take place next week and we have tabled as,The Government could have established a much fairer basis for the charge if it had adopted some of the measures proposed It is not too late Committee Report and Final Stages take place next week and we have tabled as,text892,2,2,0,1,40,0,0,0,0,-0.091706052,-0.002292651,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.216216216,0.233233233,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2462542,604,8,90,"Financial Resolutions, 1990. - Financial Resolution No. 9: General (Resumed).",08/03/1990,Mr. Tom Kitt,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South,"Let me get back to the real world, a world in which we must pay our debts and make adequate provision for our people, the disadvantaged, those with no jobs and those who want a future here. People want a clean environment, free from pollution and nuclear waste, free from fear of crime and war, and free from inequality and injustice. The most important point is that people feel free. It is a tall order to have to put together a budget, so how did the budget measure up? I would like to deal with one or two specific points and maybe make some suggestions because it is the rôle of backbenchers to make suggestions. The business expansion scheme deserves a mention in this debate. The success of this scheme is entirely due to the amendments of the 1987 legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil, when the tourist sector and shipping activities were included as qualifying activities. In his budget speech, the Minister indicated that he was asking the Revenue Commissioners to look at some schemes being submitted to them within the framework of the existing legislation. Some groups have attempted to use the scheme of tax relief to provide what is effectively loan capital to projects while dressing this up as equity participation through share issues which qualify under the business expansion scheme. The scheme has many beneficial effects. Wider share ownership is being promoted and there should be substantial [2091] improvements, to the tourist infrastructure through the development of hotels and other leisure facilities. The Minister for Tourism and Transport has expressed reservations about property developers making use of the scheme. I share his concern but I would ask the Minister for Finance to retain his essentially positive attitude towards the scheme when considering any legislative changes to be made in the Finance Bill. The principal area of potential abuse, if I may call it that, is in the hotel building sector. I would suggest that if the Minister were to ensure that funds raised had to go to build new facilities rather than fund the purchase of existing facilities, the more obvious seams would be prevented. A critical examination of the guidelines laid down by Bord Fáilte would serve to restrict manipulators of the scheme. Companies are only allowed to spend limited percentages of the money raised under the scheme on land and buildings. However, the application of these guidelines laid down by Bord Fáilte is far from clear. A hotel is restricted to 65 per cent of the amount of its total assets to be employed in land and buildings. One way of restricting and controlling the use of the business expansion scheme in this area would be to critically examine the application of the guidelines, possibly reducing them but definitely laying down stricter criteria as to their application. Before I leave this topic I would like to suggest that the Minister consider introducing a form of roll-over relief for capital gains tax purposes in connection with business expansion scheme shares. An individual who sells his shares within the five year period and who would normally incur a claw-back if he rein-could defer this claw-back if he reinvested in further qualifying shares. This measure would create a market in the shares of many of these companies and would promote wider share ownership in general and the business expansion scheme in particular, with no cost to the Exchequer. On the question of tax rates it has to [2092] be pointed out that between 1987 and 1990 the top rate of tax has been cut by 5 per cent, from 58 to 53 per cent, and the standard rate has also been cut by 5 per cent, from 35 to 30 per cent. This dramatic reduction in tax has been achieved despite the grim state of the country's finances which faced the Fianna Fáil Party when they took office after the chaos left by the fire-backed Coalition. I consider these achievements to represent nothing short of a triumph for this administration and I would warmly applaud the Government and the Minister for their significant contribution to this achievement. The contribution of some of the Minister's Deputy Reynolds, predecessors does not, unfortunately, shine forth in the same manner. Deputy Dukes, in his years as Minister for Finance, had little to show other than the inequitable and aborted farm tax and residential property tax which, to my mind, were badly drawn up and continued many serious inequities. Fine Gael showed themselves incapable of grappling with many of the structural problems affecting the tax system but Fianna Fáil are now doing this. Private sector employment depends largely on confidence. Individual employers will not take on people when they are uncertain about the future of the economy and do not feel confident about the future of their own businesses. Successive surveys of Irish business people show that business confidence is building under this Government. I firmly believe this will translate into job creation in the private sector. The reduction in tax rates, the increased numbers exempt from PRSI and the general air of business confidence, despite unwelcome development on the international front, will bring about much needed improvement in employment. This degree of confidence is shared by many international bankers. Having talked to many people in the financial world, I firmly believe that if offered the prospect of anything other than Fianna Fáil in Government, the business community both at home and abroad would take a far less sanguine [2093] view of the Irish economy as a place to leave their funds. The Programme for National Recovery has been referred to by many speakers in this debate. This was derided by many of our political opponents and by various press commentators as an election gimmick, but it has proved to be anything but that. The dramatic revitalisation of the tourist industry, the potentially enormously successful international Financial Services Centre, the commitment and adherence to the reduction of the tax burden on the average worker, were all well signalled in our programme. No matter how our opponents wish to twist the facts, there is no way they can dispute the success of this programme. We are paying our debts. My income tax — and we all feel the same about income tax — is high but not as high as it was last year or the year before. Income tax rates are coming down and the Fine Gael Party should note that in particular. Last year we commenced a process of tax reduction, we are continuing it this year and next year there will be more cuts in tax — there had better be because the rates are still too high. At the end of the day what we must draw attention to is the average worker because his tax is still too high. This is the object lesson which Fine Gael have never learned. Action, even a small action, is better than verbiage. We had plenty of verbiage from the last Coalition Government and also over the last two years. There is hardly need for the Government to restate their commitment to the poor, the disadvantaged and the unemployed, those who are most in need. Our proud record over the last two years can stand up. We can reassure the people that our priorities exist in actions, and not just in words. Of course we will give disproportionately large allocations to help those most in need and we do not claim any credit for that. We have always done that and we will always do it. It is our philosophy. It is not to be wondered at justice demands it. I read in this morning's paper that the Central Bank said that tax concessions and the social welfare measures were too [2094] generous. That shows the stark difference between Governments, financiers and banks. We do not believe these measures were too generous, and that is the direction in which we will proceed. We will provide hope for the future and we have a right to claim credit for giving hope to the people of Ireland. In the last two years, the outlook for thousands of people has been changed utterly for the better. People have hope and they know things are getting better slowly but surely. More jobs are being created, although not nearly enough and progress has been made and much more progress will be made in the years ahead. With falling personal tax rates, one of the major constraints to the creation of jobs and the exploitation of enterprise and talent is being removed. I welcome this move to lighten the burden of direct personal taxation. I see the way ahead as a continuation of this process, that is, a redistribution of direct taxation away from the individual and towards the corporate sector. While we must continue to raise revenue, there is a real limit to the amount of saving and cutting back that can be done. I have no doubt there are still areas where further savings can be made and we must find these areas and make these savings but as a community of people, it is our duty to regulate our affairs in such a way that all members of society receive equitable treatment. I am particularly pleased that real moves will be made over the next years to deal with the problem of urban smoke pollution. I look forward to the day when we will no longer dread the approach of November with its inversion into consequent smog. The living environment is of such crucial importance that we must, if we are to survive as a civilised nation, devote increasing resources, nationally and internationally, to cleaning our planet. I am satisfied that the measures being taken will lead to an increase in environmental awareness, the necessary prerequisite to introducing and sustaining long term major energy, land and resources, planning and social programmes which are specifically designed [2095] to improve and preserve the environment. We are the people who will take the action we will get the job done. The budget continues a momentum which has been gathering pace over the last few years.

They bitterly resent the fact that Deputies on this side pointed out to the people exactly what Fianna Fáil had done in relation to the taxes now under discussion, the fact that—not-withstanding the assurances given by Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee and the rest of them that these taxes would not be reimposed, that it was unnecessary to reimpose them—the taxes were reimposed. We pointed that out to the people, as we were entitled to do. As far as I am concerned, I will continue pointing it out to the people. Fianna Fáil resent that. They resent the fact that the Fianna Fáil actions in relation to these taxes and to other matters were so fully and so effectively exposed to the people. I think it was Deputy Childers who referred to the pamphlet which Deputy Aiken produced here this morning as being 'damnably effective'. It was— and it was intended to be effective. It was intended to drive home to the people just how far you could trust Fianna Fáil. This amendment and the other amendments which have been tabled here are not tabled seriously. Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee yesterday evening admitted that these were not being tabled with the serious [1375] object of having them accepted. Yet we have this little bit of play-acting from Deputy Aiken this morning. He stands up and asks: 'Is the Minister prepared to accept this amendment?' Did he not hear Deputy Lemass last night did he not hear Deputy MacEntee last night? I do not know what is the order of ascendancy in that Party, I think Deputy Lemass still has a head lead on Deputy Aiken but in any event his two colleagues put themselves on record last night as admitting, with varying degrees of frankness, that these amendments were not tabled seriously. They did not go so far as to admit that they were put down merely for the purpose of brazen play-acting, but that in fact is the purpose of these amendments. Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Aiken are not endeavouring to make any kind of serious contribution to the financial discussions in this House.

4156116,133,14,96,National Recovery Plan 2011-2014: Statements,25/11/2010,Ms. Joan Burton,The Labour Party,Dublin West,"The principal lord of misrule in regard to the disaster that has overtaken the Irish economy might be identified as Deputy Bertie Ahern. Although he is still a Member of this House and is frequently reported as having speaking engagements in the Panama Canal area and around the world, he has remained silent in terms of explaining himself to the House, to his own political party or to the people. However, he gave an interview recently for a new book by David. J. Lynch, which I believe is aimed at Irish-Americans and people in the United States to help them understand what has gone wrong in Ireland. I wish to read part of the interview into the record of the House because I believe it to be a genuine expression of the voice of Deputy Ahern, as he once misruled this country. In explanation for the disaster he states: At any time, had they come in and put the doomsday message I think we could have done a lot of things. But there was no sense, I can tell ya, of that. I mean, there wasn’t one meeting with the Central Bank guys, not one meeting where they were putting the red lights on. Not one meeting. And never did Brian Cowen or the finance officials come over to me to say that the whole thing, the bottom, was going to fall out. I know Deputy Bertie Ahern. That is so much his true and authentic voice. However, it also shows his cleverness. It is a crushing indictment of the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and of his anointed heir and successor, the present Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen. That is the voice he wishes to leave on the history book records, never being a man not to get his retaliation in and to explain the situation in his own way. It was crony capitalism that brought us to this — that golden circle of Fianna Fáil, the lord of misrule in the Galway tent and the bankers like Seanie FitzPatrick. Mr. FitzPatrick gave a lecture — an actual lecture — a year or so before we began to become familiar, in a way none [232]of us would ever have wished for, with the inner workings of Anglo Irish Bank. In his lecture, Mr. FitzPatrick, as became a mega-billionnaire, lectured us that financial regulation in Ireland was the new McCarthyism. Shortly afterwards, he lectured the Irish Government, saying that old age pensioners and others should take cut after cut. We were all young and naive then, in the early days of the financial crisis and the collapse of the banks. Although I predicted the collapse of the bubble and was the first person to raise the Quinn affair, contracts for difference and the property based tax breaks, which are all on my record in the Dáil, I never thought the wrongdoings and the bust model of Anglo Irish Bank would bring down not only AIB but possibly Bank of Ireland. This week, despite all its efforts and despite the rights issue, it is almost back to where it was before. It gives me no pleasure to say that. There, however, is the voice of Deputy Bertie Ahern. He comes in and votes in the House but never speaks although in his paid lectures he tells the world that the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen told him nothing. The Department of Finance officials also told him nothing. The Central Bank told him nothing. What would a manager in any company do? He or she would say, 'Sack the lot of them.' The Government has brought such incredible destruction to this country. This is what faces the Taoiseach more than anybody else. Where is the honour in continuing when it created this disaster? As early as 2006 I had a big argument with the now Taoiseach over contracts for difference and turning the Dublin Stock Exchange into a casino. Little did I know that today Paddy Power bookmakers is a bigger element on the Irish Stock Exchange than our banks. That tells all about the Celtic tiger which has turned into the Celtic tortoise. That is why people are so angry. David McWilliams, in his book The Pope’s Children and a recent book about the crash refers to insiders and outsiders in this country. In a way, the four year plan is about insiders and outsiders. The outsiders are the little people, who have endless capacity and energy to take it on the chin and who can have a cut in the minimum wage. There is no requirement as a quid pro quo that their bosses, whether in the public or private sector — the minimum wage is mostly a matter for the private sector — should also limit their compensation packages on a parallel with what people on the lowest wage are being asked to take. During the Dublin Theatre Festival I went to see 'Enron', by a London company, in the Gaiety. It told the story of a massive energy company which became one of the biggest financial empires in the United States and which, in its destruction, has brought, among others, the state of California close to financial ruin. However, as it is in the continental US federal system it will not bring down the dollar even though it is one of the bigger states. The play told the story of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive and chief accountant. The audience comprised mostly young people from banks, insurance companies and business houses who went to the theatre after work. There was a fantastic atmosphere of excitement in the theatre. At the end of the play the chief character, Jeffrey Skilling, the accountant who organised the tricky things to inflate the books of Enron to make it a bubble company just like our bubble economy, is in an orange jumpsuit and is obviously in jail where he will spend a lot of time. One could feel in the audience a massive wave of emotion because the outcome in Ireland, which is a result of the way we have run this crony capitalism, is unimaginable. That is the problem. There is no Madoff or Enron and Jeffrey Skilling moment in Ireland. The lords of misrule have their houses in Marbella and their little tax boltholes in Switzerland. They are around the world. They are in the pricier parts of Connecticut and New England, starting afresh or else they come back for the odd match and so on like our tax exiles. [233]Our tax exiles do not merit a little note in the four year plan. It is the little people who have to give and who will take it on the chin while the people who lectured us and continue to do so have the luxury of not having to do their share of the heavy lifting. What is the attitude of the Irish negotiators to the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the IMF? I, like many Irish people, had a very strange experience recently, which Deputies can try themselves. I have been texting people because I have been doing a lot of work in examining the IMF and how its structures work. When I type 'IMF' into predictive text what word comes first? The word 'God.' Of course we have to have a rescue plan. We need rescuers and helpers but we also need to be emotionally, mentally and intellectually tough in the negotiations. I look at the sorry set of Ministers, who are mostly feeling sorry for themselves and not the rest of us. I see real emotion and pain etched on many faces but in many cases it is for themselves. I wonder about their capacity to negotiate a tough deal on behalf of this country. Some people in the Department of Finance, and probably the Minister for Finance, have been hanging out a little bit too long and familiarly with Jean-Claude Trichet. I have listened to him and others speaking in Dublin. As a country, of course we have made terrible mistakes but if they think they can make Ireland a poster child for punishment by international finance agencies by destroying this country with terms of negotiation which are impossible to deal with, like the Germans after the Treaty of Versailles they will rue the day and set a bad example for the eurozone. They need to pause because Ireland will not be able to pay these debts. I wish to tell the men from the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission that Ireland needs money at cheap rates of interest if it is going to have a chance to pay back, which Irish people wish and are committed to doing, the sort of financial advances which are being made to us. We can apologise for having a Government which has dealt so ineptly with the blanket guarantee. I am sure the IMF is appalled to find that the room for manoeuvre in regard to the bondholders is probably very limited because of the blanket bank guarantee. On the statement yesterday on the four year recovery plan, what is the ghost at the feast? What is the ghost, like Hamlet’s father, stalking the perimeters of the plan? The ghost is the banks and the bank debts which are on our shoulders. I ask people in the eurozone not to make this a four or five act tragedy. 2 o’clock Act one was Greece, act two is Ireland, act three may be Portugal and, worst of all for the strategists in the eurozone, act four could be Spain. We need a serious discussion about this. People in Europe may say: 'Who is a Member of the Irish Parliament, given the state in which the country is, to even dare to question us?' Solidarity is a founding principle of the European Union and the Union I support and it is a two-way street. Mrs. Merkel made a very good point in regard to bondholders bearing part of the debts. She clarified those statements to refer to the time after 2013. However, what Mrs. Merkel had to say on that is essentially sensible and reasonable in that if a bank collapses not only the shareholders, who in Ireland lost their shirts, but the bondholders, who are risk takers, should share in the losses. I heard people here complain that Mrs. Merkel’s statement fluttered the bond markets. The difficulty with the bond markets is that if one says there will be pain for them, they will react by repricing up the interest rates on one’s debt. They are the epitome of market forces — market forces red in tooth and claw. Many of those market forces are prepared to take a punt on the destruction of the euro and are probably making an awful lot of money. They made an awful lot of money on Greece and I am quite sure there are people counting the hundreds of millions of euro they made on Ireland. They are stalking the eurozone to see where they can strike next. [234]It is time for the people in charge of the eurozone to think about strategies that not only maintain countries like Ireland, but maintain the eurozone because unless they can do both, the eurozone will have a very problematic future. Up to the current debacle, the eurozone, on balance, has actually been good for Ireland. I refer to the interest rates. The United Kingdom and the Swedish finance minister mentioned rates of 3%. The IMF normally lends at rates of approximately 3. 2%. These are the kinds of rates of interest Ireland requires in terms of its debt. Ireland also needs to spread some of this over a longer period. The Labour Party has staked a position which is not popular with Fianna Fáil, the Green Party or the former Progressive Democrat. I know it is under consideration by Fine Gael. If one frontloads too much austerity, one gets this momentary approval from the markets around the frontloading of the austerity. The difficulty is that the frontloading of the austerity, if it is accompanied by penal rates of interest, will sink the country. If the same is done in other countries in this three or four act tragedy of the peripheral countries, there will be a fifth act which will be the destruction of the euro. Let us pause to think about what is not only in Ireland’s interest, but in the mutual interest of the eurozone and the euro as a currency. I move to the contents of the report. People have spoken to me about one of the suggestions in the report in regard to labour market reforms. There will be a 10% reduction in pay for new entrants to the public service. The Government and all the parties in this House should clarify at, or after, the next election that it includes Deputies and the incoming Government. That is my view which many of my party colleagues share. It is something about which people must think but one cannot load pain on young people coming into the public service and then say that the people at the top of it are, somehow or other, exempt from it. I agree there needs to be measures in the social welfare system which encourage people to get back to work. One cannot have a system where young people are encouraged to see life on the dole as some kind of permanent position. When the Labour Party was last in government, I was a Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare. We created the back to work scheme and a series of returns to health, education, training and work in the community. Much of that was done away with during the years of the Celtic tiger. The feeling among agencies like FÁS was that the people on the unemployment register were somehow unfit for work. We must change all of that. We have extraordinarily well qualified people on the register, many of whom have fine professional qualifications. The challenge for us and the smart economy, which is mentioned in the plan, is to think smart about how those people can contribute. We have suggested graduate internship schemes and various return to work experience schemes. All those options must be activated. We have suggested rents should be reviewable downwards as well as upwards. There is a hint of that in the plan but it is not spelled out. The Government has refrained from spelling out the details of the tax and pension changes. I was in a debate not so long ago with the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I talked about property-based tax breaks being capable of producing €800 million in savings over a couple of years. As he does, the Minister got a bit annoyed and said he had advice from the Attorney General that this was impossible. I am glad the winding down of tax breaks has finally been acknowledged and included in this document. That is a bipartisan move on the part of the Government which I welcome. [235]There must be a new kind of bipartisan politics in which there is robust debate. Some of the Ministers who have been in government for 13 years must acknowledge that the monopoly on wisdom is not held by Fianna Fáil and that Fianna Fáil must yield to others and acknowledge that our ideas have merit. After all, we advised Fianna Fáil correctly on the bank guarantee. For its own reasons, it did not accept that advice. People in Ireland can be very robust in their opposition to any or all of the measures. That is a democratic right. However, I plead with people not to be photo fodder for some of the international media stalking Dublin and various buildings. Ireland is not just ghost estates and piebald ponies left to run in fields, even though those images are appealing. In Greece, the impact of the violence that occurred has been to really damage its tourism trade. Tourism is a really important earner in this country and it will help it to recover. I appeal to people in some of the smaller political organisations — I know some people are mad as hell and do not want to take anymore — not to be used as photo fodder presenting the worst imagine of Ireland. There are good things about Ireland. We are in a difficult place but we have great people and we will recover. Our Administration is acting like the Hoover administration in the Great Depression. We need a Rooseveltian administration which will produce a New Deal for this country and will help it to recover.",25/11/2010,30,2568,2569,Ministers who have been in government for 13 years must acknowledge that the monopoly on wisdom is not held by,Fianna Fáil,and that Fianna Fáil must yield to others and acknowledge that our ideas have merit After all we advised Fianna,Fianna Fáil,4156116_19,,Ministers who have been in government for 13 years must acknowledge that the monopoly on wisdom is not held by Fianna Fáil and that Fianna Fáil must yield to others and acknowledge that our ideas have merit After all we advised Fianna,Ministers who have been in government for 13 years must acknowledge that the monopoly on wisdom is not held by and that Fianna Fáil must yield to others and acknowledge that our ideas have merit After all we advised Fianna,text185,0,2,0,0,40,0.05,2,1.609437912,0.040235948,-0.079056942,-0.001976424,0.754754755,0.786786787,0.851851852,0.807807808,0.231231231,0.243243243,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1136497,625,8,93,Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 14—General (Resumed).,25/04/1963,Mr. Noel T. Lemass,Fianna Fáil,Dublin South-West,"I am making a suggestion. It was irresponsible and the only reason I can think of for it is that it was either irresponsibility that prompted Deputy T. F. O'Higgins to go up there and apparently allow the statement to go to the Press before the provisions were announced in the House, or else there must be some smell in the front benches that he did not like, having been there himself once as Minister for Health. As I said before, the Labour Party approve of the amount of money we proposed to raise in the Estimates. They voted for the raising of that amount. The amount was subsequently increased by the provision of additional social services and it can be said that the one tax they voted against was that which provided the money for these services. They have criticised one tax but they have not told us whether or not they approve of the corporation profits tax. They steer away from everything except this turnover tax which is expected to yield £3½ million in the current year. The social services will cost £700,000 more, pensions £120,000 more and the new children's allowances will take £1,200,000. This was expenditure that had to be faced and if we were to raise the money the Labour Party told us we should raise, naturally we must follow the Fianna Fáil policy as it has been followed over the years and see to it that the social service classes are not too badly hit by the raising of this money, the spending of which had the approval of the Labour Party. There are a few other matters I should like to refer to and which the Minister might deal with when he comes to reply. One relates to the turnover tax and the list of exemptions. I do not know whether the Abbey Theatre is included under the heading of education or not. I have certain [525] doubts as to whether it is, but I think it is quite obvious that the Abbey Theatre, which is subsidised by the State, should be exempt from this tax because if it is included, it will cost money first, to collect the tax and then to give it back again with the other hand. That is a matter the Minister might think about when considering the final draft of the Finance Bill. A number of Deputies have been confused regarding the turnover tax. They are confusing it with the purchase tax as applied in Britain and say it will mean a penny on the lb. of butter. The price of butter cannot be increased by the retailer without the permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Prices Act of 1958, which includes four items including bread and butter. The retailer, if he wants to make up this 2½ per cent, will have to do so on sales other than the four items mentioned in the 1958 Act.",25/04/1963,17,228,229,if we were to raise the money the Labour Party told us we should raise naturally we must follow the,Fianna Fáil,policy as it has been followed over the years and see to it that the social service classes are not,Fianna Fáil,1136497_1,,if we were to raise the money the Labour Party told us we should raise naturally we must follow the Fianna Fáil policy as it has been followed over the years and see to it that the social service classes are not,if we were to raise the money the Labour Party told us we should raise naturally we must follow the policy as it has been followed over the years and see to it that the social service classes are not,text104,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0.09486833,0.002371708,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.57957958,0.555555556,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2805990,394,9,132,"Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed).",07/12/1995,Mr. Michael Finucane,Fine Gael,Limerick West,"I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill. As a member of the Mid-Western Health Board I thank him for the tremendous improvements carried out in Limerick Regional Hospital. The £20 million expansion announced by him is very much needed in the hospital. His work is as appreciated in other areas as it is in the Mid-Western Health Board area. I have a specific interest in this Bill as I was a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies when it [853] examined the VHI in detail. Some of the deficiencies identified at that time have been rectified in the Bill. As Deputy Kavanagh said, the committee felt at the time that the board was much too small with five members. I, therefore, welcome the proposal to increase the membership to 12. Given the rapid changes in the health care sector, it is extremely important to ensure that the proper professional personnel are at the top level to guide the VHI into the future. Reference has been made to the increased cost of health care. It is recognised that we have an ageing population, which gives rise to increased costs in the health area. In addition, the use of expensive sophisticated technology also gives rise to increased costs. In recent years an additional burden has been placed on the health service, that is, the high cost of insurance for medical practitioners, be they doctors in general practice or surgeons. As in America, there has been an increase in medical litigation and local GPs talk about the escalating cost of insurance which is essential to protect them and their clients. Deputy O'Malley and I referred some years ago to the VHI's resistance to giving recognition to new private hospitals in the mid-west region. Various packages were prepared with regard to the principle of establishing a private hospital in the area and it would appear these have been resisted by the VHI at all stages. I understand another proposal is being prepared but it will never get off the ground if the VHI do not provide funding for those who avail of that facility and do not recognise the hospital afterwards. In the Mid-Western Health Board area many VHI members may decide not to go to the local regional hospital but to avail of facilities in private hospitals. They will rightly say they are playing an enhanced membership rate in order to provide for that. We have a private facility in Barrington's Hospital where there are a number of consultants who, in many cases, refer their patients [854] to the regional hospital. In other cases the regional hospital may not have the required specialist services available and they refer those patients to various private hospitals in Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin. This is unfortunate because in the Mid-Western Health Board area there is a population over 310,000 people, many of whom are VHI members. A segment of the population are disenfranchised in comparison with other parts of the country. Perhaps the VHI will address that issue, especially in view of the competition which may arise in the future if others come into this market. It is extremely important that community rating should continue. We cannot have new health care companies coming in to the Irish market and creaming off the younger segment of the population, with fewer inherent risks, quoting an unrealistic rate and not necessarily conforming as we would wish. It is important if any health care company wishes to operate in the Irish market that it establishes a profile on age structure and the type of populations etc. which the VHI have to contend with in framing their premiums. Most politicians encounter situations where because of changed circumstances, probably due to redundancy, a person who was part of a group membership in VHI may decide some months later for economic reasons not to continue their membership. When they get a heart attack or some other serious illness they realise the importance of VHI membership which they no longer have. In many cases such people are not eligible for a medical card, yet cannot afford VHI membership. A segment of the community is trapped in that position. I have encountered many instances of hardship concerning people who were members for many years but, because of changed economic circumstances, are no longer members of the VHI. Having approached the VHI regarding the merits of their cases I have found it to be tolerant. In other cases there may be difficulties in regard to giving some concession or honouring [855] their long time membership. There is a segment of the population which is not eligible for a medical card and which the VHI does not cover. I ask the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister the case of a VHI member who is admitted to hospital and has an accident there which may prolong their stay by a further couple of weeks. I would not expect the VHI to be liable for an accident which happened in the hospital. I will illustrate this by giving two examples. One is the case of a VHI member who was hospitalised for tinnitus and was put on a trolley, left unattended and fell off and had to go to an orthopaedic hospital for three weeks. Having been admitted to hospital for tinnitus this person came out badly bruised and injured as a result of their experience in the general hospital. I am still awaiting a full explanation from the hospital. Last week a person was admitted for dialysis, for which, I understand, a certain amount of supervision is required as the person may be weak afterwards. The person fell and had to get 15 stitches. One can imagine the frustrations of people who are admitted to a health care environment and come out worse than when they were admitted. Most of these people are VHI members. I do not think the VHI is liable. The health board should share whatever costs are incurred. Those two examples left me rather bemused by the health care system. Those of us who are members of the VHI appreciate the protection it offers. If we contrast the health care system here with that in the United States we have a fair system. Medical card holders do not have to wait as long as in the past for cataract and hip operations due to Government decisions regarding waiting lists. People who have had a cataract operation are very happy with the outcome and are full of praise for the health care system. People who are not eligible for the medical card system may avail of the VHI, but some are unable to afford it. [856] Some take a gamble in the hope that nothing will happen. Does the VHI provide a simple package where, in tandem with the health board, it caters for a person who is not eligible for a medical card to ensure they do not have the worries associated with illness at a later date? I welcome the Bill, which is a step in the right direction. The VHI, because of the great work it has done, needs to be protected from competitive forces. If the market place is fair, if competition is fair and if whoever comes into the Irish market can operate on the same terms, the VHI will prosper and flourish into the future.",07/12/1995,27,106,107,examined the VHI in detail Some of the deficiencies identified at that time have been rectified in the Bill As,Deputy Kavanagh,said the committee felt at the time that the board was much too small with five members I therefore welcome,Deputy Kavanagh,2805990_1,0,examined the VHI in detail Some of the deficiencies identified at that time have been rectified in the Bill As Deputy Kavanagh said the committee felt at the time that the board was much too small with five members I therefore welcome,examined the VHI in detail Some of the deficiencies identified at that time have been rectified in the Bill As said the committee felt at the time that the board was much too small with five members I therefore welcome,text10,2,2,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.323323323,0.323323323,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3119053,749,6,184,Private Members' Business. - Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors: Motion.,10/05/2000,Ms. Liz McManus,Democratic Left,Wicklow,"I welcome the motion that has been moved tonight by Fine Gael, which is warmly supported by the Labour Party. In his speech, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe began by stating – and I will paraphrase what he said – that if we did not have so many patients there might not be a problem. I have heard of passing the buck, but that is really stretching it to the limit. After three years of this Fianna Fáil/PD Government, it is interesting somebody from the Government back benches essentially discovering that there are problems in our hospitals and that the dispute that is threatening from the NAHD is symptomatic of those very serious problems. I would like to remind Deputy O'Keeffe that the Government was elected to tackle the waiting lists. In that regard he is right – there are now more patients on the waiting lists than when the Government took power three ago. That is not the patients' fault, however. It lies fairly and squarely with the Government. The Minister's speech was startling in that it contained glowing comments about the employers – the HSEA. His sentiments are not shared by the non-consultant doctors, who have experienced extreme frustration and are now reaching breaking point. The IMO must make its own decision, and I respect that, on the proposals which have been outlined tonight. However, it is very damaging to say that this dispute is largely about the refusal of the HSEA to honour the current contract. If one tries to build a relationship based on trust, that track record is a serious impediment. Indeed, more may well be required of the Minister. Time will tell if he is doing enough. I hope he is but I do not have the confidence to say that this will be enough. He will be tested as to whether he can live up to his own rhetoric. If he does not do so, yet again a crisis is looming in our hospitals that will have profound effects. The health system is already under serious pressure. The crisis is not being caused by some natural disaster or a new epidemic it is a man made crisis. The Minister must bear responsibility for the fact that this matter has not been dealt with. He appears incapable of dealing [1360] with the problem and we have a hospital management structure that has proven itself incapable of dealing with it. This crisis is preventable and curable, yet all the signs so far are that it will, if anything, deepen in the coming days. Non-consultant hospital doctors have declared their intention of taking industrial action from next Wednesday. Time is running out. They have voted to do so not by a margin but by a landslide 92% of those balloted voted for industrial action. Yet again we are seeing health workers doing what goes against their professional commitment to patient care but who are being forced, out of desperation, to take industrial action in defence of basic improvements in their working lives. There is a terrible sense of déjà vu about this strike. The hospital service has still to fully recover from the effects of the biggest industrial action in the history of the State. Last October the nurses action lasted nine days. Its impact was unprecedented, both in terms of its effect on our hospital services and in terms of the sustained public support for the righteousness of the workers cause. Now that non-consultant hospital doctors are due to take industrial action, the public is entitled to answers as to why the Government has done nothing effective, so far, to prevent it. The public knows only too well how indebted we are to junior hospital doctors. Anyone who has to attend a hospital can attest to the commitment and hard work of nurses. It is worth noting, however, that public recognition of the essential work of young doctors is equally well grounded. We have the good fortune of having excellent people working in and committed to our hospital service. The Government, however, seems intent on forcing those health professionals out of the hospital and onto the street before they can have their legitimate grievances addressed. When the threat of a nurses strike became known last year it was understood by everybody that a deal would be struck. The only question was would the deal be struck before a strike or after the damage was done. The same inevitability is now coming into play in the case of this action being taken by young doctors. Again there is no doubt that a deal will be struck. The only question is will the Government have the wit, energy, commitment and good sense to provide a sound solution before the day of reckoning dawns. It may be that the Government is incapable of learning from experience. It may be that the new Minister is at heart no better than the last Minister for Health and Children or it may be that this Government is so punch-drunk from the sordid revelations that are tumbling out of the Flood tribunal that all its energies are concentrated on damage limitation measures and on holding the frail edifice of this Coalition together instead of tackling the problems of our health service. This is a test and so far the signs do not look good. Exactly a year ago – 11 May 1999 – I [1361] raised the plight of non-consultant hospital doctors in this House on the Adjournment. This coincidence only reinforces the serious lack of progress made over the last year on the issue of doctors pay and conditions. On that occasion I drew on statements made by the Irish Medical Organisation that itemised the points at the heart of this issue, which have been repeated in the Minister's statement. They include excessive hours of work, pay, unrealistic rostering, on-call duties and the distribution of duties between junior and senior doctors. These issues were known about a year ago when they were outlined by the IMO. Twelve months later the problems, if anything, have become worse. We all know of doctors who are working over 100 hours a week, yet a year ago the IMO stated clearly that rostering doctors for more than 65 hours a week is dangerous to the physical health of NCHDs and has the potential to retard both the development of a quality health care system and to give rise to malpractice claims by patients. The IMO could not have spelt it out more clearly. The practice of exploiting young doctors in training is dangerous to patient care. One year on, the Minister and his Department have not moved on the issue. That is why the junior hospital doctors voted for industrial action in overwhelming numbers. One year later, the employers organisation, the HSEA, has proved to be as intransigent as ever. At the time I outlined the reality for young doctors as follows: What this means is that doctors can and do end up working an intolerable number of hours. Indeed, there is evidence of doctors working up to and even over 100 hours a week. Regularly, junior hospital doctors do not get proper coffee breaks or even a chance to eat lunch. They may head into a day's work having been on call the night before and, following a day's work, having had only two hours sleep. If they want to take a holiday they have to make reciprocal arrangements with colleagues by providing cover for them. If someone is sick another doctor has to fill the gap. The current blanket exemption from the protection of the EU directive on working time for these doctors is unacceptable and poses an unjustifiable risk to patients. It is only a matter of time before a major medical error is made by some unfortunate junior hospital doctor suffering from exhaustion. That is the nightmare of which junior doctors are conscious on a daily basis and one that must be addressed within the shortest time-frame possible. It is unacceptable that any worker, but particularly workers who are dealing with matters of life and death, should be deprived of their legal right to rest breaks or minimum hours. We do not make the demands on lorry drivers or factory workers that are currently being made on junior hospital doctors manning our acute hospital services. [1362] How relevant those words are still. On behalf of the Labour Party, I subsequently published a Private Members' Bill entitled the Protection of Patients and Doctors in Training Bill, 1999. This was done out of our concern for the plight of these doctors. While some climb down was made by the Government on the EU directive, the difficulties experienced by doctors were not addressed over the past year. We now have coming to a head a crisis that was forewarned by the doctors. It is well known that we have a shortage of nurses and that this is having a major impact on service delivery. In an article by Dr. Mick Molloy published last month by the IMO, important points were made about a pending shortage of young doctors, which the Minister disregards at his peril. That Irish graduates are haemorrhaging from our health system has been, to an extent, disguised by the entry of non-national doctors. Standards set by the Medical Council have had an impact on this ready source of manpower. However, a further point made by Dr. Molloy is that Irish graduates are increasingly, and at an earlier grade, being attracted to Britain and the US by shorter hours, better working conditions and better training and promotion prospects. We cannot afford to continue to lose our highly skilled doctors because the Government and the Minister cannot get their act together. Dr. Molloy's prescription includes a ministerial body to be set up to deal with issues of retaining Irish doctors and attracting foreign doctors, as well as modernising the present system of training of doctors, which we recognise is serving neither those working within the service nor those availing of it. Does the Minister intend to take the doctor's advice on this matter or is he still depending on the outcome, whenever that will be, of the protracted deliberations of the medical manpower forum? There is a crying need for reform of the training structures for doctors and for a widening of the numbers of consultants employed to create a specialist provided service instead of the current consultant led one. This Government has resources undreamed of by any previous Government, yet its failure to tackle the needs of health care has been absolutely dismal. Despite the increase in funding, all the Government has succeeded in doing is to increase the numbers on hospital waiting lists. Instead of the root and branch reform that the service so badly needs, we have pious aspirations from the Minister. While we expect a certain amount of pious aspirations from Ministers, we also have glib dismissal of serious proposals that set out to achieve the twin great aims of excellence and equality in health care In particular, I am talking about the major proposal published by the Labour Party, which outlines in detail a substantial framework for the future of the health service. According to A. Dale Tussing, the eminent health economist who has studied both the Irish health system and international models: [1363] There are two currents in healthcare reform in Europe and North America. One group of reformers seeks to address inequality of access to healthcare and seeks a level playing field, removing artificial distinctions based on income or social class. Another group of advocates seeks more allocational efficiency in the delivery of medical care and uses decentralization and market solutions as the principal device for achieving it. The Labour Party discussion document, 'Curing Our Ills', focuses on the former set of goals but, in the bargain, manages to address and achieve the latter as well. It is a 21st century document. Despite this endorsement from a very eminent man, the Minister has refused to even discuss the ideas we have published. Fortunately, others in the health services have been enthusiastically engaged in the process of debate. The Minister badmouths our proposals without having any serious proposals of his own to solve the central problems in health care – the requirements of excellence and equality. He spreads misinformation instead of delivering reform, in which he is ably assisted by his Cork batman, Deputy O'Keeffe. Meanwhile, patients suffer and die unnecessarily because they cannot get into hospital. Some of those who have made it into hospital are being put at risk because of the enormous stress on young doctors in training. That these young doctors are now taking action to protect their patients is to their great credit. What is shameful is that the Minister for Health and Children has not yet taken the definitive action needed to resolve this dispute in the interests of patient care.",10/05/2000,28,1956,1958,efficiency in the delivery of medical care and uses decentralization and market solutions as the principal device for achieving it,The Labour Party,discussion document Curing Our Ills focuses on the former set of goals but in the bargain manages to address and,The Labour Party,3119053_5,,efficiency in the delivery of medical care and uses decentralization and market solutions as the principal device for achieving it The Labour Party discussion document Curing Our Ills focuses on the former set of goals but in the bargain manages to address and,efficiency in the delivery of medical care and uses decentralization and market solutions as the principal device for achieving it discussion document Curing Our Ills focuses on the former set of goals but in the bargain manages to address and,text591,1,4,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.098612289,0.027465307,0.851838545,0.021295964,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.685685686,0.675675676,0.997997998,0.976976977,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

850576,1014,22,183,"Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill, 1953—Second Stage.",28/07/1953,Dr. James Ryan,Sinn Féin,Wexford South,"They should be looked at. A comprehensive measure is necessary. Whether it should be a nationalised scheme or one on the present basis is something to be decided. I started out with a very strong prejudice, from many points of view, in favour of a nationalised scheme but then I thought to myself that we now have an opportunity of seeing how the scheme is working in a neighbouring country and that it should be possible for us to make up our minds more intelligently after learning what their experience is. My idea in regard to a nationalised scheme was that we should bring it into the social welfare code—having a differential, if you like. I do not want to be thought of as gathering all the [785] ideas I have from the British system but the one man who has written deeply on this matter is Sir William Beveridge. I read what he wrote, as I thought I was bound to do, in view of the fact that I would be introducing a Social Welfare Act in this Parliament. One statement that struck me as very objective was that what should guide us in all things is need—need above all. He said he could not see how the man who is sick and drawing national health insurance needs less than the man who was injured in industry. He said that therefore—in theory, at any rate—both should get the same. But he said that, as against that, a very important consideration was that the man who met with an injury in industry was accustomed to get more and that that was a sort of custom that it was not very easy to get over. Therefore, he came out on the side of recommending that they should get a bit more. Of course, we have been carrying on that here. There is a gap. There is some dispute about what that gap should be, but there is a gap. At the moment, the gap is 26/-for the single man. That is the position at the moment and before this Bill is passed. But a man with a wife and two children would at the moment get only the same for workmen's compensation as he would get for ordinary illness. I was trying to keep this Bill more in line with the social welfare legislation by giving the benefit to the dependents—the wife and the two children—and in that way keeping the gap of 26/- whether he was single, married or had one child or two children. That was my object in putting these payments into the Bill. I am attacked from many sides about that. I am attacked by the Fine Gael Party and told that I am doing an unchristian and uncatholic thing. That is what Deputy O'Donnell said. Deputy Costello said he did not agree with the differential between single and married people. We have it in the social welfare code. We have the differential between the single and married man and between the single man and the married man with two children: they are all different. I do not know why Deputy Costello and Deputy O'Donnell [786] should object to that principle in the workmen's compensation code because, presumably, Deputy Costello and Deputy O'Donnell approved of that principle in the social welfare code when Deputy Norton, as Minister for Social Welfare, brought his Bill before the Dáil. It is not likely that Deputy Costello, who was Taoiseach at that time, disapproved of that principle. Now I am up against a new Catholic principle, namely, that there is a difference between workmen's compensation and national health insurance. I am becoming so befuddled here with Catholic principles from the Fine Gael Party that I do not know where I stand. Maybe they will tell me what that principle is in time. Deputy O'Donnell went further—he said I was advocating birth control. Take workmen's compensation at the moment. If a man is single, he gets 50/- and if he has a wife and two children, he gets 50/-. I propose to give more for the wife and children. Surely that is not advocating birth control. Deputy O'Donnell wants me to leave it at the 50/- and surely then I would have more reason to say to him that he was in favour of birth control. But again there is some Catholic principle behind this that I do not understand and I shall have to get more enlightenment on it before I can deal with it further.",28/07/1953,14,643,644,Party that I do not know where I stand Maybe they will tell me what that principle is in time,Deputy O'Donnell,went further-he said I was advocating birth control Take workmen's compensation at the moment If a man is single he,Deputy O'Donnell,850576_7,,Party that I do not know where I stand Maybe they will tell me what that principle is in time Deputy O'Donnell went further-he said I was advocating birth control Take workmen's compensation at the moment If a man is single he,Party that I do not know where I stand Maybe they will tell me what that principle is in time went further-he said I was advocating birth control Take workmen's compensation at the moment If a man is single he,text86,0,3,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.945910149,0.048647754,0.093704257,0.002342606,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.937937938,0.884884885,0.575575576,0.551551552,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
926071,277,8,48,Committee on Finance. - Resolution No. 10—General (Resumed).,16/05/1956,Mr. Liam Cunningham,Fianna Fáil,Donegal East,"The opening paragraph of Deputy MacEntee's Budget statement in 1952 indicated that measures were to be taken to deal with the situation which had then arisen. The matters which were to be remedied included, amongst others, a large deficit in our balance of payments. It is true to say that the opening statement by the present Minister ran along somewhat similar lines. In Volume 130-131, which dealt with the debate then, the present Minister, who was then Deputy Sweetman, was reported as saying that the result of that Budget would be to create a deflationary tendency in the country. Deputy Dillon, when speaking to-day, said that, as a result of the policies adopted in 1952 which created inflation, the present Government and the Fianna Fáil Government since 1952 have been grappling with a balance of payments problem and with an inflationary problem. That is typical of the Coalition Parties and the Coalition Ministers. They cannot agree, and a lot of our trouble to-day is caused by the contradictory views expressed by different Ministers. A good deal of the mess in agriculture to-day is caused by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce expressing different views and propounding different policies. We find that the present Government, the present Ministers and the Coalition Deputies, are very loud in their praise of the Minister for the steps he has taken. One would think that it is the first time in this country that we have experienced a large deficit in our balance of payments. The fact is that, in 1951, we had a deficit of a similar order and whereas it is good to-day to superimpose taxes, and heavy taxes, on commodities which were then taxed and in respect of which there has been no reduction in taxation since 1952—we had the same commodities in 1952 and added to those are similar punitive taxes—they are deemed to be all right to-day because they are introduced by a Coalition [523] Government. They were not all right then. Taxation of a lesser degree was not all right then although we sought to remedy a situation which was in every way similar to that which exists to-day. The only difference between the situation in 1952 and the situation to-day is that the situation in 1952, which began to operate in the first year of Fianna Fáil's return to office, was caused by the Coalition Government of 1951. It operated during the Fianna Fáil term of office. To-day we have, unfortunately, similar evils existing created by a Coalition Government with remedies applied by a Coalition Government, the very same remedies that were applied in 1952. We have the Minister for Agriculture appealing to the Fianna Fáil Party to assist and not to sabotage the efforts which are being made to deal with these ills, while in 1952 we had every device known to the various Coalition Parties brought into operation to break down the then Government. They were successful, very successful. The Minister for Agriculture to-day said that the Fianna Fáil Party was hoping that any loan for which subscriptions would be sought during the year would not be forthcoming. That is not true. Yet that is the same Minister who said in 1952 that any broken-down banana republic, anywhere in the world, could find £10,000,000 at 5 per cent. It just shows the absolute irresponsibility and dishonesty of the present Government. The Minister for Agriculture also said that Deputy de Valera, when speaking yesterday, tried to sabotage the effort which was being made by the Government to get increased production from agriculture. He said that Deputy de Valera indicated yesterday that there was a falling off in agricultural production because suitable incentives were not being offered by the Government. The Minister for Agriculture said that Deputy de Valera should indicate to the Government how much should be paid for milk, how much should be paid, for wheat and how much should be paid for barley. I am saying, now, and it [524] was said by Coalition speakers when they were in opposition, that that is the Government's job. It is the job of the Minister for Agriculture, now that he is considering the price which will be paid to the farmers for their milk, to decide on an equitable price. That is the attitude which was adopted by Coalition speakers when they were on this side of the House. It is the duty of the Government and the duty of the Minister for Agriculture to make up their minds what the price should be and it is the duty of the Minister to seek from the Government authority to pay that price. He cannot run away from his responsibilities as Minister for Agriculture. If it is the policy of the Government to get increased production from our farmers no Minister for Agriculture can run away from his responsibilities in that regard. It would be very convenient for the Minister for Agriculture if Deputy de Valera were to say that we should pay 1/6 or 1/9 or 2/- per gallon for milk. Then the Minister could say: 'Do not blame me blame Fianna Fáil.' He is not going to have it that way. He is going to make up his own mind as to what the price should be for all commodities produced on our farms. He is going to be the one responsible. He is the one who must seek governmental sanction in any action he may take in fixing prices. If there are any consequences, good or ill, of that action, it is the Minister for Agriculture, and the Government, who must take those consequences, be they good or evil. The arguments used in 1952, which were based on the fact that higher taxation was being imposed, indicated that the Coalition Parties then were of the opinion that that taxation was being imposed for the purpose of preventing people from spending, although it was said that there was no need to prevent the people from spending. It was said that there was no need to curb expenditure and that the taxation was imposed to penalise the Irish people. It was said that there was a credit squeeze. We have heard Deputy Declan Costello saying just now that up to now the Government in this country [525] could not interfere with the banking system. He said that they could not command or direct the banks to take any action, that they could say to the banks that a certain action should be taken, but they could not compel the banks to take that action. Yet a few years ago every speaker stated here categorically that there was evidence to show that the then Government compelled the banks to restrict credit. Nobody will deny that that was stated here. Yet, we have Deputy Declan Costello, who when on this side of the House in 1952, said that there was a deliberate order imposed on the banks, the effect of which was that credit became harder to get and became more expensive, saying to-day that the Government should have some power to control the issue of credit and the rate of interest. He said that such a system had not operated in this country so far but that it should operate. That is the type of argument we get. By some strange mesmerism a man's mentality changes when he leaves this side of the House and goes over there. That is not absolutely true: he must be a Coalition collaborator before that can happen.",16/05/1956,15,452,453,Coalition Government the very same remedies that were applied in 1952 We have the Minister for Agriculture appealing to the,Fianna Fáil,Party to assist and not to sabotage the efforts which are being made to deal with these ills while in,Fianna Fáil,926071_5,,Coalition Government the very same remedies that were applied in 1952 We have the Minister for Agriculture appealing to the Fianna Fáil Party to assist and not to sabotage the efforts which are being made to deal with these ills while in,Coalition Government the very same remedies that were applied in 1952 We have the Minister for Agriculture appealing to the Party to assist and not to sabotage the efforts which are being made to deal with these ills while in,text424,2,2,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,-0.016012815,-0.00040032,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.242242242,0.313313313,0.313313313,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under Fianna Fáil he could not have any means.

I agree that for a [1041] wife whose husband has left her in this plight with children to care for it is very difficult to manage, but the scheme has been improved quite substantially in the last two budgets. This week the Minister for Social Welfare signed a regulation which reduces the waiting period for qualification for a deserted wife's allowance from six months to three months. In addition, the conditions that the wife must prevail on the husband to come back to reside with her and the full onus that was placed on the wife to trace the whereabouts of the husband have been eased in some respects. It is great to see that a while in opposition can stir up the old social conscience. There were many suggestions across the floor of the House this evening about all the improvements that should and could be made but somehow they did not get me.

2458165,1093,8,39,"Financial Resolutions, 1990. - Financial Resolution No. 9: General (Resumed).",22/02/1990,Mr. Dan Wallace,Fianna Fáil,Cork North-Central,"I appreciate the difficulties of Members of the Opposition and I congratulate Deputy Reynolds for his more positive approach and recognition of many of the positive things in the budget. The Deputy's colleagues, particularly former Ministers, were very negative and lukewarm about the budget. These were the only people who were really dissatisfied with the budget. I am glad that Deputy Reynolds at least recognised that there were many good things in the budget and acknowledged the achievements that have been made over the last three years. These achievements were significant considering the situation we inherited from the Fine Gael/Labour coalition. Before we came to office, the people were very despondent about their future. Deputies mentioned emigration, interest rates, unemployment and so on. The legacy of the eighties, during which the Opposition parties were in Government most of the time, underlines the disadvantages we suffered as a result of Government policies. The budget was one of the best and wisest budgets in 20 years. It is a tribute to the Minister and the Government that they achieved a sound balance between economic development and the needs of the less well off in society. It is widely accepted outside of this House that this is a good budget despite the concern expressed by Opposition Deputies. The budget is good for social welfare recipients. There have been significant real increases for a wide range of beneficiaries. The budget has also been good for people at work. People earning less than £60 per week are now exempt from PRSI while retaining full social welfare entitlements. Workers on low pay with families can benefit from the increased child related tax exemption schemes or from improvements in the FIS. Workers earning higher levels of pay will benefit from the reduction in the tax rates from 32 per cent to 30 per cent and from 56 per cent to 53 per cent. The reduction in tax liability will benefit single workers [507] who we are frequently told would otherwise emigrate to countries with more favourable tax regimes. Reading the newspapers prior to the budget one got the impression that commentators were trying to outdo each other in raising expectations in advance of the budget. This is in marked contrast to what prevailed through most of the eighties when the talk was about increasing taxation. There was a succession of commentators competing with each other to give ever higher estimates of how much the Government could afford to give away. Many of these commentators seemed to have forgotten that the poor economic conditions we experienced through most of the eighties were caused by excessive budget deficits and by borrowings to meet current expenditure. This approach is again being advocated by various commentators and pressure groups but we cannot afford to return to the policies of the mid-eighties. It is clear that Fianna Fáil's policies in Government over the last three years have proved to be successful. The central element of their strategy has been the Programme for National Recovery which, generally, has been a success, providing much needed stability to the economy, keeping inflation down, contributing to job creation, tax reduction and special increases in social welfare. All these things will prevent a return to the free for all in industrial relations a few years ago. All those who participate in the programme must be congratulated for their positive approach. There were 41 strikes last year and only two were concerned with basic pay increases. The number of days lost was 41,400 which, with the exception of 1944, was the lowest ever. The programme played a major part in contributing to a growth of 3. 5 per cent in the economy over the last two years and an expected growth of 4 per cent in 1990. The targets set in the programme for job creation have been achieved. Private sector employment is now estimated to have grown, providing between 30,000 and 40,000 jobs over the last two years. This [508] was partly offset by declining numbers in the public sector as part of the Government's necessary reduction in numbers there. There has also been a very welcome reduction in the number of job losses. The number of notifiable redundancies was 13,400, half that experienced in 1984. All this progress further underlines the achievements we have made in co-operation with our social partners. We have all benefited from the provisions of the programme and workers have received a real increase in take-home pay. This budget continues the process begun last year by Fianna Fáil of reducing personal taxation. I should like to refer to media reports that Deputy Dukes is insisting on a commitment to low taxation as his price for participating in an all-party committee on the financing of local government. I call on Deputy Dukes to end this charade of concern for taxpayers. He should stop trying to hold the Government to ransom by setting out pre-conditions for the outcome of the deliberations on the whole area of local government reform and funding. Deputy Dukes also seems to have discovered a new found concern for taxpayers but this is very much out of character with his record in Government. As Minister for Finance in the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in the mid-eighties he presided over a period of unprecedented increases in taxation. This was achieved during a period when that Government, who were elected on a platform of fiscal rectitude, let the public finances go completely out of control. I remember hearing Deputy Dukes being very complimentary to himself because he has been the longest serving Minister for Finance in recent times. Let us look back at his record. The national debt doubled to £25 billion, the debt GNP ratio increased from 94 per cent to 130 per cent borrowings reached £2,145 million in 1986, or 13 per cent of GNP, its highest ever. The budget deficit reached a record of 8. 5 per cent while interest rates went to a high level unemployment grew from 170,000 to 254,000 while the numbers at work fell by 60,000. The [509] economy stagnated, the 25 per cent tax rate was abolished and the top rate raised to 65 per cent. VAT was increased to 35 per cent and there were no special increases above inflation for social welfare recipients. In the context of Mr. Duke's performance in Government his claims of concern for the taxpayer now ring very hollow. He should put aside this pretence and join an all-party committee to consider the situation. Our Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a select committee of the Oireachtas to examine and report on the whole question of local authority funding, structure and function. As a member of Cork Corporation I consider it essential to undertake an examination and set local government on a firm footing. In the past Fine Gael were committed to reform of the Oireachtas and to provide structures whereby Members of the Dáil can make a positive contribution to the management of the affairs of the State. They are given an ideal opportunity here to participate in a committee which will review the whole area of local government. I call on Deputy Dukes and the Fine Gael Party to participate in this review in which they can express their views and work towards an agreed approach instead of trying to pre-empt the views of parties in the Dáil. Deputy Duke's colleagues in Cork Corporation — particularly one of them — wrote a full page article in The Cork Examiner outlining the need for urgent Government reform and calling on the Members of the Oireachtas to get on with the job of bringing in necessary legislation so that local government would continue and perform as it should on behalf of the people. Fianna Fáil are committed to reducing taxation and increasing the numbers at work. In contrast with the last Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, Fianna Fáil have stabilised the national debt, reduced the debt-GNP ratio and reduced the budget deficit to about 2 per cent — or £449 million — the lowest for 40 years. They reduced the standard rate of tax from 35 per cent to 30 per cent in two years, reduced VAT from 25 per cent to 23 per [510] cent and provided a substantial increase for a wide range of social welfare recipients, especially the long-term unemployed. We have not heard about any of these measures from the Opposition. The reduction of VAT will affect a wide range of goods through its reduction of 2 per cent. Every item which a householder uses will benefit from the decrease. These include electrical, non-electrical, household, non-durable and consumer goods, goods for personal use and sports and recreational equipment which is very important as many people have been calling for the removal of VAT from hurleys, tennis racquets, fishing equipment, cameras and many other items. Educational goods such as copybooks, drawing paper, notebooks and pencils will also benefit from the reduction in VAT. The same applies to building materials, marine and medical goods, farm machinery and office equipment. People may not want to hear that but it is the reality of the budget. It will affect everybody and will certainly help employment throughout the community. A central objective of Government policy over the last three years has been to create conditions for sustained economic growth. The growth rate, which was stagnant in the period 1980-86, was 1. 6 per cent of GNP in 1988. It reached 3. 25 per cent in 1989 and it is estimated that it will reach 3. 75 per cent in 1990. This is clear evidence of the success of Government policy. Despite the strict financial pressures on the Government since 1987 they have strongly committed themselves to eliminating poverty and improving the position of the less well off in society. The 1988 and 1989 budgets saw the position of all social welfare recipients maintained with special increases for those on the lowest payments. Unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance beneficiaries received increases in real terms of some 20 per cent over the last two years. The budget takes that progress a big step forward. Apart from more than maintaining the position of all those in receipt of social welfare benefits with a 5 per cent increase, it introduced a wide range of [511] special increases. They include an 11 per cent increase for the long term unemployed, an increase of up to 15 per cent for adult dependants with a new minimum payment of £13. There has been an increase of more than 10 per cent for people on disabled person's maintenance allowance and more than 8 per cent, to a minimum of £53, for widows and other lone parents. I am pleased with the introduction of the new schemes and the extension of existing ones announced in the budget. The introduction of a new clothing allowance will help social welfare recipients to provide for their children's schools and winter clothing. A total of £3 million has been provided for this purpose. The scheme will come into operation in the autumn and, while the details have not yet been announced, it is my hope that it will provide for a fixed payment as a right rather than leaving it as a discretionary payment. It is important that those arrangements are in place as soon as possible. That should be done so that payment can be made in August, before the children return to school. I make the same suggestion in regard to the footwear scheme under which payments can be delayed until as late as November. Then it is too late for those who incur heavy costs with their children returning to school and it is too early for expenditure on food for Christmas. I should like to congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare on listening to the views of his backbenchers and managing to convince his colleagues in Government of the need to deal with these problems. We are all aware of the problems poor families must contend with when their children are returning to school after the summer holidays. They are unable to meet the cost of school books, clothing and footwear. This is the first time a Government have recognised the importance of giving direct financial assistance to parents at a time when they have to face heavy costs. It is important that this should come in the form of a fixed payment. Many of us have seen [512] queues of people at local community welfare offices applying for those benefits. It should not be necessary to do that and it is my hope that the Minister will accede to my request for a fixed payment. From past experiences I am confident that the Minister will ensure that the scheme is streamlined to the benefit of those people. They have many problems to face at that time of the year. A lot has been said by some of the poverty lobby about the failure of the Government to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare. The only specific reference made in this context was about the minimum payment, said to be £60 for a single person and £96 for a married couple. It appears that the substantial progress that has been made by Fianna Fáil in phasing in a wide range of recommendations in that report is being ignored. The first thing to note is that arising out of the budget all long term social welfare payments will be brought up to the interim priority rate set by the commission. At the time of the recommendation the rate was £45 and that is £53 in present day terms. The rate for an old age pensioner ranges from £53 to £65. 50 for a contributory pensioner over 80 years of age. Long term unemployment assistance is being increased to £52, an increase of £15. 20 from £36. 80, which was the rate in June 1988. That represents a substantial increase and it will be of direct benefit to the long term unemployed. Widows, widowers and other lone parents receive from £53 to £60 for a contributory widow over 80 years of age. Among the recommendations implemented are: the establishment of an independent appeals office the extension of PRSI to the self-employed a rationalisation of and an increase in the child dependant allowance and an extension of the free fuel scheme to the long term unemployed. The commission considered that, due to the cost of implementing those recommendations, there were four areas that warranted priority attention. They suggested a significant step to bring the minimum payments [513] within reach of the recommended allowance. That has been done in the budget. They recommended improved child income support, and that has been done in the budget with the lowest payment now at £11 and the number of rates reduced from 36 to 16. We are all aware that with 36 rates the officials had to spend a lot of time calculating allowances. The decision in the budget will remove a major obstacle to streamlining the system. I welcome that move. The commission also recommended a broadening of the social insurance base, and that has been done. They recommended that the self-employed should pay £60 million in PRSI this year. Those moves introduce greater equity in the financing of social welfare and benefit the self-employed and their families. With regard to the delivery of services, major progress has been made. Almost £4. 7 million has been spent on the provision of six new buildings and the refurbishment of a further six buildings in the last two years. This year a further £4. 1 million is being provided to speed up that programme. Members have had complaints from people about the conditions at employment exchanges. It is bad enough that they have to go to those buildings to collect their benefits but it is wrong that they should have to tolerate the poor conditions that exist in them. They are unacceptable in this day and age. I am pleased that the Minister has tackled this problem and that the Government have provided the necessary finance to improve many of the buildings. I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for sanctioning the building of a new employment exchange in Cork. It will provide services for the unemployed and a wide range of other facilities. The Minister has given it an appropriate title, a one stop shop. While major progress is being made in the creation of conditions for economic growth leading to increased employment, we continue to face the problem of having 220,000 people in receipt of unemployment benefit. We should ensure that the resources of the State are directed [514] towards helping the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed. I should like to pay tribute to FÁS who are doing a tremendous job and to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, who had streamlined that service by bringing AnCO, YEA and National Manpower under one organisation. That move was a breath of fresh air and the new organisation is doing great work. However, like Deputy Reynolds, I should like to appeal to the Minister to look at the terms of reference of FÁS. There is no doubt that the over 25s have a problem. Many people under that age are in a position to avail of schemes that older people cannot. I should like to refer to the serious problem that has occurred near my home since the Sunbeam plant was put into receivership. I am very concerned about the future for that industry which employs 475 people. It is unfortunate that it was external problems that led to the factory being put into receivership. It is acknowledged by the local people, the receiver, the IDA, the management of the factory and the unions representing the workers, that the workers have adopted a very responsible attitude since the receiver was appointed. I should like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Finance and those with an interest in Cork city to do everything possible to make the resources of the State available to protect that industry. There is no doubt that there is a future for the industry. It overcame the difficulties it faced in the past and the workers have shown what they are capable of. If one walked through that factory today one would not find any evidence that there is a threat to the jobs of the staff. I appeal to the Government to leave no stone unturned in their efforts to protect the jobs of those people. There are enough unemployment problems on the north side of Cork and if anything were to happen to Sunbeam Wolsey it would have devastating effects. I am making a strong appeal to the Minister to convey to his colleagues this serious situation. In common with many other Members [515] of this House I have had long involvement with various community and self-help groups in Cork. Local people are in a special position to identify the needs of their community, to take action to meet deficiencies and to develop and improve themselves for the benefit of the whole community. Because of this I was very pleased with the announcement in the budget that moneys are being provided to assist local community development initiatives. This is particularly so in the case of the north side of Cork. The project submitted to the EC for European funding under the poverty project failed to secure that funding. The Government have, however, decided to step in and provide co-funding. This Cork project was submitted by the Knocknaheeny support group and the Mayfield enterprise group. It seems to cover the whole of the north side of Cork including Farranree, Churchfield, the Glen and Gurranabraher. I had sought a meeting with the Minister for Social Welfare to discuss how this money will be used and to press for the largest possible allocation for Cork. The north side has been particularly hit in recent years and needs to see a commitment to developing community based projects. This will provide a vital resource for a wide range of activities, with projects for the elderly, young families, the unemployed, single parents and other groups in need of help and support. Allied to this initiative is a special allocation for programmes for women. I would like to see the Minister give special consideration to the requirements of family resource centres. We have a number of such centres in Cork which provide essential services to the women of the area. Unfortunately, there is no regular or adequate source of funding to cover the cost of the excellent services they provide. I will be pressing to get funding for these five family centres, because having worked with them I realise — and it is well recognised in the community today — that we need local people to use their initiative they are closest to the problem. I will be calling [516] for full financial support for the family resource centres in the areas in Cork to which I have referred. There have been wide-ranging and strongly articulated views to the effect that the public finances have been rectified at the expense of those on social welfare. There are equally strongly held views that this is not the case. There have, of course, been some reductions in a proportion of expenditure on certain services. However, expenditure is now being increased. In education additional money has been allocated to meet the needs of schools in disadvantaged areas, an extra £120 million has been allocated to the health services as compared with the Estimate for 1989, a reduction in the net amount required from the taxpayer for social welfare hides the increases in PRSI income from the self-employed and the increased numbers at work as well as the reduction in the number unemployed. A National Economic and Social Council report published in 1988 found that real income from work fell between 1980 and 1987. During the same time the real value of social welfare payments increased, due mainly to the large increases given by Fianna Fáil Governments in 1980-81 and 1982. Since 1987 payments to those on lower social welfare payments — the long term unemployed — have been increased by over 25 per cent with other real increases for recipients. The position of workers, especially those on low pay, has improved in real terms, but not to the same extent as for people on social welfare. Fianna Fáil have always cared for people in need and continue to do so. This budget is clear evidence of that concern. Deputy Noonan, Fine Gael spokesman, was critical that this budget did not do enough for the poor. He was a member of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government which simply kept payments in line with inflation. He showed no initiative in making any special provision for social welfare recipients, something which Fianna Fáil have consistently done in the last three budgets. Likewise, Deputy Spring, Leader of the Labour Party, was critical of the budget for not [517] creating additional jobs. Having listened to some of Deputy Spring's contribution here today, I was amused, because people who were in a position to do so at a particular time, when things were very difficult, made no effort. They did not think of the poor they did not think of the problems of the people they did not think of the unemployed or anybody else. They thought only of themselves. They stayed in power as long as they could, but certainly they did not think of the people out there which we have certainly done in the last three years. Deputy Spring would need to look into his own conscience and be a little more honest about his approach in knocking this budget.",22/02/1990,26,1143,1144,Corporation I consider it essential to undertake an examination and set local government on a firm footing In the past,Fine Gael,were committed to reform of the Oireachtas and to provide structures whereby Members of the Dáil can make a positive,Fine Gael,2458165_7,,Corporation I consider it essential to undertake an examination and set local government on a firm footing In the past Fine Gael were committed to reform of the Oireachtas and to provide structures whereby Members of the Dáil can make a positive,Corporation I consider it essential to undertake an examination and set local government on a firm footing In the past were committed to reform of the Oireachtas and to provide structures whereby Members of the Dáil can make a positive,text99,0,3,0,0,40,0.075,3,1.945910149,0.048647754,0.296730148,0.007418254,0.874874875,0.908908909,0.937937938,0.884884885,0.870870871,0.81981982,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
691195,11,8,139,Vote 61 (Posts and Telegraphs)— Motion to Reintroduce.,08/07/1949,Mr. Frank Aiken,Fianna Fáil,Louth,"The people of this country do not forget everything in 16 or 17 months after it has happened and they know that Clann na Poblachta put up 90 candidates and they asked the people, as they put it 'to give MacBride the reins of Government'. They turned him down 9 to 1. He got 1 candidate back out of every 9 he put up. The people did not elect this Government as a government. They did not know it was going to come into operation and the Independents and some of the smaller groups that supported it supported it because they were afraid of another general election. The Taoiseach is using that fear of a general election on the part of the smaller groups, on the part of the Independents, to whip them through the Division Lobby in favour of the reintroduction of this Estimate which a number of them by their abstention yesterday condemned. In my belief those Deputies are being publicly humiliated. If they were men of honour they would give the same verdict to-day as they gave yesterday. And their fear of an election is not even real. They are being persuaded by the Fine Gael whips that if they do not vote for the Government the alternative is an election. There is another alternative. If the Government lose this second vote, I take it from what the Taoiseach said—if we can rely upon him—that he will resign. [485] Then the course open to the Dáil would be to elect a new Government. There is no Party in this Dáil sufficiently strong to elect a Government of itself, but there are six or seven Parties in the Dáil who could elect a Government if they had not the opposition of the remainder. There is, for instance, the Fianna Fáil Party— if they were allowed to form a Government. If the Taoiseach resigned, if we had had his resignation here this morning, as we should have had according to the Constitution, and if we had not last night got a dissolution from the President, the question we would be discussing here this morning, I take it, would be that Eamonn de Valera should be elected Taoiseach. If any other Party thought that they could form a Government and be able to carry on—that they would not be thrown out, and even that they could carry on for a few months—they could have nominated a new Taoiseach if they did not like to let Fianna Fáil carry on as the Government. Fianna Fáil was entitled on the 18th February, 1948, to have been allowed to become the Government if the Independents and several other of the smaller groups had confirmed the wishes of the people as expressed by their giving Fianna Fáil, the largest Party, a majority over all other organised Parties. However, we have not that situation at this moment. Instead of being engaged in the election of a new Taoiseach to form a Government to carry on the affairs of this State, we have this miserable procedure by which the small Coalition groups and the Independents are going to be humiliated publicly. We all know that if the Independent members and the members of the Labour Party and the other Parties who did not turn up yesterday were asked privately—and they will say it privately all around the country after this Vote—they would say that if they had their will they would not impose this tax on the people who want access to the Government. Dean Swift said at one time—I forget the exact words, but the idea [486] was—that the British Government deprived the Irish people not only of their rights but of their right to protest, to howl, to make themselves heard. The Coalition groups, with the help of the Independents, did deprive the Irish people of the right to have the Government of their choice——",08/07/1949,13,23,25,of this country do not forget everything in 16 or 17 months after it has happened and they know that,Clann na Poblachta,put up 90 candidates and they asked the people as they put it to give MacBride the reins of Government,Clann na Poblachta,691195_1,,of this country do not forget everything in 16 or 17 months after it has happened and they know that Clann na Poblachta put up 90 candidates and they asked the people as they put it to give MacBride the reins of Government,of this country do not forget everything in 16 or 17 months after it has happened and they know that put up 90 candidates and they asked the people as they put it to give MacBride the reins of Government,text547,1,0,0,1,40,-0.025,-1,-1.098612289,-0.027465307,0,0,0.151151151,0.101101101,0.06006006,0.102102102,0.323323323,0.323323323,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"","","","","","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

662553,825,14,19,Adjournment Debate.,06/08/1948,Mr. William Norton,The Labour Party,Carlow-Kildare,"I think it is about the same as last year. I think we adjourned last year from July to October. Mr. de Valera: Is that so? I did not think there was any adjournment of that length. Certainly the Adjournment that took place when we first came into office was considerably shorter. I am not, however, going to find fault with the Government for proposing that delay because I think that the Government, considering the manner of its composition, will require that length of time to adjust the differences that must exist between the various elements of the Government if we are at all to believe their professions when they were before the electorate. Some time ago when a question was asked with regard to the Government's programme, reference was made to the 'ten points'. I have these points [2409] here in front of me as they were published in the newspaper. All I can see in the majority of them is just pious aspirations. The Government say that they are going to seek to implement increased agricultural and industrial production. I do not think there is anybody in this country who would not agree on that as an objective and as a purpose. When I see something like that it reminds me of Poor Richard saying about being 'healthy, wealthy and wise'. We all undoubtedly agree that that is an aim, the achievement of which would merit an effort, but even Poor Richard suggested a method by which it was going to be done. I think we are entitled to demand from the Government that they should show us precisely how they intend to implement this particular objective of increased production. It is by that that we are going to judge them, by the methods that they are going to adopt to bring about this increase in agricultural and industrial production. We hope that the period of the Recess will give them time to settle down to that problem. They are no longer in the position in which they could claim to have been for some time past, just getting to know their Departments. They have behind them a body of welltrained civil servants, men who have been engaged in trying to get the facts of a situation on which decisions have to be made. For a number of years past we were trying to look ahead to the position that would arise when the war terminated and to have, as far as possible, plans ready for meeting the situations that would arise. All that material is ready for the Government. A number of White Papers, as Deputies know, have already been published. The Government have all the information on which decisions have to be taken. We are entitled to expect that when the Dáil reassembles after the Recess we will have something more than mere objectives in front of us, that we will have a reasonably detailed plan as to what exactly the Government propose to do. With regard to production, both agricultural and industrial, there is the question of deciding what is the type of production we are going to have, what is the policy that will be [2410] pursued in the main. Are we to proceed, for instance, in agriculture on the old beef policy and, if we do, how will it fit in with the ideal of trying to maintain as high a rural population as possible and how far will it fit in with what has been accepted generally as the best type for us to follow—the general idea of mixed farming? What steps will be taken in view of the fact that high prices are almost certain to prevail for meat? How are we going to see that that does not result in a relative depression of our dairying industry, and what steps do the Government intend to take so that what is the fundamental part, and what must remain the fundamental part, of our agricultural industry is properly preserved? Most of the problems with which the Government will have to deal, as was pointed out already by a speaker in the course of debates here, will be the question of a very nice balance and a sure judgment as to what particular line should be pursued. During our whole period as a political Party, Fianna Fáil has held—and we hold by it as strongly to-day as at any time previously—that the main aim of our agriculture, its first aim, should be to supply the home market with the food for our own people and to try to supply that at such prices as will make it possible for the community to purchase it. That can only be done by efficient production. We want, then, to see whether the present Government agree with that view and what steps they propose to take so that that aim will be properly achieved. We have, of course, to have exports to purchase the necessary imports. What particular commodities are we to rely on for that purpose? If we are to have exports of an agricultural type it is desirable to get for them the highest possible price, but in achieving that highest possible price we may very well have the situation indicated by the Taoiseach, when he was speaking this morning, that if you rely, for instance, on beef exports and if you get the highest price that is obtainable for those exports, you may create a situation here in which you will have very severe hardships imposed on a [2411] very large section of the community through inability to pay the ruling high prices. What steps do the Government propose to take in order to achieve, if possible, the two aims, to get the highest price that is desirable from the point of view of the export—getting for it the highest return we can get in goods— and at the same time to see that our own people, in times when very high prices can be got for that produce abroad, will not suffer? On the other hand, we should like to know the steps that will be taken to deal with the dairying situation. These are things about which we would expect, when the Government come back after the Recess, they will have something more to tell us than merely to indicate an aim. I repeat that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we believe we ought to use the resources of our land to the utmost extent to feed our own people. That is a good policy under all circumstances and particularly a good policy to meet times of crisis. I wonder whether the present Government will have a similar view. If they have, all we will want is an answer to some of the questions I have already put, and to learn to what extent the attitude which was so frequently expressed by the present Minister for Agriculture when he was in opposition is going to be maintained by the Government. The Minister for Agriculture said last night that there was no position he coveted so much as that of being Minister for Agriculture. I think it is not an unfair inference to draw, that he wanted that position in order to put into practice some of the ideas he has expressed so frequently in public. Is that really going to be Government policy? I think the people are entitled to know. With regard to industrial production, our view was that it was essential for the well-being of this country that we should develop our manufacturing industries to the utmost extent possible. We were quite satisfied that that could not be done without protection. We were a relatively [2412] undeveloped country, so far as manufacturing processes and production were concerned, and it was obvious to us that we could not stand up against the competition of well-organised, powerful industrialised nations such as the United States or Britain, or such as Germany might have been in the past that it was absolutely necessary, if we were not to become simply a grazing ranch that we should develop our manufacturing industries. We wanted to develop them from the point of view of giving employment here, from the point of view of safeguarding ourselves in times of emergency, so that the things that were vital for the well-being of our people would, so far as possible, be produced here and would not have to be imported, under conditions of war, from abroad. To what extent does the present Government adhere to that view? Do they, in fact, hold by that view, and, if they do, what are the steps which they will propose to take and what is the amount of protection they will give? We on our side believe that the amount of protection should be sufficient to induce those who are prepared to enter into industry to go into it, to put their capital into it, and to devote their energies to the development of it, but the situation should be carefully watched so that the privileged position they get, by reason of that protection, will not be abused. I take it that the present Government will, in the main, have the same view, but we are anxious to have more detail. One of our objections, for instance, to the agreement which has just been approved is that we wanted to get in as early as possible the equipment which would enable us to go ahead with that programme and that we are not getting it. It is quite obvious to me, and, I am sure, to every other Deputy, that, if we are to maintain our population here, we will have to proceed rapidly with the development of our manufacturing industries. A commission has been set up, I understand, to examine the facts in relation to emigration. There is, in my opinion, very little need to set up a commission to examine that matter. The facts are fairly well known. What is required is some method by which this drain of our [2413] people can be stopped. The only solution we saw for it was first, to see that as many economic homesteads as possible were established upon the land, to divide up the land into reasonably-sized farms to the extent economically justifiable. Accordingly we want to know what is to be the policy of the Government with regard to land division. We understand that there are 500,000 to 1,000,000 acres of land yet to to be divided, and, as a means of establishing and keeping a rural population, it is obvious that the programme of land division is one which ought to be pursued with all rapidity. I have on a number of occasions been dissatisfied with the progress being made by our Government in that regard. Difficulties were put up by the Department concerned, and particularly the fact that we had a congested area in the West which was crying out for readjustment and that that was a slow process. It is a programme which ought to be carried out now and which ought to take priority over any other, but at the same time it is obvious that, if we want to preserve the rural population and to get into a sound position as quickly as we can, we ought to try to go ahead with our land division programme and establish as many homesteads upon the land as is economically possible. There the question of the size of farms and so on will arise, but it is foolish to think, as I have pointed out previously from the other side of the House and at public meetings, that that, of itself, will stop emigration. It cannot do it. The moment you reach any stable situation on the land, a situation in which the land is divided as much as it ought to be, there is bound to be migration or emigration from the farms. If there are five people in a small farmer's home, only two on the average can remain on the land. Three will have to go off the land and will have to seek employment in the towns or in the countryside, or emigrate. How far can we provide employment for them in the countryside? The difficulty confronting the farming community at present, and particularly in regard to the dairying industry is the difficulty of getting labour. Those engaged in the industry [2414] say that they are not able to pay labour the amount required to keep them in that industry, instead of going on to others or leaving the country and it is obvious that, if we are to preserve the dairying industry, provision must be made to deal with that problem. Will the Government, when they come back, have for us some programme, some line of action which they propose to take, to achieve some of these results and help to stop emigration? The next matter is the matter of housing, and, so far as I can see, there is no difference of opinion as between those on this side of the House and the other with regard to that particular aim. One of the things the previous Government did some time ago was to set up an organisation to deal with constructional work and to see that the building of houses for the people got priority as a prime necessity. Those who are now in the Government accused us of not making rapid progress and we shall be entitled to ask, when they come back, what precisely is the progress they have been able to make which would not have been made had the line of policy which we adopted been pursued. The priorities given were such as to guarantee the building of houses as a first requirement—anything else was relatively trifling. There was a consideration, an important consideration, namely, the building of factories which would give employment and produce. It is a nice balance as between building houses for the people and the necessity of providing work for them. The two things ought to go together. If my recollection is correct, there was a fair priority, a necessary priority, given to the building of houses and next was the priority in respect of building which would give employment and produce the goods required by the community. We will naturally expect to get from the Government, after the Recess, an indication of what they propose to do, or are doing, about this matter of the building of houses. I think they are likely to say that we still have not got all the necessary skilled labour, equipment and materials, the grounds on which they have excused themselves [2415] for lack of progress so far. The same conditions obtained in the previous Government. If they have got into office on the ground that they have cures for these diseases, we are entitled to know what the cures are and exactly the extent to which they are being applied. The next point is the 'reduction in the cost of living.' Everyone would like to see that, but it is not an easy thing to do. You have demands on one hand from labour for higher wages and demands on the other hand for higher prices for produce, both that produced at home and that coming in from outside. We had that difficulty and recognised it as a difficulty. We are entitled to ask the Government, when they come back, having had 15 weeks to adjust their problems and fix their differences, what precisely are the steps they propose to take regarding these particular matters. We will be entitled to criticise them and to question whether the steps they propose are likely to achieve the results they say they have in view. Again, they talk of 'Taxation of all unreasonable profit making.' That was also the aim with us, but it is one thing to have that desire and another to get effective means to secure it. We will not be content, on this side of the House, with pious aspirations. We will expect from the Government a definite programme to secure the results. We can admit that they have these aims in view. Every member of the community would agree with them, except some few individuals who might want to make excessive profits. Therefore, they will get from us and from the community as a whole, support in any measure that will effect those results. That is true for practically every item in the list. We now come to the 'Introduction of a comprehensive Social Security plan to provide insurance.' We have yet to see the complete plan. Everyone knows that a Department was set up and a Minister put in charge, purposely to investigate that problem in a way in which only a Minister could investigate it. A great deal of the preliminary work was done by us before the present Government [2416] came into office. The road was clear and all that is necessary now are the decisions. These decisions will not be easy to make. I do not pretend that the Government has an easy task. My complaint with the former Opposition was that they were talking about all these things as if they could be done by the wave of a wand. We know they cannot, we know that every solution proposed has certain shortcomings and that it will be a question of trying to decide, as wisely as we can, the best course to take to get the maximum benefit for the country as a whole. However, we are entitled to get decisions from the Government in regard to these matters. There is here 'The removal of recent taxes on liquor, etc.' That is a thing that has been done. We admit that, as a point in the programme, it has been done. We do not agree with a number of things which the Government have done in that or in other matters, but at any rate we have no doubt as to the Government's attitude on it. We have as the next one of the ten points 'Immediate steps for the treatment of sufferers from tuberculosis.' We, the previous Government, wanted that also. The steps we were going to take do not differ materially, so far as I can judge since I came home, from those that have been taken. If I am wrong, I would be glad to know it. Steps were being taken by the Minister responsible in our Government to try to deal with that matter. There were difficulties in providing sanatoria owing to the shortage of building and other materials. In the question of using other existing institutions, you had to balance between changing about for example persons who were mentally deficient. Was it right that this should be done? We have next 'the establishment of a council of education.'
