"The appointment of members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is dealt with in section 65 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which provides they are to be appointed by the President on the nomination of the Government and the passage of resolutions by both Houses of the Oireachtas. In making the nomination of a person to be a member of the Ombudsman Commission, the Government is required by the 2005 Act to satisfy themselves that the person has the appropriate experience, qualifications, training or expertise for appointment to a body having the functions of the Ombudsman Commission. On the 3rd February 2009, the Government nominated Mr Dermot Gallagher for appointment by the President to be the Chairperson of the Ombudsman Commission. In making the nomination, the Government was fully satisfied that Mr. Gallagher meets the statutory requirements for appointment as Chairperson of the Ombudsman Commission. The same pro[577]cess was undertaken by the Government in 2005 in relation to the appointment of the original members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Having satisfied itself that the nominees had the appropriate experience, qualifications, training and expertise for appointment to the Commission, Judge Kevin Haugh, Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Conor Brady were appointed by the President on the nomination of the Government and the passage of resolutions by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Question No. 110 answered with Question No. 56.",Brady
"——with which somebody can provide for a family and have some hope of acquiring a home of his or her own, as is right. It is extraordinary that in this Bill Fianna Fáil has used all of the ingenuity available to it, via the parliamentary draftsmen, to include in the remit of the Bill very low paid public servants, including people such as cleaners working on a part-time basis. They will be hit with reductions in pay of a minimum of 5%. However, when it comes to Anglo Irish Bank, the Government has used the powers and cleverness of its parliamentary draftsmen to exclude its staff from such reductions. There has been considerable talk by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance about fairness. As I said in the discussion on the previous amendment, the Minister for Finance has talked about war and said that we were in an economic war. On Sunday night he said that he did not want to open a second front in the war against the public service and he did not want that war to extend to the commercial semi-State bodies. It is very difficult for most people here, including Members of this House, who are taking significant pay cuts and paying pension levies along with all the other people paid out of the public purse to have the people who are largely responsible for the cause of the war exempted by means of parliamentary cleverness. Earlier the Government Whip said:  Nothing in this legislation would prevent the addition of Anglo Irish Bank and the Labour Party has obtained senior legal advices to that effect. This is a conscious political decision by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in government to target nurses, gardaí, clerical assistants and everybody in the public service bar members of the Judiciary — which we have already discussed — and employees of Anglo Irish Bank. Where is the fairness in that for the Minister? Where are Fianna Fáil’s republican credentials for the men of no property when the people at the very top of Anglo Irish Bank, who have had a cap on their salaries of between €300,000 and €500,000 put in place, are to a significant degree responsible for the plight we are in? Where is the fairness and justice in that? If the Government wished, it could seek to extend the remit of the legislation to the other banks because in the various banking legislation dealing with the credit institutions and dealing with the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and NAMA, but particularly in the legislation relating to the covered institutions, the powers of the Minister for Finance are almost completely limitless. In law he is a tsar of the covered institutions. He is even more of a tsar in terms of his control and power over Anglo Irish Bank. Let us remember the Minister has gone around the world claiming that unlike in France and other countries, the public service in Ireland has taken these cuts on the chin, with only small demonstrations and small strikes for a day yet on the other hand there is a major commitment by the public servants themselves and public service union leaders to say they recognise that the economy is in a difficult place and they want to play their part. The Government claims that the only falling out it has had with public servants is over the mechanism by which that burden would be shared by everybody, including public servants. [759]However, what do we find in this legislation? We find that Anglo Irish Bank is excluded. Shame on Fianna Fáil for imposing a cut on nurses, teachers, special needs assistants, doctors, clerical officers, assistant principals, principal officers and Secretaries General, but excluding Anglo Irish Bank. Where is the logic in that? Where is the fairness in that? It is almost as though the Minister for Finance wishes to test the resolve of public servants by trying to find out how much they will take without protesting so that he can go to France and point to the traditions of 1798 and the French Revolution but claim that we do not have that in this country. He can claim that our public servants will take almost anything yet we will exempt Anglo Irish Bank. In France and other countries, even the UK, there has been a serious attempt to impose restraints and conditions on bankers who have transgressed. We are not talking about the bank staff at counter level, many of whom were duped by the leaderships in their banks into putting their life savings into bank shares that are now worthless. We are talking about the top echelons, the Seánies and others in Anglo Irish Bank, who were so friendly with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and who rushed to the Galway tent and every other Fianna Fáil function to say 'There is one motherland and one fatherland'. We have Fianna Fáil on the one hand, and Anglo Irish Bank and the developers on the other hand. This is the golden circle. The Bill protects the golden circle yet again. Many Anglo Irish Bank staff members have lost their savings because they were invested in the bank’s shares. When I questioned him at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, Donal O’Connor, the chairman of the bank told me that people at senior management levels in the bank are heavily compromised because at the height of the property boom they became players and were taking stakes in the bank’s unwise property developments. We read in today’s newspapers — I wish that the Minister could deny it — that the person who has been the internal auditor at Anglo Irish Bank since 2005 has been reappointed to that position. Perhaps that particular auditor consistently blew the whistle internally in the bank but was not listened to by his superiors in the bank. However, it seems extraordinary given that the Government has taken control of this bank. The bank is not permitted by the European Central Bank to lend until next July other than on roll-over projects to developers. So we have a zombie bank and have committed ourselves to €24 billion in NAMA bonds for this bank. We have already invested €4 billion, which we have informed the European Union and the European Central Bank is money that is gone. We are being asked to pony up some time after Christmas — probably in late January — at least another €4 billion and up to €6 billion into a dead bank. As I have said previously, the Labour Party’s reservations about the guarantee centre on two banks, Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society — a tiddlywink building society that is in for €8 billion of rescuing and €2 billion of a cash injection shortly when its special meeting is held. Is the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, serious about excluding the party that has led to the core collapse in the reputation of Ireland internationally? If one follows our bond spreads every day, one will find they are way over what they ought to be. Even with the extreme financial reduction measures we are discussing today, our bond spreads are considerably higher than Italy’s bond spreads because the international bond markets know that we have a mess that we have retained and Fianna Fáil has kept to itself, in Anglo Irish Bank, a bank we are nurturing along and pouring money into as if it were a dead drain. Now we find that nurses and teachers are to bear this reduction in salary while those in Anglo Irish Bank get away scot free. If the Minister said he felt terribly sorry for the young people who went to work in Anglo Irish Bank in the last ten years, worked hard, did what they were told and were not really responsible for the mess, but he would apply the reduction to the higher paid in Anglo Irish Bank — for example, anyone earning more than €100,000 or [760]even €150,000 — I could understand it. One might feel sorry for the staff on the lower levels who were not responsible for what went on. Instead, the top directors, the chairman and everyone else in Anglo Irish Bank are being protected. This Government ought to recognise the difference between right and wrong in terms of governance. This further protection of Anglo Irish Bank is a step too far and the Labour Party is proposing that Anglo Irish Bank be included in the list of organisations to which these provisions will apply. It is owned and totally controlled by the State. The Bill should be amended to include those in Anglo Irish Bank in the measures being inflicted on a range of public servants to reduce their salaries. Professor Honohan yesterday indicated that he would favour a parliamentary inquiry along the lines of the DIRT inquiry, together with an oversight commission, as I suggested during the debate on the NAMA legislation. This would bring in outside experts to tell us what went wrong in this and other banks. What Professor Honohan has to say is welcome. Here is the proof of whether those in Fianna Fáil can recognise financial right from wrong. Why should everybody in the public service take the hit? It is those in the public service, and every other taxpayer in Ireland, who are at the moment paying dearly for Anglo Irish Bank.",Ahern
"I apologise, I knew he had raised another issue. The budget is set for a fixed date in December and the only change we made this year is based on the belief that we can give greater credibility to the budgetary process by laying out a four year track whereby projections for anticipated growth, measures to foster growth and employment and adjustments to expenditure and taxation will be set out in advance of the budget. Furthermore, the end of November returns are an important element in the calculation of the annual budget because they allow for as precise a figure as can be obtained in regard to tax receipts. Deputy Brian Hayes explored the question of reaching the 10% debt to GDP ratio. He rightly pointed out that our current debt to GDP ratio is the highest in the eurozone. However, until August we were able to borrow at attractive rates because the underlying strengths of the Irish economy were recognised by many international investors. These strengths include our robust export performance, flexible workforce and capacity to adjust our wage and price levels and asset values. Above all, we are moving towards a balance of payments surplus notwithstanding the substantial public borrowing required to fund the State. These factors are recognised in international markets and are among the reasons Ireland has been permitted to be an outlier for so long. The fact remains, however, that our current debt level is not sustainable and it is an exercise in judgment as to how far below it we should go. The Deputy referred to the market sources with whom he had discussed the matter but, while I will certainly take account of his, albeit second-hand, opinion, ultimately I will be guided by the NTMA in my assessment. I already outlined the basic undertakings given by the State in respect of the Croke Park agreement. The agreement sets out procedures on a definite slate of items but it also provides a framework for the exploration of other issues.",Hayes
"——and other WTO negotiating partners must make equivalent contributions to ensure that an ambitious and balanced agreement is realised. It is time for realism to prevail at the negotiations with regard to what is attainable and acceptable in respect of agriculture. We must achieve genuine balance in any final agreement. Crucially, the European agrifood sector must not be sacrificed for the sake of a deal. This is the position consistently taken by the Government and it will continue to be strongly reflected at various EU and WTO meetings. My colleagues in Government, my officials and I have taken every opportunity to make our concerns clear to the EU Commission in bilateral contacts and at meetings of the EU co-ordinating groups in Geneva, the Article 133 committee, the Agriculture Council and the General Affairs and External Relations Council. This is not just an Irish concern. I have been engaged for several years in a continuous process of encouraging and cajoling other member states to join Ireland in its strong stance on this issue. I have also been pressing the Commission, both at the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in direct bilateral meetings, to stiffen their backs in the negotiations. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has played a similar leading role at the General Affairs Council. Like his predecessor, Deputy Michael Ahern, the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, has also been active in this intensive effort on the part of the Government. The Taoiseach has taken every opportunity to put forward our case at the very highest level in Europe. This has been a signal to others both of the importance of this issue to Ireland and the need for engagement at the highest levels by European Governments in respect of this matter. We have also established an alliance with a group of over 14 EU member states and there is good support for the view that the legitimate interests of the EU agrifood sector must be strongly defended. At the latest Council meeting the membership of the group of 14 swelled to 20. Of course, each member state has its own particular concerns. While Ireland focuses on the 'Green Box', export refunds and market access for beef and dairy products, others are, for example, concerned about Mediterranean products. However, such broad alliances are crucial in an EU of 27 member states. The Government’s intention is to continue these contacts with other member states and directly with the Commission. This process has been particularly intense in recent times. That [606]will remain the case in the coming months as the WTO Director General, Pascal Lamy, has indicated his intention of calling a ministerial meeting in 2008, with a view to finalising the modalities of an agreement on agriculture and NAMA. The timing of this ministerial meeting is as yet unclear, although dates in April, May, June and even July have been mentioned. The timing is very much dependent on the progress that can be made to resolve the large number of technical issues that remain outstanding. In recent weeks, intensive discussions have taken place in Geneva on the texts. However, there are still many technical, as well as political, issues that have not been resolved. The possibility that further texts might issue from the agriculture and NAMA chairs, before discussions move to a horizontal process at senior official and political level, has not been ruled out. It is not only the timing of the ministerial meeting that is in doubt. A number of WTO members have outlined their opposition to dealing only with agriculture and NAMA at a ministerial meeting and have emphasised the need for progress on other elements of the WTO negotiating agenda such as services, rules trade facilitation, etc. This is in line with the WTO principle of a single undertaking in the negotiations, whereby nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. It is, therefore, unclear at this stage which issues would be addressed at a ministerial meeting. If agreement were to be reached on agriculture and NAMA at this time, the suggestion is that, in the period needed to produce detailed WTO schedules, the other areas of negotiation would be concluded so that the final overall agreement would be in place by the end of 2008. As to the prospects for an agreement this year, it is very difficult to call. In addition to the large number of complex issues across the broad spectrum of negotiating areas that are unresolved, the uncertainty in the US political situation will play a crucial role in whether this proposed timetable for reaching a final agreement is achieved. We must assume, however, that regardless of whether a WTO agreement is concluded this year, sooner or later there will be an agreement. It is important, therefore, that we prepare ourselves for this. Irrespective of the precise substance of such an agreement, it will present significant challenges for the Irish food industry and for the beef sector in particular. As the negotiations continue, and while I am committed to a successful conclusion to the round, I assure the House that the Government is determined to ensure that EU agriculture will not be sacrificed for the sake of an agreement. There must be an equitable agreement which will deal with all elements of negotiation. Ireland and the EU must secure an agreement that will ensure continued economic development. Therefore, my overriding objective is to ensure that the CAP reforms, which have already been implemented and which represent the limit of the EU mandate in these negotiations, are not undermined. I will continue to argue this point forcefully in the negotiations. I have a number of specific priorities in respect of the ongoing agriculture negotiations. On domestic support, I aim to ensure that the system of decoupled direct payments continue to qualify as non-trade distorting payments under the WTO 'Green Box' classification and so remain exempt from reductions under the new round. There can be no question of the decoupled single farm payments being undermined by any WTO proposals for reviewing the 'Green Box'. This is a clear red line for the Government which cannot be crossed in the negotiations. On export subsidies, we want to ensure the full parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidy, while seeking the maximum flexibility in the phasing out arrangements for the EU export refunds scheme. On market access, it is vitally important that Irish and EU farmers [607]have sufficient time to adjust to CAP reform and, in particular, the impact of the introduction of the decoupled payment system. An effective import regime has a vital role to play. Therefore, my aim is to retain a realistic and effective level of protection for our producers and exporters. As to non-trade concerns, with others, I have repeatedly drawn attention to the importance of this issue and, in particular, the fair application of equivalence in sanitary and phyto-sanitary protection. I will continue to raise this issue in the context of the WTO negotiations and elsewhere. It is regrettable that other negotiating partners are focusing on pursuing further concessions from the European Union without sufficient reciprocal movement on their part. The European Union cannot be blamed for the current difficulties in the negotiations because we have made significant contributions to the round. Other developed countries and the more economically advanced developing countries must step up and deliver if an ambitious Doha Round which will benefit the poorest countries is to be achieved. I will continue to have an active role in the ongoing negotiations and will vigorously pursue the key objectives I have outlined. I will also continue to work closely with the Commission and other like-minded member states to secure a balanced agreement which will benefit Ireland.",Ahern
"I appreciate the help of Deputy Hayes. It is even longer than I thought it is nearly 30 years ago. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, was referring to that referendum in the context of Seanad reform which can be introduced. Other reforms came from the report of the committee on Seanad reform, which Deputy Brian Hayes will recall, which we can deal with. That is also what the Minister was referring to which I support. There was an urgency in the Upper House that we undertake some of these reforms. If we get into deeper reform and total change of the Seanad, as suggested in this House and elsewhere, it will mean a different constitutional referendum. That is not what the Minister or I stated. There may be merits in it but it would have to be examined in a separate context. Regarding the Deputy’s points about Northern Ireland and the Seanad, I have stated as Taoiseach that there are issues we would be prepared to examine in reforming the Seanad. Some of these could be introduced without a constitutional amendment while some may need one. I am still honour bound to deal with those ones that do not require a referendum and which can be done in the short term.",Hayes
I thank the Minister of State. The next speakers are Deputy Chris Andrews and Deputy Cyprian Brady who wish to share 20 minutes. Is that agreed? Agreed. I call Deputy Andrews first. He has ten minutes.,Andrews
"Like Deputy Johnny Brady, I am glad to speak on this issue. In the last review of constituencies when I became a candidate, Deputy Brady had to hand over several lovely areas such as Moynalty, Carlanstown, Nobber, Gibbstown, Kilmainhamwood, Oristown and Meath Hill. There is genuine fear in those communities with regard to EirGrid’s proposals. While this is a technical, enabling Bill, I am glad the Minister recognised the public concerns in his speech. He referred to the complexity of the task facing EirGrid. Would it be possible to make even slight amendments to the Bill in terms of what EirGrid may be required to do when it proposes projects above and beyond what is contained in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act? When EirGrid comes to the town, there is never a show like it. Chaos reigns and people fear, as we have seen time and again. An extra level of consultation should be required specifically for EirGrid. There is nothing else like it. I have been to meetings attended by almost the entire population of parishes, which I am sure has also been the experience in other counties. There are massive concerns, including with regard to health. One can read all the WHO studies one likes, but when one visits communities where there are already pockets of cancer, it is impossible to argue there is no health risk, particularly as many studies recognise this risk, as pointed out by Deputy Brady. The people of County Meath are very concerned about the visual impact given our tourism potential and the innate beauty of the county and the wildlife. I am conscious that Gibbstown is a Gaeltacht area. It is a great community but there is much fear about the impact on the culture and heritage of the area. Planning permission is one of the biggest issues for families in rural Ireland at present, particularly for those working in agriculture. There will be many restrictions in the north east [54]if this project goes ahead. The right of people to live on their own land and contribute to their communities will be put in serious jeopardy. The Minister gladly took on board the huge public concern. He made a wise decision to commission a study because there are arguments for and against the proposal. While EirGrid put up a very strong argument that the cost of its plans is low, what price our health, environment and heritage? I have met people who claim the lines could be put underground for a fraction of the cost and in a simple way. What the Minister has done with the independent study is very welcome, as is its short time frame. We look forward to the findings and hope the study will provide what we consider to be the right answer, which is to put the lines underground. To do that would have major implications throughout the country. There are already many 400 kV lines. If, as we hope, the lines go underground in counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, then lines elsewhere would also have to be considered, and future projects would have to be undertaken along the lines of the findings of this report. The Government is often accused of not planning developments but it cannot be accused of not planning for future energy needs. Interconnectors are part of this process and the people of Meath accept this. They are always happy to see progress, for example, with regard to the M3. The M3 is a balance between the needs of our people and protecting our heritage but EirGrid’s proposals for County Meath are significantly unbalanced and balanced against the ordinary man and women in the lane and road — we do not have many streets in north Meath. The Government is focused on planning, as it must be because energy is a key requirement and the country must be kept alight. We can see the result of the Israeli blockade in the Holy Land, where the UN is running out of fuel and may have to stop operations. That is a particular case concerning energy supply. We must look after this country for the decades and generations to come. The people will support the Government in this regard and will welcome anything which helps them to plan their daily lives and businesses better. However, they demand that the lines be put underground. I will give them every support I can.",Brady
"I listened with interest as the Minister spoke of the RAPID programme and, as a councillor of many years standing in the south-west inner city, I have much to say on the regeneration of communities and the consultation process. I too was at the awards ceremony the Minister attended and it was clear to me that such awards are important to young people at the early stages of their lives as they give a new insight into who they are and they help them feel they are achieving something. Many of the children who received these awards at the ceremony will go on to do greater things as they get older. The contribution of the South West Inner City Network, SWICN, has had a huge impact on young people in schools in the inner city and the Liberties and I welcomed the Minister’s words at the ceremony. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, for his reference to the words I spoke last week, which I will not go back over. Some weeks ago Deputy Enda Kenny called me into his office to ask me to speak on the national drugs strategy on behalf of Fine Gael and I was taken aback because I am not an expert in the area. I cannot pronounce the names of many of the drugs available but I can speak at length on the real problems drugs have introduced to communities. I lived in a close-knit area of Inchicore but in the 1980s one could not enter one’s front garden without seeing a person shooting up there. Many elderly people had to change their post office books to receive their allowances from another area because they were afraid to walk the streets of Inchicore. Drugs had a devastating effect on the community, businesses and residents there and brought Inchicore to its knees. I grew up in the area and, as the Minister knows, was involved in community work so I saw [1595]young people at the youth club who clearly would not reach their teenage years due to drugs. I visited such young people in hospitals through the years, I sat beside many as they died, I sang at their funerals and attended many services, as have other Deputies, to commemorate the loss of young lives. I will never forget, at such services, seeing the faces of family members etched with distraught and anguish at the loss they suffered. I have known the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, for some time and I am aware of his commitment to communities and particularly this issue. I know the Government is making progress but I think we have some way to go. That is why I welcome this review. It is important that, every so often, we dust down these glossy documents and go through them again. It is only then that we can review what has been done. As the song says, a picture paints a thousand words. In the Irish Examiner last week, we were shown graphic images of what drugs can do to a person’s body, mind and soul, and the damage they cause to communities. The media are sometimes deserving of blame in the manner in which they highlight such issues. However, this particular report illustrated the devastating effect of drugs on society. The media has a major role to play in how all of us, particularly young people, view drugs. Drugs are often glamorised on television and in magazines and the dangers are not highlighted. By contrast, the Irish Examiner should be commended on the approach it took. Young people are targeted by the media, which often show the glamorous version of what drug abuse entails. As a parent of young children, I am aware that many popular music idols, soap opera actors and film stars are openly abusing drugs. We cannot protect our children from this type of exposure but we can educate them about the damage drugs can do to their bodies and general well-being and to their families. An anti-litter advertisement is currently being shown on television in which a young woman walks down the road dropping litter. While she continues to believe she looks beautiful, her image gradually changes in other people’s eyes. We must take the same approach in regard to drugs awareness through the media. The anti-litter advertisement and the one warning of the dangers of drink-driving, in which a young girl is seen in a wheelchair in a graveyard, have had a profound effect on many young people, including my own children. The reform of the drugs strategy should include a consideration of how the media can be utilised to further its objectives. There is a large and ever increasing cocaine abuse problem in Dublin and throughout the State. Although we have known about this for ten or 12 years, an effective rehabilitation programme is still not in place to assist people to overcome their addiction to this drug. Some small pilot projects are in operation but those working [1596]in local task forces insist that this is inadequate. We are talking about people, including young children, with a serious addiction. Teenagers as young as 14 or 15 years are taking cocaine. We must ensure the facilities are in place to offer rehabilitation to young people as soon as they request it. The lack of psychological services for those abusing drugs is another aspect of the problem. Many addicts who attend services provided by local drugs task forces are doing their best to overcome their addiction. However, one can only access some of these services if one has already stopped taking drugs. A person who approaches a local drugs task force and asks to be included in a rehabilitation programme will only be admitted if he or she is clean of drugs. I do not understand this approach. Many of the responsibilities taken on by staff of local drugs task forces go beyond their official capacity. I know of staff who have waited for hours in accident and emergency departments, sometimes at night, with people who have presented in a terrible condition. These people are trying their best to recover and are in a vulnerable position. The only way in which staff can seek psychological support for them is to take them to an accident and emergency department. Urgent action must be taken to address this shortcoming in psychological support services. Addicted persons who are fortunate enough to have the money can check themselves into a private clinic where they have a good chance of resolving their addiction. However, that help is not available to those without the resources to obtain it privately. One must be clean of drugs before being admitted to publicly funded addiction support services. I understand that more than €200 million was spent last year under the national drugs strategy. Given that level of expenditure, it is sad to discover that a significant proportion of drug users undergoing rehabilitation are still in school. This is shocking. The social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme in schools must be expanded. I put a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education and Science this week asking when the SPHE programme will be rolled out for senior cycle in all schools. The Minister states in her reply: A programme in social, personal and health reduction for senior cycle is currently being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, but no proposals in this area have as yet been submitted to by Department. The council has consulted widely on a draft curriculum framework, and there has been general acceptance that it should cover such areas as mental health, gender studies, substance use, relationships and sexuality education, and physical activity and nutrition. The SPHE programme should be extended immediately, because we cannot afford to wait [1597]any longer. Many young people begin by dabbling in drugs at parties and a great many are pressurised by their peers to experiment. If I were granted one wish in regard to the fight against drug abuse, it would be that we begin again. We must recognise the importance of education and ensure that children are informed of the dangers as soon as they begin primary school. There must be a thorough review of how such issues as substance abuse, health and well-being are communicated to pupils from the beginning of their primary schooling right through to senior level and on to third level. I welcome the review of the national drugs strategy and I look forward to addressing some questions to the Minister at the conclusion of this discussion.",Carey
"I am proud to speak on this motion put forward by the Minister for Defence and, in so doing, to pick up on some of the points that have been made in the House during the debate. I come from an Army town, with the headquarters of the Western Command across the River Shannon. The proposed mission is a Western Brigade mission. It is important that we mark this fact. Troops from Athlone, Galway, Longford, Mullingar and Donegal will be going, along with some troops from other areas. It is essentially a Western Brigade mission. In my town and county we are very proud of the men and women who have gone abroad on other missions. Although Deputy Creighton has left, I must point out that there is no such thing as a safe mission. The idea that one mission is safer than another is ridiculous. If one goes abroad to fight or, as we are doing, to keep the peace, one does not believe one is going on a sunshine holiday. I was reminded sharply of what happened in the Congo during a graveyard commemoration last summer for some of the people who had been lost there. We can only think back to that it was surely the most perilous mission of all. However, [1238]every command is perilous and nobody who goes on a mission thinks it is easier than Cyprus, the Lebanon or Liberia. The Army is not imbued with those kinds of spirits or feelings. They are imbued with spirit for going where they are sent as part of their mission statement when they enlisted in the Army. The troops and officers on this mission know that they are going on a perilous journey. The journey will be simple enough, but the operations of the troops will be fraught with danger. How could it not be so, working in an area of that size? I was amazed that the area is the size of France, Spain and Germany combined. They are going to Chad under the triple-lock mechanism, an enormous safeguard for us under which the Europe Union, the United Nations and our Parliament give permission. That is as it should be. They are our troops who are fighting for our country and enlisted in our Army. Of course it is a humanitarian mission. I was taken by the enormous perils which the people who have come into the camps are undergoing and I do not know how they are able to manage their daily lives. I commend the fact that the Minister for Defence, Deputy O’Dea, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, went separately to see what the terrain and the circumstances would be like and to know what we were taking on and going into. Likewise, I commend the group of women headed by former President Mary Robinson who went there and reported on what the women told them. The women have gone from one difficult situation to another extremely difficult one in camp there and the Army will be fully stretched in dealing with the aspect of their mission on this occasion. We all have approved of Lieutenant General Pat T. Nash and I wish him well as he sallies forth with his troops to do his duty. For a country the size of Ireland with our troop capacity, which is not enormous, it is amazing — the Minister and I had a brief conversation about this previously — that we are able to go with such vigour and enthusiasm to such dangerous spots around the world to take charge of a mission to keep the peace, which is what it is all about, and to care for the dispossessed. There is sure and firm evidence of many other missions which established great friendships. There are people still visiting Athlone as a result of friendships made in Cyprus, in the main, by our soldiers who went there on difficult missions. I am sure the friendships will endure. I note that the advance force departs in December, but it will be January when the main mission departs. Lest we think that they will have a less perilous time than the time before, it is not at all like that. I deal in the main with many women and while I understand from the Minister that there will be women Army personnel taking part in this mission, in many instances it is the [1239]mothers, wives, sweethearts, sisters and daughters of the male personnel involved who will bear the burden of worry, who will scan the news for every word from eastern Chad and read the newspapers for everything they can glean from them about Chad, and who never thought that they would find themselves in these circumstances. Due to the work of Army personnel, we now are acquainted with places with which we never would have become acquainted previously. Liberia and Chad are two of those exotic sounding places news of which we would not have bothered listening to, except that we now know that our troops are going there or have been there, and have acquitted themselves in such a fine fashion. I am not speaking in terms of fairy tales and Pollyanna. I know what I am talking about as I was born, brought up and reared in the town of Athlone with many of the sons and daughters of those who have been abroad. The town is proud of our forces. We are proud of the Western Brigade. We are very proud that Athlone is the headquarters of what was the Western Command, now the Western Brigade. People ask why Athlone was picked to be the Western Brigade headquarters. That is the way history laid it out. Custume Barracks is across the River Shannon. The Minister, Deputy O’Dea, is an honoured guest whenever he comes to our town and we hope that prior to this deployment he will pay us a further visit, perhaps to say farewell to them. I am very much in favour of the motion. I am conscious of the dangers our troops will face. At the same time, I am proud of what Irish troops from a peace-living and peacekeeping country have done over the years in wishing to ensure that they can spread their peace and humanitarian message into the strife-torn country of eastern Chad. I pay tribute to those who lost their lives over the years or were injured in various other missions in which the Irish forces were deployed.",Kitt
"I am glad to have this opportunity to speak. I will highlight one comment made by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, prior to the budget which was that he was committed to ensuring that no sector would avoid a cut. In fairness, he has achieved this not one sector has been left out of the budget. The question of leadership, or a lack thereof, is raised. We have a petrified paralysed Government more afraid to make decisions than to think about positive action and proactivity. This is at a time when there is anger, disillusionment and apathy in the country. I believe apathy is far more dangerous than anger and it has entered this stage, which the Minister of State knows from travelling the length and breadth of the country. We have a crisis. The budget was an attempt by the Government to get the country back on track towards recovery. This certainly will not be the case. We have had two years of nervous anticipation and expectation of cuts and more cuts. As John Maynard Keynes pointed out, it is the expectation of cuts rather than cuts themselves that can be more dangerous to an economy. I spoke to a small shopkeeper in Letterkenny who was able to point out to me that his sales in the three weeks prior to the budget were down 20%. It is this type of nervousness in the economy, the issue of leadership and the paralysis surrounding and associated with the Government that has left the country in a perilous state. While accepting that we have to make hard decisions, we must also accept that we have to make changes including to the type of governance employed in the country. I do not think the budget has done so in any way. It is very big on theory but the specifics have been left out. Cuts of more than €742 million will be made in health but we have not been given specific information on them. Last year, €90 million was allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF this has been reduced by €5 million to €85 million. While €5 million is a lot of money, we are still spending €85 million on getting rid of gridlock and queues in our health services and on accommodating people who cannot otherwise avail of hospital services. I have just received a note with clarification on the slot. I believe it will run until 8 p. m.",Lenihan
"I wish to share time with Deputies Dinny McGinley, Terence Flanagan and Denis Naughten. It is a pity that the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, has left the Chamber because I hoped he would come in here and give us a ten-minute talk on how he would help businesses. We all know that Enterprise Ireland and the enterprise boards do plenty of work, but they need more help. They need the rules to be changed and they need more cash to distribute to the people who need it. They cannot give enough to help businesses. While there are some incentives in place, they are not enough. That is what I wanted to hear from the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness. I wanted him to outline the wonderful things he is planning to do, not what was done in the past. We know all about the past and how wonderful it was. It was suggested earlier that Deputy Richard Bruton and other members of my party should listen to the Government in terms of how it conducts its business. The Government has decided to refocus after ten years in office. In yesterday’s announcement, the Government told us about the new arrangements, as follows: The measures agreed by Government are clearly focused on: savings in administrative spending, economising on the services we buy, driving efficiency, reducing the proliferation of agencies, squeezing consultancy and PR spending, streamlining the delivery of services, re-prioritising certain capital spending going forward. This is the new focus of a Government that has been in power for over ten years. The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, claims that the Government acts like a business, but the seven points listed are actions that all businesses engage in all the time, not just as of yesterday. That is how one runs a country, with all those priorities in place. One does not just start to do it in the middle of a recession. That is the way businesses are run. Deputy McGuinness has been a Minister of State for the past few months but it is a pity he does not have any influence in the Government because this is the way business should have been done before now. [689]Yesterday we were told that the Government had a big plan that would restore confidence in the country but it will do no such thing. The plan contained no concrete announcements and did not bring clarity to the potential cutbacks. It left everything in limbo. It referred to a 3% payroll reduction, as if it could be achieved just like that. It is not as simple as that. Such a reduction will result in reduced services and will affect the work of county councils and other bodies. It will result in cutbacks in services. Yesterday, the Minister for Finance did not have the guts to announce the cuts and passed the job of relaying the bad news down the line. Details will come out every month for the next 18 months, through announcements by county councils, enterprise board, FÁS and various other bodies. We will have announcements by everybody except the Minister in this House, who will not take responsibility for cutbacks. The announcement yesterday has not restored confidence but has simply fudged the issues. People are still not sure what will happen. They will continue to wait and wonder what the Government will do in September or December in the budget. It has not restored confidence or given anybody reassurance. It has stalled the process again and we know what happened when the Government stalled on stamp duty — it created serious problems. I wish to take issue with a comment made by the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher. He claimed, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, that the Government has been wonderful in reducing the national debt. However, while it may have reduced the public debt, it most certainly did not reduce the private debt. Public debt has gone down but private debt has risen enormously. We are probably the most privately-indebted country in Europe, if not the world. The people of this country are carrying the Government and have been for a long time. They are paying for houses, 42% of the price of which went into the Government’s coffers in tax. The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, spoke about previous Governments causing his generation major problems because of the spiralling national debt. I wish to remind him that the Government has caused my generation major problems by saddling us with 30 or 40 years of a burden in terms of mortgages for houses that are not worth even half what we have paid for them, given that almost half of the price was tax. I ask the Deputy not to try to tell me that the Government has done the country a favour. Part of the plan announced yesterday was supposed to be related to cost-savings. Part of our job as politicians is to point out where savings can be made, but yesterday’s plan did not do that. There are a number of areas from which savings could be gleaned. In the past few months I managed to obtain a number of replies from the Government to parliamentary questions. I found out that consultancy costs in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 2007 were €10. 5 million, the Department of Transport, €3. 3 million and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, €10 million. The plan refers to cutting back on such costs but does not give any figures. To what level will such spending be cut back? We were also told that the Government will cut staff but if it does that, it may have to hire more consultants. Was this plan really thought out properly? I do not think so. The Government has been talking for a long time about e-procurement. It produced a report in 2000 telling us that it was going to introduce e-procurement which would save us €177 million per year. Seven times that figure for the past seven years is well over €1 billion. Why was this not done? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform boasted about all the shared services we are going to have. We did not have them. It was recommended years ago that we should share services yet this Government spent €60 million or €70 million on putting a new financial services system in all 15 Departments when two or three shared would have done it. I have a long list of things we could do but I will not go into them tonight. There are plenty of things we could do to help this country but we do not see any plans here to save or protect [690]jobs or to give confidence. Hopefully, the Ministers might listen to my ideas in September when I return. We must have a proper plan, not a load of crap like that which we received yesterday because this is what it was.",Flanagan
"I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline the current position in respect of the proposed building project at Coláiste Pobail Naomh Mhuire in Buttevant, County Cork. All applications for capital funding are assessed in the school planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science. The assessment process determines the extent and type of accommodation needed at each school, based on such matters as the demographics of the local area, any proposed housing developments in the locality, the condition of the school buildings, and the capacity of the proposed site. That process ultimately leads to the determination of an appropriate accommodation solution. As part of this process, each proposed project is assigned a band rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners. Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need. This is reflected in the band rating that is assigned to them. There are four band ratings, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest. Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists, but there is a high demand for pupil places. Band 4 projects are those in which facilities are desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential. Each band rating has a number of sub-categories which more specifically describe the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them. Coláiste Pobail Naomh Mhuire in Buttevant is the sole post-primary education provider in Buttevant. It operates under the aegis of County Cork VEC and has a current enrolment of 192 pupils. Enrolments at the school are stable. The VEC applied to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding to provide a new school building for Coláiste Pobail Naomh Mhuire on a greenfield site. The proposed new school building was to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 325 pupils. The project reached an early stage of architectural planning in 2001. At that time, the VEC identified a site for the new school. However, acquisition of the site was not finalised for a number of reasons. In the intervening period, the Department became concerned about declining enrolments in the school. In that light, its planning and building unit conducted a review of second level education provision in the Buttevant area. This review took into account factors such as enrolment trends at the school, the impact [954]of projected housing developments and existing post-primary school provision in the general area. On completion of this review, the Department affirmed its original decision that a new school on a greenfield site should be provided to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 325 pupils. Approval was given to County Cork VEC to identify a suitable site to enable the provision of this building. A site has been acquired for that purpose. Consistent with the approach that the Minister, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, has outlined, the application was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2 rating. Due to the level of demand on my Department’s capital budget, unfortunately, the Minister is not in a position to provide an indicative timeframe as to when this project can proceed further. Deputy Sherlock will appreciate that modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task in light of the decades of under-investment in this area and the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. The Minister, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe wants to assure the Deputy that the Government has a sincere determination to ensure that all children are educated in appropriate facilities to enable the delivery of a broad and balanced curriculum. This is evidenced by the scale of funding made available for school buildings under the former and current national development plans. Thousands of school building projects were carried out under the last national development plan to provide new and modernised educational infrastructure. Thousands more will be carried out under the new national development plan. Projects will be advanced incrementally through the system over time on a prioritised basis, as and when the funding situation allows. I thank the Deputy again for raising this matter. The Department’s planning and building unit is well aware of the needs of Coláiste Pobail Naomh Mhuire. It will be in contact with the VEC when it is in a position to advance the project further.",O'Keeffe
"I will share time with Deputy Beverley Flynn. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me an opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of the Health Bill 2008. The issue of medical cards for elderly people has been most emotive, with many people fearing that all medical cards would be taken from those aged over 70 years. Such a step was never intended. Hearing people from my parents’ generation cry, worried and fearful, on radio shows made for tough listening. The real fear of many people was on display at the protest on Kildare Street following the budget. However, I am reminded of how quickly times change given that in 2001 Opposition Deputies had no appetite for the introduction of medical cards for those aged 70 years and over. Under the new system, the Health Service Executive will write to all medical card holders aged 70 years and over informing them about the new arrangements. People whose income is below the new threshold will keep their cards and continue to use them as normal. Only those whose incomes are above the threshold will be required to notify the HSE. If a person’s income is below the limits, he or she will not have to wait on a letter to arrive and should not be worried or fearful. Such persons can rest assured they will keep the medical card. This vital information, which was lost in the debate, needs to be reiterated. The new income thresholds are designed to ensure that the vast majority of people aged 70 years and over will continue to have a medical card and only those on higher incomes will lose their entitlement. The new income thresholds announced by the Government for persons aged 70 years and over mean that from 1 January 2009 onwards, retired Ministers, Ministers of State, judges and Secretaries General of Government Departments, to name but a few, will no longer qualify for a medical card. Should such individuals receive a medical card? Individuals in these groups earned enough money in their working lives. Medical cards would be better placed in the hands of ordinary men and women who earned a modest wage during their career or do not have a substantial pension. Deputy Jan O’Sullivan asked the reason gross income is used as the threshold. Income is any earning a person receives in the form of a pension or through investments or savings. Under the scheme, gross income is assessed, that is, income before tax or other deductions. It is much easier to identify what is one’s gross income. The new gross income thresholds are well in excess of the net limits of €360 and €720 for a single person and couple, respectively. [362] Previously, those whose income was less than these thresholds would only have qualified for a GP visit card. It should also be noted that only the interest earned on savings is counted as income, while income from savings up to the first €36,000 for a single person and €72,000 for a couple is not counted. However, those whose income is over the threshold may still receive a medical card if their personal or health circumstances cause them undue financial hardship. In the event that one partner is aged 70 years, both partners will qualify for a medical card if their income is less than €1,400 per week. In addition, the current HSE appeals mechanism will continue to apply. There will always be pressing demands on scarce national resources. It would be a wonderful world if everyone received free medical care but unfortunately we do not live in such a utopia.",O'Sullivan
"I apologise to Deputy Costello for the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, this evening. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The Minister shares his view, and that of communities throughout the country, that anti-social behaviour at Hallowe’en must be prevented to the greatest extent possible and kept under control. The Garda authorities take proactive steps each year to combat anti-social and criminal behaviour around Hallowe’en by putting specific provisions in place and will do so again this year. Particular attention will be paid, especially in the Dublin metropolitan region and Border divisions, to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks in the lead up to Hallowe’en. Since the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, it is an offence for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence to throw an ignited firework at any person or property and to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place. The penalties for those offences have also been significantly increased. Proactive policing arrangements will be in place to cover the period up to, and the night of, Hallowe’en. Additional patrols will be carried out, as considered necessary by Garda management, by uniformed personnel as part of high-visibility policing initiatives, supported by district detective and drug units, divisional crime task forces, traffic corps personnel and community policing and mountain bike units. The Garda Síochána also engages with local communities, local authorities and other stakeholders, such as Dublin Bus, in putting plans in place to address issues that arise around the Hallowe’en period. It puts liaison arrangements in place for the removal of identified stockpiles of combustible materials. Through the schools programme and other local programmes, members of the Garda Síochána publicise the message that fireworks are illegal and highlight the dangers associated with illegally imported fireworks. Gardaí also advise managers of off-licences to ensure that their staff are made aware of their obligations under licensing legislation relating to the sale of alcohol, in particular to under-age persons. Members of the Garda Síochána from local community policing units ensure that any information received regarding bonfires and other anti-social behaviour is acted upon in advance of Hallowe’en. During this period additional public order patrols will, as necessary, be directed to pay particular attention to areas where anti-social behaviour and drinking in public might occur. More generally, all members of the Garda Síochána proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour. Areas identified as public order hot spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols. Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and are dealt with appropriately in accordance with the law. More than 643,000 offences have been detected since the commencement of Operation Encounter by the then Commissioner in February 2002 to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour against the local and business communities, with particular emphasis on alcohol-related behaviour. Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in that regard. Furthermore, the Intoxicating [342]Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order. In addition, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Garda to tackle misuse of alcohol, which is too often at the root of crime and anti-social behaviour. Gardaí now have the power to seize alcohol in the possession of under-18 year olds which they suspect is for consumption in a public place. They can also seize alcohol where they reasonably believe there is a danger of public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place. They also now have the power to issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place. These notices will lead to a more efficient and effective use of Garda resources and avoid court proceedings where an offender pays the penalty. The Criminal Justice Act 2006 strengthened the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to make it an offence to assault, or to threaten to assault, or to impede medical personnel in a hospital, people assisting such personnel, a member of the Garda Síochána, a prison officer and a member of the Defence Forces, members of the fire brigade and ambulance personnel. I am confident that the Garda Commissioner will deploy the considerable resources of personnel and equipment available to him to combat the anti-social behaviour which unfortunately is apt to take place during the Hallowe’en period.",Ahern
"The Government Alcohol Advisory Group (GAAG) was established by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

"This is a diabolical way to treat a new young Deputy. Deputy Collins is probably a man of integrity and a sincere young politician, but he is caught up in a system. Someone within the Minister’s party made him stand up and do the Minister’s dirty work today. Everything he read out, possibly for the first time, made scurrilous accusations and was an absolute disgrace. One of the two men, at least, was present to defend himself but the other was not. Former Deputy Jim Higgins was not present either to defend himself when the Minister was speaking. The Minister talked about the bigger picture. He has no idea about the bigger picture in County Donegal and no idea what he is talking about. He has no idea who is on the winning side and who is on the losing side. There have been absolutely no winners, past or present, with regard to the Morris tribunal. There have been only losers in terms of everybody being hurt and conspiracy theories for decades. In years to come we will talk about this event and the events in County Donegal. People will talk about innuendo, allegations and counter allegations. The hallmark of the Morris tribunal is that it completely pinpoints one part of this country in respect of one, two, three or a dozen particular episodes. This has been a period of hurt for many people, for the families involved such as the McBrearty family, the McConnells and their extended family, Richie Barron’s family and also the gardaí who ended up being caught up either directly or indirectly and their families, including their sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, wives and husbands. This goes to the core of the human level. There is a lot of hurt and I say to the Minister that this is the big picture. It took the Minister until page seven of a 14-page transcript to come up with a bigger picture. That is an absolute disgrace and I will return to that aspect. The only winners with regard to the entire escapade will be in the future and I welcome that. I also welcome that there are recommendations and there have been some positive outcomes in respect of the Morris tribunal. The Garda Síochána Act and the Garda Ombudsman are a result of the outcome of this investigation. It might appear that €50 million is a lot of money and taxpayers will always question who benefited from that type of investment. What we have had in this country, however, was the tipping point of a Garda mechanism that was not working for our society. It happened to occur in County Donegal but it could have happened in any part of the country. It is not a matter of County Donegal in isolation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is spending 50% of his time here today but he has no interest in this feedback. He wants to talk now about other issues with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan. That is how the people perceive him and the Fianna Fáil Party, in any case, but he has no idea of this as he listens. He has no idea what is going on outside the House or how people feel. He does not know how to listen. The Minister may continue talking but he has come into the Chamber and spent seven out of 14 pages attacking two men who came forward with information. Did they have 20-20 vision? Had Deputies Higgins and Howlin 20-20 vision concerning what to do? I was not a politician in this House when they were given that information. Every member of Fianna Fáil has 20-20 vision when the thing is done. [773]It is an absolute scandal that the Minister has attacked two politicians of integrity. The former Deputy Jim Higgins suffered. He lost his seat arising from the whole situation, possibly for making this move. Perhaps he did the right thing, perhaps it was the wrong thing, but he and Deputy Howlin introduced a mechanism to stop the pain when there were no such mechanisms in place. The Minister has even admitted that he is to set up a new mechanism under the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in respect of how this should be dealt with in future. The Minister admits there was no mechanism in place",Lenihan

"The Taoiseach has been a Member of the House long enough to know that this has become a farce. There was one occasion on which a senior Minister was in a licensed premises near the Dáil when the case of a man who had been murdered was discussed in the House. The Minister in question should have been present for that debate. The Taoiseach may recall that famous incident which was raised by Deputy Allen at the time. The Taoiseach and I know that serious reforms are required in order to make the House more responsible and accountable and its workings more transparent. One area in respect of [4]which reform is required is that to which Deputy Gilmore refers, namely, the Adjournment debate. The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has responsibility for this matter but we have not yet seen the colour of his eyes in respect of it. There are a dozen reports in his office — from Government and Opposition parties — in respect of some of which there is a large measure of agreement on how we could make the Dáil more interesting and relevant. It is his responsibility to ensure action is taken on the recommendations made in them. I hope he will take on board the urgings of the Taoiseach and ensure such action is taken. Under the current system, if Deputy D’Arcy wishes to raise a matter on the Adjournment tomorrow and the Ceann Comhairle allows him to do so, someone in the relevant Department will prepare a script which might not necessarily deal with the issues in respect of which the Deputy is seeking information. There is a solution in this regard, which is contained in one of the reports sitting in the Minister of State’s office. The Labour Party and Fine Gael are in agreement on that solution and I am sure a large number of Fianna Fáil Members would concur with it. Under the proposal to which I refer, a second or third question could be put by the Deputy raising the original matter. When are we likely to obtain a comprehensive package from the Minister of State who has responsibility for this matter? He could make a name for himself by reforming the Dáil and making it exciting and interesting in order that Members would want to come into the Chamber to raise matters and receive replies in respect of them. The Government should treat this as a matter of priority. I accept that it has various economic issues with which it must deal and challenges it will be obliged to face. However, the House has in many ways become irrelevant to the Government which chooses to make all major announcements relating to legislation and other matters outside it. In many instances and from a Government point of view, the Dáil is treated as a place where one should not be. The Taoiseach has been involved in politics for some time and is aware of this. Will information on this matter be forthcoming before the end of next week or will we be obliged to wait until October for the Minister of State to outline his proposals? I accept that, in the context of Dáil reform, the said proposals may receive a large measure of support from Members. What is the remit of the Office of the Minister for Children? I am concerned about the comments made by the DPP last weekend in regard to his inability to take prosecutions in the absence of a referendum on children. It seems that the changes of personnel on the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children in respect of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, have brought about a serious change of attitude, and not for the good, towards the progress it was making previously. More than two years ago, my party pointed out that a hole existed in the Constitution and that a referendum was required to plug it, but the matter appears to have stalled. Has the Taoiseach instructed the Minister of State with responsibility for children that his primary responsibility is to ensure this House deals with the issue of a referendum for children so that young boys and girls do not become the victims of sexual predators? When somebody of the eminence of the Director of Public Prosecutions is unable to proceed because of a requirement for a referendum, surely it should be the responsibility of this House to progress the matter. From my party’s point of view, we submitted our proposals by the date requested but matters seem to have stalled and I ask the Taoiseach to have a word with the new Minister of State with responsibility for children. Can he confirm that it remains his intention to hold a referendum on children’s rights, either on strict liability or the broader issue, and, if so, when will it take place?",Carey
"I wish to acknowledge the recent appointment of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I wish him [1029]every success in his new portfolio. I also pay tribute to his predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and thank him for his personal courtesy to me as Opposition spokesman. I recognise the previous Minister’s work in the Department, albeit over a short period. It is a long time since the new Minister and I were Government and Opposition Whips, respectively. Since then, the Minister has dealt with a number of important issues in various Departments. I wish him well in his new role. Fine Gael will offer him co-operation on matters which should be prioritised in the areas of justice, security, law reform and equality. It is a large Department and perhaps nobody knows better than the Opposition spokesman the wide range of briefs concerned, which can be both time consuming and taxing. As a fresh face in the Department, perhaps the Minister could consider, along with his Government colleagues, restoring or building on the civil and criminal justice arms of the Department. In the 1990s, the civil arm was separated into the equality and law reform portfolio, while the criminal arm deals with matters of domestic security. The Department has a wide brief with major responsibilities. I consider that the experiment in the 1990s worked reasonably well, albeit that a small Department was being serviced at the time under the direction of the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor. That concept might be revisited, especially in view of what other jurisdictions have done in separating the various sections of their departments of justice. I look forward to debating the issues of concern and the challenges that lie ahead in the Department, and I wish the Minister well. 3 o’clock Fine Gael supports this Bill. For some time we have been calling for appropriate changes and amendments to be made to defamation law. We acknowledge the important role of the media as the Fourth Estate in a democracy. It is important that a country has a vibrant and free media as free speech is an important fundamental pillar of democracy. What we must always try to do is strike a balance between the right of an individual to his or her good name and the right to report in a free and unfettered manner. It is a long time since 1961 so it is important to revisit the legislation and modernise the laws dealing with slander, libel and the various defences to them. A considerable body of case law has built up in this area and it is necessary to codify that law in one legislative measure, particularly with regard to the defences to an action. That legislation is now before the House. A number of recent cases, particularly cases involving a late former Member of this House and a widely read Sunday newspaper, showed up deficiencies in the current legislation. Often, all that is required is an apology and, in some cases, only a simple apology but that cannot be done under the current legislation because it is connected to an admission of liability. That will change under this Bill. Similarly, unlike in the case of other civil actions, no lodgement can be made in court against a defamation action without it including an admission of liability. That has given rise to an adversarial stand-off between parties, with no resolution taking place until a court hearing, which might not occur until a number of years after the initial publication. It is also important that the range of remedies would expand and develop beyond mere damages. I welcome the proposals regarding rectification, clarification, declaratory orders and the other remedies excluding monetary compensation. There is also a need for clarity in respect of the role of the court in giving directions on the level of awards. This area has been something of a lottery in that it has not been possible to measure the damages in any consistent way. That has given rise to confusion and uncertainty, so the giving of directions on the level of awards is welcome. Similarly, at present the applicant or plaintiff or aggrieved party does not have the opportunity to submit sworn affidavits to corroborate their complaint. That will change, which is welcome. Perhaps the reading of such affidavits could give rise to earlier settlements than might otherwise be the case, as it will be possible to see from the affidavits the points of concern that remain at issue. Furthermore, the plaintiff or applicant will be in a position to [1030]take the stand for cross-examination, which they cannot be compelled to do under current legislation. The issue of time is important. The Press Council and the Press Ombudsman have spoken of the need for a swift response. This is most important. Currently, defamation actions in the High Court, where most defamation cases are taken, take up to six years to be heard. That is unacceptable when time is of the essence. There is a direct and clear link between the publication of the offending item and the hurt, grievance and damage caused. To allow a time lapse of four to six years in resolving the issue is in nobody’s interest and certainly not in the interest of the applicant or aggrieved party. Currently, there is no provision in the law for a defence of reasonable publication, which is a weakness. I am delighted with the range of defences outlined in reasonably clear terms in section 14 of this Bill. I noted the Minister’s comments on the defence of reasonable publication and I look forward to dealing with that in detail on Committee Stage. The Bill seeks to address many of the current deficiencies in the law with varying degrees of success. There was a considerable amount of debate on the Bill in the Seanad before its reading on Second Stage today. The new complaints procedure is welcome. I assume that anybody can make a complaint and that it is not necessary to have an immediate, first party interest in the matter. I presume it is open to any member of the community at any time to make a complaint on a matter about which they feel aggrieved and that it is not necessary for that person to have an interest in or have been mentioned in the publication. Indeed, the Press Ombudsman said on his appointment that the remedy he envisages would be free, fair and quick. These elements are of great importance. I welcome the defences set out in Part 3. There was a long period of public debate before the introduction of this Bill. That was welcome even if the legislation was delayed in that time. The Law Reform Commission report was published in December 1991. It contained 59 detailed proposals for reform. A draft defamation Bill was commissioned by the National Newspapers of Ireland in 1994, while a Private Members’ Bill was introduced by the former Deputy, Michael McDowell, in the mid-1990s. In 1996, there were further recommendations for reform from the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. The Government approved the draft Bill in December 2001 and in the following year the then Minister, former Deputy Michael McDowell, established an advisory group on defamation. The 2002 programme for Government contained a commitment that the Government would, in the context of a statutory press council and improved privacy laws, move to implement reforms of the libel law designed to bring it into line with that of other states. The former Minister, former Deputy Michael McDowell, said in the Seanad that the Bill delivers on the commitment in that programme. However, that was six years ago. In 2003, on foot of the recommendations of the advisory group, the former Minister initiated public consultation, including a major conference in December 2003, and three years later, in 2006, the Irish press industry steering committee published its proposals for an independent press council, press ombudsman and a code of practice or standards, much of which is incorporated in this legislation. It has taken this Bill some time to reach the Dáil. It lapsed with the dissolution of the 29th Dáil and was reintroduced in the 30th Dáil on Committee Stage. That decision caused some disquiet and annoyance to newly elected Senators who were most anxious to make their contribution to the Bill on Second Stage because they, quite rightly, took the view this was important legislation. I hope that in the course of this debate, whether on Second Stage or Committee Stage, every Deputy will have an opportunity of airing his or her views and dealing with this matter in a comprehensive way. [1031]I am delighted the Bill has eventually made its way to the floor of the Dáil, and welcome the opportunity to make a contribution. The media has long called for legislation in this area to ensure clarity and provide alternatives to court proceedings by way of remedy. While the Government was engaged in the public consultation process, and the draft Bills were being processed into what is before us, the media industry proceeded to take action and established and agreed to fund the offices of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council. The willingness by the media to step into the breach created by a certain inaction on the part of Government is commendable and shows a commitment to fairness and fair play. This willingness to engage is a source of great importance. Dr. John Horgan, the recently appointed Press Ombudsman, served in this House for many years and is doing a commendable job in his current post. I wish him well, as I am sure every Member of the House does. Without wishing to comment on individual cases, it is important to note the recent decision by the Press Ombudsman’s office as regards a complaint made by a Member of this House which was upheld by the Press Council. That was widely welcomed not only by politicians, but also by media people and journalists. That is indicative of a good, positive start to that highly onerous and important position and office. Dr. Horgan has noted that the job of the Press Council and Press Ombudsman will remain as a work in progress for some time. That is helpful, because it reflects his experience as a journalist, and as someone who was frequently written about in his earlier career as a practising politician. It is interesting that the council has a lay majority. That is important, and the code of practice prepared by a press industry committee appears to be based on very sound principles. However, it refers to the print media only, and it is important there should be some parallel for the broadcasting sector. There are ten fundamental principles attached to the code of practice, all of which are soundly based: truth and accuracy, distinguishing fact and comment, fairness and honesty, respect for rights, privacy, protection of sources, fairness and accuracy in court reporting, prevention of incitement to hatred, protection of children and the willingness to publish the decision of the Press Ombudsman, if requested to so do. These principles are very good and I also welcome the element of flexibility adopted by the Press Council which allows the code of practice to be routinely reviewed, amended and added to if necessary. An appropriate committee of this House should have the opportunity from time to time of officially participating in that debate and playing its part in these reviews, if necessary. The code of practice forms the basis for decision making by the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council. I must acknowledge the huge amount of work that went into the formulation of the code, which appears to incorporate best practice not only from Great Britain, but also Australia, Germany and the United States inter alia. The principles are founded on best international practice. It is open to any member of the public to complain about any article in an Irish newspaper, magazine or periodical which he or she believes is in breach of the code. Perhaps there may be some outstanding work to be done in publicising the code’s existence. Many people are not yet familiar, I believe, with the Office of the Press Ombudsman, his identity or indeed the Press Council, and an information campaign should be undertaken to inform the public in this regard so that a higher level of activity may be generated and the public can be offered the element of redress that is of such absolute importance. As Dr. Horgan said, the object of the exercise is to provide remedies that are quick, free and fair. There may, however, be a stumbling block in so far as the current subscription to the Press Council’s code of practice is voluntary. When introducing this Bill in its previous incarnation, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, stated that non-members of the Press Council would be required to have an equivalent and published code of standards to benefit from the Bill’s provisions in respect of 'reasonable publication'. [1032]The Minister made reference to a number of publications that have not yet signed up, and I wonder whether he might provide information as regards what percentage of publications have chosen to date to remain outside the Press Council mandate. Have most joined up or are many still waiting to participate? Have alternative codes been established by non-members of the Press Council? It is important to have one code acceptable to all rather than a variety of different codes and guidelines. Again, as regards the Press Council, in 2003 the legal advisory group reporting to former Deputy McDowell recommended its creation. He chose to ignore the recommendation at the time and seemed less than certain as regards whether this decision was right. However, as the Bill provides, the Minister may change his or her mind in future, and put the Press Council on a statutory footing. I should like to hear the views of the new Minister as to whether that option will be exercised and the council placed on a statutory footing. I am confident, however, that it will carry out its role in a fair and expedient manner under the stewardship of its current chairman, the eminent Professor Thomas Mitchell, who brings great experience and expertise to that position. If one wanted a chairman who was truly independent, one must agree he was a great choice, and I wish him well. It is important that the council should be guaranteed its funding and the Government has a role in ensuring it is properly resourced. The question of the source of funding might be a different matter, but it is important that it is properly resourced. There is the question of the sanctions that are available to the council, an area we may return to at a later stage. As regards the current Bill and the matter of damages, I welcome these provisions. The media has long made a fair point that the absence of clarity in this regard is somewhat unfair. There are no guidelines, directions or consistency and a proper balance is struck in allowing the judge to give directions to a jury as regards damages. Indeed, the definition and clarity as regards what factors should be taken into account in this context are important. I note special dispensation is being given to the Circuit Court to allow for an increased level of damages from the current level of approximately €38,000 to €50,000. In the broader civil law area, the Minister should consider increasing the ceiling level of the Circuit Court jurisdiction to accord with what is intended in the Bill to allow for a claim not exceeding a sum of €50,000 having regard to inflationary matters related to the consumer price index, etc. In recent times people have taken defamation actions in the Circuit Court for no other reason than the speed with which matters can either be settled or brought to a head. There is a difficulty. It is reasonable comment that one cannot justifiably put a ceiling on one’s reputation. Much has been written about the insistence of some members of the Cabinet that a Privacy Bill be introduced in tandem with this Bill, when this matter was discussed in another arena in public. The new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is before us, is on record as saying that he was one of those who favoured the introduction of both Bills, while his immediate predecessor, now Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said he would rather ascertain how the Press Council carried out its work and affairs before deciding on whether to proceed with the Privacy Bill. The Minister has acknowledged the birth of the Privacy Bill which is currently parked in the Seanad — a term used by his predecessor. The Minister has said it is in the Seanad. When concluding Second Stage, I ask the Minister to outline whether he shares the views of his predecessor or is he still of the view, as were many of his Fianna Fáil ministerial colleagues, that the Privacy Bill is both necessary and desirable. It appeared clear that the hand of the former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, was forced by his majority Fianna Fáil colleagues. While I am not sure about the benefits or otherwise of the Privacy Bill, it is important that the matter of its limbo status be clarified before we reach the concluding Stages of this Bill. [1033]I accept that the Press Council of Ireland has only been in a position to take complaints since 1 January and just over four months is not sufficient time for a full and fair assessment. I am anxious to hear the views of the new Minister in this regard. While we are not debating the Privacy Bill, suffice it to say that the restrictive nature of the Bill in its current form would give rise to concern for my party. I share the views of the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that we should give the new measures a chance before considering whether there is a need to proceed with the privacy legislation. After all, we have the Press Council of Ireland and the Press Ombudsman. If we have faith in the Bill before us it is probably reasonable to give it a chance before proceeding with further legislation. I do not believe the matter can remain uncertain or in limbo for too long. A number of amendments were made in the Seanad. From reviewing the Seanad debate it is clear that much work on the Bill took place in that House and some important amendments were not only discussed but also agreed. One of the more interesting amendments accepted requires that the apology by the media should be given the same or similar prominence to the original offensive article. I believe that measure will be universally accepted as being fair and efficient towards addressing the complaints of people feeling aggrieved or defamed. It was totally unsatisfactory to have an offending article on page 1 and a referred apology some weeks later that might be hidden in the corner of the sports’ pages. That is of fundamental importance and I welcome the acceptance by the Minister of amendments in that regard. The Minister mentioned the abolition of the criminal, obscene and seditious libel. I note the provisions in the Bill to abolish these common law offences and to make defamation purely a civil matter, which has been broadly welcomed. Welcome was given for the prohibition of jailing journalists. The abolition of the criminal libel will probably ensure that this would be the case. The Minister said he would refer aspects of Part 5 to the Attorney General. I hope this matter can be clarified in advance of Committee Stage because there are issues of importance, including the constitutional issues mentioned by the Minister. I ask the Minister to keep the House informed of his intentions in that regard. We should have a considerable time between the completion of Second Stage and the introduction of Government amendments, particularly those relating to Part 5. I very much welcome the provisions in the Bill allowing a cause of action in defamation cases to survive the death of the parties involved. This is a most difficult and sensitive issue that has been a source of serious concern to families of people who have themselves suffered because matters were not sufficiently clarified, brought to a head or dealt with before the death of a party who had a grievance or complaint. There are aspects of this that we should refer to on Committee Stage, as I am sure we will. I welcome the Bill and I again welcome the Minister on his first day in the Department. The Bill is overdue. Notwithstanding the delay, there has been a high degree of public debate of the important issues involved. I look forward to further examination of the provisions of this legislation on Committee Stage.",Lenihan
"I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and Deputy Coveney, on agreeing to the motion, which is the correct way to approach this issue. There is no need for it to be adversarial because, essentially, it is about improving the quality of services we can provide to the people we represent. It has become clear that technology will be at the very heart of the provision of public services in the future as it has become increasingly important in recent years. In embracing technology, it is essential the systems and services we set up on-line are flexible and can adapt to the changing nature of technology and that we can change them to respond to new needs and demands which will emerge from time to time. As Deputy Cuffe said, many commercial organisations have done great work in providing services on-line. Websites such as Ryanair. com and eBay. com have become part of everyday life in Ireland and around the world. Banking and shopping on-line are part of people’s everyday experiences. It is important we make a distinction between the provision of information on-line and the provision of public services on-line. There are many fine examples of the provision of information on-line by public bodies. The Citizens Information Board website is an outstanding resource which is widely used by the citizens of the State and which provides a wide range of information. The Basis website for businesses is very beneficial to anyone in business or considering starting a business. In terms of the provision of services, as a chartered accountant, I know from talking to colleagues regularly that the Revenue on-line service has transformed the way they do their work. Revenue has enjoyed real benefits in terms of efficiency. It is probably the single most successful e-Government initiative which allows Revenue to administer the business of twice as many taxpayers with fewer staff. That should be noted. Motor taxation was mentioned. As a former member of Cork County Council, Deputy Coveney will remember seeing people queue outside County Hall in Cork to renew their motor taxation at the end of every month. Thankfully, that will never be the case again. One can view real time air quality monitoring in one’s area on the Environmental Protection Agency website. The Companies Registration Office also has an excellent website and many services are available on-line on the national car test website. The way the Oireachtas does its business has changed for the better and it has really embraced technology in recent times. For example, replies to our parliamentary questions are on-line. However, we can all do more. Many Deputies, including myself, do not have websites and we need to change that, if we can. Departments have taken very important steps to provide services on-line but I would like to see us do more. For example, I would like the Department of Social and Family Affairs to accept applications on-line. I agree with Deputy Cuffe in regard to local authorities. There is much room for improvement there in terms of accepting housing applications, applications to register to vote and planning applications on-line and posting information on road programmes, road works, etc., on-line. Many local authorities do not provide a staff directory and one cannot find the person to contact on-line to deal with a particular issue. Data protection and identity theft are serious issues which will increasingly come to the fore as we embrace e-Government in the way we do our business. I agree with Deputy Ferris’s point that we must ensure equality of access to services, that people who do not have access to computers, broadband and the Internet are not discriminated against and that we continue to provide the traditional services on a one-to-one basis which many people enjoy. Again, I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and Deputy Coveney on agreeing to the motion. I look forward to the revised e-Government action plan due to be published in July.",Kitt
"The way things are going, it appears as if the Ceann Comhairle’s seat is the only safe one in the House. I wish him well in the new Dáil. For over a decade, the Government, in various shades, spent the public’s money in a wanton fashion. It never consulted or sought the advice of this side of the House. It never took on board the very many positive measures put forward by this side of the House. Now in the Government’s hour of need, it seeks our help for the good of the State. This is a Pauline conversion on its deathbed. Fine Gael believes the fiscal adjustment should be achieved through expenditure savings as opposed to tax increases. There is great scope for savings in the public service. People talk about fixing the political system. While there are steps to be taken in respect of the political system, its main fault is the practitioners therein. The system has worked in the past and can work in the future. We could spend another decade navel-gazing and return with the same system. The biggest weakness of this House is the failure to recognise the implications of measures we take on business and the business environment. Whatever Government is formed in the next few weeks will have to introduce a new finance Bill with measures to facilitate growth and the creation of jobs. To date, there have been cutbacks. We must address bureaucracy in the form of the Health and Safety Authority, NERA and all the bodies set up during the Celtic tiger years. There are measures we can take outside our economic remit that will have implications. Over the years during which I have been a Member, I have been harping on about the issue of early intervention in education. Our education system is going down the Swanee because of the failure in respect of numeracy and literacy in the primary curriculum. A report published in recent weeks identifies this problem. People ask me how this has happened and state we need another report to establish the facts. It happened because we have a curriculum that does not facilitate development. It is essential that the new Government introduce a finance Bill that will create hope, a stimulus and jobs. The difficulty in Britain in recent days will have an impact on our exports. Interest rates will probably increase in the coming year or so, thus affecting mortgage holders. There are many negatives on the horizon and this is why we need to instil confidence. Let us renegotiate and conclude the interest rate deal with the IMF as soon as we can in order to run our own affairs. I pay tribute to all those who are retiring. I am sorry I was not present for the speech of Deputy Edward O’Keeffe, who is a very outspoken man. I wish him, his colleagues, my colleagues on this side of the House and others well in the weeks ahead.",O'Keeffe
"I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion and compliment our justice spokesman, Deputy Flanagan, on tabling it. The three simple points made in it are a concise to do list, unlike the Government’s amendment. The third point deals with community policing, an issue on which I spoke briefly yesterday when the Minister agreed that [446]one of the first things to do was to establish a clearer definition of the role of community gardaí to distinguish them from gardaí in any other part of the force. Recognition is a key aspect of the community garda’s productive and meaningful role in society. We must first find a definition, then give longer assignments in order that such gardaí have stability in their job. To achieve this, the role of community gardaí must be recognised as worthwhile to their career paths. Some see them as second rate, or like the reserve force. Those who have a vocation for this role, as people do for medicine or teaching, should believe their career can progress through being community gardaí. There has been a problem for community gardaí in rural society which we in County Wicklow have tried to address by entitling them to receive planning permission or to live in a community. It is important that they live in a community and people know the face of the person they need to approach, as they know politicians. The community garda’s role is one of prevention rather than intervention. They are seen to be actively involved in communities, some of the social improvement programmes and youth clubs. I welcome the development of joint policing committees in the past 18 months because that principle establishes a link between public representatives, community representatives and the Garda. It is the duty of community gardaí to carry out whatever priorities the local authority joint policing force lays down and produce some form of tangible report on their progress. We all have a vision of what we would like for our communities but if we do not act now, we can predict where we will go. There used to be bumper stickers in rural communities stating 'crime doesn’t pay — neither does farming'. I do not know about either but ten or 12 years ago when the Criminal Assets Bureau was established, following the tragic murder of Veronica Guerin, it was considered criminals would not get away. We have seen Paul Williams’s recent television programmes on the subject. Unfortunately, it seems crime does pay again. People go through the revolving door they are in prison, come out and commit crime while on remand. They have no respect for the law. In County Wicklow we have an opportunity as a pilot scheme area because our division is being reformed. It was one of four divisions but now we will have one of our own and a blank page on which to work. The Fine Gael motion is focused on three points. The Government amendment opens with an expression of horror which we all share and sympathy for the victims of recent murders but goes on to 'welcome', 'note', 'endorse', 'acknowledge', 'look forward to' and 'support' the work done. This is aspirational waffle. The Government should support the focused motion.",Flanagan
"As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreements, the Government is committed to the full and effective implementation of all aspects of these Agreements, which provide the basis for sustainable peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Since the autumn, and throughout January, I have been involved in intensive efforts with my British counterpart, Shaun Woodward, to assist and encourage the Northern Ireland parties to complete the devolution of policing and justice and to address other outstanding aspects of the St. Andrew’s Agreement that still require implementation. The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister met on 17 December, on 14 January and again on 25 January. I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 5 January, 12 January and 19 January. [257]As the Deputy is aware, when it became clear that the parties themselves were unable to agree on how to move ahead, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister travelled from their meeting in London on 25 January to Hillsborough and convened all party talks. During the course of these talks I met with the leaders of all of the political parties in Northern Ireland with members of their Assembly Groups. During those talks we worked hard to establish common ground, to build dialogue between the parties, and to re-establish the trust necessary to complete the devolution of policing and justice in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement provided the foundation for peace and political progress. The St Andrews Agreement was a further major step forward. But a number of issues remain to be fully implemented. Resolving these issues is the key to enabling the completion of devolution and the opening of a new chapter in the political life of Northern Ireland. The devolved institutions can then focus on the issues that concern everyone — jobs, health, schools, social services, community safety. I do not pretend that this is an easy process. The issues we have been discussing go to the very core of Northern Ireland’s past, and their solutions are the foundations for Northern Ireland’s future. Progress has been made inch by inch, slowly but surely. We are determined to bring this process to completion. Having talked to all the leaders of Northern Ireland’s political parties, we believe there is a clear pathway to an agreement. It is right and necessary that the parties themselves now work together, in a spirit of trust and understanding, to agree and take ownership of the solutions. We believe there is now a firm basis for the parties to: set an early date for the completion of the final stage of devolution create a new Department of Justice and define the relationship between the Justice Minister and the Executive on an agreed, strong and sustainable footing benefit from the offer from the British Government of £800 million of resources for a new Department of Justice — money which is only available if agreement is reached by the parties at this time and enhance the existing framework to deal more effectively with contentious parades, learning lessons from successful local models. The importance of these decisions for the future of Northern Ireland cannot be underestimated. With leadership and courage, they can be achieved. A successful outcome to these talks will enable the political parties to work together in partnership and move forward towards a better Northern Ireland. Recent acts of decommissioning, most recently by the UDA on 6 January, remind us all of the great benefits that the peace process can bring and the confidence it generates in communities. The evil, criminal attack on PSNI Constable Peadar Heffron in recent weeks is a stark reminder that there remain those whose aim is to destroy all that has been achieved. The best response to give to such people is completing the devolution of policing and justice powers, securing the stability of the devolved institutions, and showing that the democratic political institutions are delivering for all of the people of Northern Ireland. Both Governments will continue to encourage, and work with, the parties to bring the outstanding issues to a successful resolution.",Andrews
"I support some of the comments made by the previous speaker. There are major questions over NAMA which need to be investigated and I am glad somebody on the Government side has admitted this. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Assets Management Agency Bill 2009, which is supposed to deal with what Deputy Brian Lenihan admitted to be one of the more serious issues in the history of the State. He claimed that some of the commentary on the Bill was misinformed and even mischievous. However, I assure the Minister that from speaking to people at both constituency and national level I know there is still much anxiety and real fear because of the failure of the Minister to clarify many of the issues about which he was asked at committee meetings and, since then, in his Second Stage speech. The Minister said the Government’s proposal to establish an assets management agency had received the backing of the IMF and the ECB. It has certainly received support for increasing its share of our two main banks, but there is no guarantee for taxpayers and no funding through the banks to keep small industries and businesses alive. Only this morning I met a businessman in Monaghan who manufactures and supplies goods for the housing sector to county councils in Dublin and further afield as well as to the private sector. He advised me that he would have to put his staff on a three-day week from next Monday, not because he is short of work but because he cannot get his payments in from either the private or the public sector. Clearly the banks are not giving the necessary finance even to public-sector building projects, which should be a sure bet. This means more people will end up on social welfare. Last night, together with my Oireachtas colleagues from County Monaghan, we met Castleblayney Town Council and the chamber of commerce, and it was simply impossible to explain to them how billions could already have been poured into the banking system while no relief is available for hard-pressed rate-payers in Castleblayney, which is on the Border and which receives the third lowest subvention in the whole of Ireland through the local government fund. During the discussion in Castleblayney regarding Irish and UK VAT rates and the price of alcohol, it was stated that 50% of alcohol sales in the island of Ireland are actually in the Six Counties. This is some indication of the loss of revenue occurring, especially in the Border area. We were also advised that business owners were not able to obtain the necessary capital to keep their businesses going. If NAMA does not provide this — and I do not believe it will — then some other rescue package must be put in place. Those in the Border region are extremely worried about the fact that NAMA does not cover banks such as Ulster Bank, National Irish Bank and ACC. In fact, NAMA does not cover any borrowings under €5 million. I am sure the number of people in the Border region owing more than €5 million will be quite small, thus all the banks, including Bank of Ireland and the AIB, will be taking their customers, including developers down the legal path, leading to forced sales at low levels. This has already happened as has been well publicised in Ballinagh a few miles outside Cavan town. People who bought houses only a year ago are now seeing similar houses in the same development being sold at less than half price. How will NAMA, as it is now [387]structured, deal with situations such as this and how can the Minister suggest that property prices are going to rise in the foreseeable future? This structure, whereby smaller groups are not underwritten will curtail increases in property prices because they are not receiving the same benefit. Several years ago, I brought to the notice of a number of people the expansion of the housing boom. In a constituency like mine, where little or no efforts were being made to maintain or produce permanent jobs, how could planners and for that matter builders and banks justify the mass production of houses? In late autumn 2006 and again in February 2007, as we approached the then general election, I raised this issue with senior colleagues and members of my own Frontbench and advised them of what would be the outcome in this regard. Anyone who at that time questioned the situation was accused by the then so-called saviour of Ireland of being negative and ill-informed. The former Taoiseach of our country, Deputy Bertie Ahern, advised them to go away and commit suicide. The property bubble could not and would not have existed without the involvement of incompetent senior bankers who convinced themselves that they knew everything and that they in turn deserved huge salaries and bonuses. It is impossible for the ordinary taxpayer to understand the role of the regulator or Central Bank in this regard. Across the whole Irish banking sector there was a failure at board level and the question must be asked if boards were properly or legally informed by senior management. One cannot help but believe that the principle of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator was to hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil. One cannot but believe that the whole ethos of the builders, developers and banks was laid down by the Galway tent brigade where everyone worked together with senior politicians in one big happy club. The then Taoiseach and then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, now the current Taoiseach, gave out the money from the building boom like there was no tomorrow and as if it was coming from a permanent genuine base. As far back as when the now European Commissioner Mr. Charlie McCreevy was Minister for Finance our party Leader Deputy Enda Kenny questioned the whole basis of the benchmarking structure and how it was put together but even then some of the relevant information had disappeared. We now find ourselves in a situation whereby people who benefited from the benchmarking structures, in particular young graduates, who purchased expensive houses with loans of up to 100% of the cost of an overpriced property find themselves with incomes inhibited by levies and pension funds and the benefit of mortgage relief removed. They now see themselves as victims of Government and bank mismanagement and they find it impossible to understand how bankers and developers are in reality the people who are being rescued. I have no doubt they as taxpayers, together with their children and grandchildren, will have to pay for Government mismanagement and for the mismanagement of banks and developers. While I appreciate there are some investigations into the activities of some people in Anglo Irish Bank and, possibly others, it takes a long time to come to grips with white collar fraud. No one can call it anything less. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated in his Second Stage speech that the citizens of this country are understandably angry about the state of the banks. They are bitterly disappointed by the failure of our regulatory system and are appalled by the details of the reprehensible behaviour of some in the financial system and property sector in whom they placed their trust. They are also angry with the Government. Many ask why we are putting money into the banks while they endure the brunt of the difficult budgetary decisions which must be taken. [388]There is now, unfortunately, a breakdown of trust in the entire system, as was evident when we were out canvassing on the Lisbon treaty. My colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, asked on 22 September what is the logic of using over €36 billion in taxpayers’ money — 40% of the total NAMA bonds — to purchase toxic assets from two broken financial institutions, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, that are almost certain never to lend again? What is the Government’s strategy for these two broken institutions? What binding mechanisms can NAMA impose on the other banks to use the extra funding from the ECB to finance lending to households and struggling businesses rather than paying down other expensive sources of funding from international markets? I want to return to an issue I raised earlier regarding the non-Irish banks. It is impossible for me representing a Border constituency to understand how NAMA can be responsible for one-fifth of its assets in Great Britain, 6% in Northern Ireland, only two-thirds in Ireland and the remainder in the USA and Europe. According to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, those developers and customers dealing with the Ulster Bank, NIB and ACC are being ignored on the basis that they will be supported from their home base in the UK, New Zealand or Denmark. I would urge that this situation be re-examined as a matter of urgency to ensure there is no further damage to the Border area. If all the non-national banks follow the lead of ACC and withdraw their services from the area this will minimise competition in the long term. Of course, it will be customers, in particular small businesses, that will suffer. I believe the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, must, as has already been requested of him by Deputy Richard Bruton, contact his UK, Danish and other colleagues to ensure pressure is put on these banks to deal sympathetically with their customers in Ireland. One other cross-Border group I must mention is the Presbyterian Mutual Society, which was clearly undermined by the introduction of guarantees to other banks. This group has a number of investors from the Border region, some of whom are in serious situations since it was put into administration. I am aware that the group’s interests are under discussion at British Cabinet level and I, once again, urge the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance to show their interest in this issue as the amount of money needed to allow this organisation to survive in the interests of small investors is quite small. Clearly, the percentage of the funds in this all-Ireland institution from south of the Border would mean that any involvement by the Irish Government would be minimum as compared with the billions being committed elsewhere. While I appreciate that if Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Independents, such as Deputy Mary Harney stick together the Bill will be passed through Second Stage, I urge the Minister and his officials to take seriously the well-intentioned, constructive amendments being but forward by my party Leader, Deputy Enda Kenny and our finance spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton. They proved on 29 September 2008, when called on by the Taoiseach to support the introduction of the State guarantee, that they can put the country first. Deputy Bruton’s proposal for an economic recovery bank is clearly getting generous support from serious business people and economic advisors. In that context, one must be concerned to hear the Minister say that NAMA has been drawn up on the best expert advice and counsel available to the Government. Where was this expert advice and counsel during the past number of years which allowed us to walk blindfolded into this mess? We can only hope different personnel are involved. With regard to Anglo Irish Bank and the type of personnel that were advising the Government on this issue, how can Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, be so sure that Mr. Seán Fitzpatrick of Anglo Irish Bank will repay, to use his words 'every cent' that he owes the current bank? If Mr. Fitzpatrick is unable to meet full interest payments on an estimated loan of €106 million, how will he ever be able to repay the capital? It is difficult for someone [389]under pressure to pay his mortgage to listen to Deputy Brian Lenihan making such comments when he knows that such repayments will not happen while nothing will be done for mortgage holders. Imagine the situation for someone who had a high interest fixed rate mortgage who is now being told he will have to pay a further increase when the fixed term is over. The Minister and the Government have a major job to do to establish NAMA and, more importantly, to get it to work so business, jobs and private borrowers can see the benefit. We will not tax our way out of this situation, we will only lose more jobs. I was amazed to hear the leader of the Green Party on TV3 saying the Government would not deviate from the norm for Seán Fitzpatrick or anyone else. What is the norm? What was the norm as far as these people were concerned? 6 o’clock I received an e-mail asking why only loans over €5 million qualify for NAMA. What will happen to development loans of less than €5 million from Bank of Ireland or AIB Bank, the person asked. He wanted to know if these banks will be instructed by Government to offer the same terms to holders of loans under €5 million as those offered by NAMA to holders of loans over €5 million. The Minister for Finance in his speech to the Dáil referred particularly to the past conduct of the banks, as well as the distressed assets of developers as a consequence of the failure of the banking system and the economy. Surely this applies equally to those who owe development loans of less than €5 million, asked the person who wrote to me. How can we make fish of one and flesh of the other, he wanted to know. For many, answers to these questions are critical. I have already stated that Ulster Bank, NIB and ACC should be included in these questions. When the banks came before the committees some time ago, everyone was assured that they were sound. The Comptroller and Auditor General and all these different people were in before the committees and we were assured there was no problem. I fully understand there have been international situations but they were not the main cause of our problem. I support the Irish Farmers’ Association in its opposition to a proposed 80% capital gains tax. This is a serious situation. Many good farms were divided by road building or similar infrastructure projects. The land was taken through a CPO and now 80% of that money would have to be paid to the Government. What will be left to restructure the farm or buy somewhere else? This must be examined. It is not a windfall if someone is forced to sell property, leaving his farm not viable. It is back hand work that such a suggestion should be brought in through the backdoor as an amendment to the Bill. The idea must be reviewed because it will not bring in any money. The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, used to blow about the lowering of taxes and how that led to an increase in receipts because there were more transactions. Here, capital gains tax will increase from 20% to 80%. It is absolutely outrageous and will hit farming and rural communities hardest. It will destroy any opportunities they may have and I beg the Minister of State, as someone with responsibility for agricultural matters, to deal with this promptly. It is up to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to make sure this ridiculous proposal does not go through this House. It is unacceptable, unrealistic and will cause serious problems. There is someone there who wants to get at the farming community and we must cry 'stop' somewhere.",Lenihan
"I compliment my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, for bringing this very opportune motion before the House. As a general observation, we have to come before this House too many times in terms of issues to do with special needs. I wish the Minister well and she has an opportunity to set out, in a defining moment, precisely what her incumbency as Minister for Education and Skills will be about. We have to look after people with special needs. Many students and parents are here today from across the length and breadth of the country. Countless numbers of people are coming to me in my constituency, Limerick East, who are extremely worried about SNAs being withdrawn from their children. Inspections are ongoing, some of them have got the results while others have not. The Minister has to make a commitment tonight to put an appeals process in place and ensure that children can achieve their optimal capacity. As a parent, the Minister can appreciate that this is what is required. We cannot have a situation where if an SNA is withdrawn from a child, he or she will regress. The child will have been allocated the SNA, at the outset, to ensure that he or she could achieve optimal potential. Therefore, this is imperative. On a final point, some €8 billion has been put into Anglo Irish Bank by the Government since 21 January this year. That is equivalent to the Minister’s entire budget in one year. The Government needs to get its priorities right.",Hayes
"It is important that the Minister should indicate to the House whether the commitments given in the programme for Government on reducing the staff schedule this year, next year and the following year will be put in place. I specifically refer to commitments that should be honoured in 2009. Many schools will lose a teacher or two this year because of the Government’s failure to honour its promises. I also will refer to a promise made in respect of post-primary education. A unequivocal commitment was made by the Minister’s former leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, at the Ard-Fheis before the recent election that a reduction in class size would take place in respect of the core subjects of Irish, English and mathematics in post-primary education.",Ahern
"There will not be that many of them. It is a fairly simple exercise for the authority to consider. In the vast majority of cases there will not be an issue. As long as we leave matters are they are under the old system, where a real substantive issue arises, it will be dealt with in a certain way, as occurred in a case of a man who was in jail for two or three years but he had known his children at a very early part of their lives and the adoption order has already been effected. If one were to put the child at the centre of that equation, one would say that the better solution would have been to require the Adoption Board to refer the matter to the High Court for the issue to be properly assessed as early as possible in the life of the child to ensure that the child’s best interests would be served in the process rather than any considerations about resource implications. With regard to the point raised by Deputy O’Sullivan regarding a birth certificate, section 22 of the Civil Registration Act provides that the father of a child who was not married to the mother of the child at the date of his or her birth or at any time during the period of ten months before such birth shall not be required to give information about the birth. The registrar shall enter the father’s details in the register if the mother and father jointly request this or on the production to the registrar of a court order or statutory declaration naming the father of the child. No legal rights accrue to the father by being named in the birth certificate. The father has to apply for and be granted guardianship under the Act in order for his consent to an adoption to be required. We do not wish to do anything in this legislation that might discourage fathers from agreeing to their name being included on the child’s birth certificate.",O'Sullivan
"I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which is a complex one. I reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who unfortunately cannot be present. This provides an opportunity to bring additional clarity to what is a complex issue.",Lenihan
"I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Joe McHugh — if the relevant Minister will outline the Government’s commitment to decentralisation throughout rural Ireland what is the Minister’s commitment to retaining existing State jobs in peripheral locations and furthermore, his commitment to providing additional jobs in these locations (2) Deputy Martin Ferris — the loss of 50 jobs at factory (details supplied) in Tralee (3) Deputies Pat Breen and Joe Carey — the reason funding has been suspended for a new school in Ballyea, County Clare (4) Deputy John Perry — whether the Minister for Health and Children will now take up the issue of cross-Border co-operation in the provision of the full range of cancer care services covering all the midland and Border counties and, in particular, fully explore the provision of specialist cancer care services from Sligo Hospital to patients from Fermanagh (5) Deputy Ciarán Lynch — when the Minister for Education and Science intends to appoint a design team for the construction of a new national school in Cork (details supplied), an area of rapid population growth and will she indicate a completion date is she aware that nine families from the parish could not be offered junior infant places for 2008 that junior infant places are greatly over subscribed for 2009 and 2010 is she also aware that a suitable site has been donated which has been adjudged by the planning and building unit of the Department as suitable for a new 12-classroom school and will she make a statement on the matter (6) Deputies Paul Connaughton, Jimmy Deenihan and James Bannon — the consequences of the EU decision to withdraw the refund of excise duty on fuel used in passenger transport services (7) Deputy Jimmy Deenihan — the withdrawal of the fuel rebate relating to school transport by [1601]private operators from 31 December 2007 and its implications for the school transport service in the 2008-9 school year (8) Deputy James Bannon — the relevant Minister to outline what plans he has to alleviate the hardship caused by the sudden removal of the refund of excise duty on fuel used in passenger transport services, which will seriously impact on the private transport industry leading to increased fares and the closure of many businesses (9) Deputy Seymour Crawford — the urgent need to discuss the proposed interconnection 400KV cables and pylons going through counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan to county Tyrone and its possible effects on people, property and the future of the region.

"Department Decentralisation. My Department has been making good progress in the relocation of the required 250 posts to Carlow under the Government’s Decentralisation Programme. The following business units/Offices of my Department are earmarked for decentralisation: Companies Registration Office/Registry of Friendly Societies National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) Work Permits Redundancy Payments Section Insolvency Payments Section. Officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007. The number of posts in this decentralised advance office is 100. As well as staff already decentralised, there are 48 staff within my Department due to decentralise in the substantive move scheduled for 2009, with a further 42 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned from other Departments. With regard to the property side of the Department’s move, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre for the construction of my Department’s permanent office in Carlow. My colleague Minister of State Noel Ahern TD, announced on 13th December 2007 that the OPW has invited The Macquarie Partnership as the consortium to become the ‘Successful Tenderer’ in respect of this decentralisation project. This forms part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar. The OPW has advised my Department that the formal application for planning permission was lodged with Carlow Town Council on Friday 18th April 2008. I am hopeful, subject to no planning issues arising, that the completion of construction of the permanent office will be in late 2009. Agency Decentralisation. Under the Government Decentralisation Programme, announced in December 2003, six of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise or have already been decentralised, as follows: National Consumer Agency (NCA). The National Consumer Agency (NCA) was formally established on 1st May 2007 and inherited the functions of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs (ODCA). The Agency will have a headquarters in Cork City. The Department of Finance has granted sanction for an overall complement of 80 members of staff. The NCA expects that there will be over 90% staff [341]turnover as many of the existing staff, who formerly worked in ODCA and are on secondment from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, return to the Department. Decentralisation plans are being progressed with a view to the Agency relocating to Cork in the course of 2009. The Agency has forwarded details of its accommodation requirements to the OPW and hopes to shortly identify a suitable property in Cork. FÁS FÁS is due to transfer its Head Office including some 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly. FÁS has completed the purchase of 5. 59 acres (approximately) in Birr, Co Offaly. A Planning Application is currently being progressed on behalf of FÁS by the vendor’s Consultant Engineers and Architects, in discussion with the Consulting Engineers and Architects representing FÁS. In the meantime, since 6 May 2007 FÁS has leased a floor of a building within the Birr Technology Centre to accommodate staff in the decentralised location pending the construction and fitting out of the permanent Headquarters. There are currently 22 Head Office staff based in these premises, which has capacity for approximately 40 staff. Enterprise Ireland Enterprise Ireland (EI) is to move 300 posts to Shannon under the decentralisation programme. Progress on the full transfer of EI’s HQ to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by factors (many exogenous to EI) such as the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and by progress made discussions at a central level on various issues central to Agency decentralisation. EI’s latest understanding is that there are 7 internal applicants interested in moving to Shannon. None of these has yet re-located. In parallel with the decentralisation programme, EI has been strengthening its regional focus in recent years. EI now has a major new presence in the Shannon region in addition to its nine other regional offices. In July 2007 EI officially opened its new National Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and has based the new County Enterprise Support Unit there. Currently there are 40 staff working in the new Shannon office and it is expected that approximately 65 EI staff will be in place there over the coming months. EI has leased high-spec office space in Westpark, Shannon, to accommodate this new Regional HQ. In terms of acquiring a building, Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW) has identified, but not yet acquired, a preferred site for the construction of a suitably sized new HQ building in Shannon. The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development. In co-operation with Shannon Development and the OPW, the site was valued and a feasibility study carried out. The site occupies a prime position in Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure. Health and Safety Authority The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co Kilkenny as part of the decentralisation programme. In anticipation of the move to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city and to date 27 staff decentralised to that office are awaiting transfer to Thomastown, when the new premises there are completed. The current situation is that the Thomastown site purchase is about to be completed. No premises occupation date has yet been agreed with the OPW. NSAI Under the Government’s decentralisation programme the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is due to relocate to Arklow, Co. Wicklow. The number required to decentral[342]ise from the NSAI is 132. A total of 10 staff of the NSAI have applied to decentralise to Arklow. In addition a further 86 civil and public servants have applied for decentralisation to Arklow. No staff from the NSAI has transferred to Arklow to date. The accommodation requirements for the NSAI in Arklow are being addressed by the OPW. To date no progress has been made by the OPW in identifying or securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area. The current NSAI implementation plan anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date. Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) In the case of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), a decision was made prior to its establishment that it would be located in Naas, Co Kildare. Having been established in December, 2005 it moved to new offices at Naas, in January 2006. All IAASA staff have been based in its offices in Naas since its establishment, and as such the Authority is fully decentralised.",Ahern

"I put it to the Minister of State that this 10% cutback across the board may see many of these 180 special projects going to the wall. That cannot be allowed to happen [867]under any circumstances but this budget, allegedly, was supposed to safeguard the front line and the most vulnerable children. Will the Minister of State agree to meet urgently with the National Youth Council of Ireland? The NYCI is the umbrella organisation for all the other good organisations throughout the country. The Minister of State might explain to the NYCI how, exactly, the budget for 2009 is to be constructed and, more important, how it will affect the 180 different organisations. There may well be an argument that some national bodies can provide some of the required savings. The Minister of State, more than anybody, would be prepared to dialogue with those national organisations. I ask him to sit down over the course of the next few weeks with the NYCI in order to see if an agreement can be found to safeguard these 180 organisations that help the most vulnerable children of all in our constituencies. There is also a need to ensure that the organisations that run these services can know their budget for 2009 as expeditiously as possible. Last year many of them were not given a budget until well into the summer months when half of their service had already been provided. That was a scandal and is no way to treat the youth service. In good times or bad, there is cross-party consensus that these organisations must be supported. Unfortunately, this budget falls between two stools because neither the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, nor the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Andrews, takes responsibility for the youth service budget.",Andrews

"I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1: To delete paragraphs 4 to 15 and substitute the following: '—believes that Government failures have resulted in serious drug, gun and knife crime becoming a growing concern in all parts of the state believes central Government, an Garda Síochána, local authorities and all relevant statutory bodies must prioritise serious drug, gun and knife crime, anti-social or anti-community behaviour and domestic and sexual violence is of the view that an Garda Síochána must work in full partnership with communities if crime is to be tackled effectively and community safety enhanced calls on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to complete, in consultation with communities and as a matter of urgency, a comprehensive review of the availability of knives and offensive weapons demands the Government resource An Garda Síochána to mount a six month targeted operation to tackle the proliferation of knifes and similar offensive weapons in co-operation with the PSNI demands the number of Gardaí employed full-time on community policing be increased and measures brought forward to address the difficulties involved in filling such positions with the right candidates and reversing the high turnover in this post by changing Garda perceptions of the post and its status through, for example, alterations to the current norms governing promotions and career development in an Garda Síochána mandates: greater civilianisation of the force to free up fully-trained Gardaí a more visible presence of Gardaí in the community that the resources of local Garda drugs units be at least doubled and greater investment in prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and reducing the supply of illegal drugs.' [91]The effect of the amendment to amendment No. 1 will be to undo what the Government is attempting through its head-in-the-sand approach and to reintroduce some of the proposals put forward by Fine Gael. It will also go beyond the latter in order to ensure that which we are debating, and that upon which we will vote, represents a proper response rather than an approach such as that to which I refer. The Government and its spokespersons and backbenchers do not seem to be aware of the extent of violent crime in our society. If they were, they would not have had the audacity to table amendment No. 1, which is a disgrace. We are discussing this motion on the back of the public’s revulsion at the reprehensible murder of two Polish men in my constituency. At the same time, however, the Government is praising itself for all the good things it has done. It is time the Government woke up to the extent of the problem. Like Deputy Catherine Byrne, I can discuss matters with my constituents. I invite the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to engage in such discussions with their constituents. This problem does not just relate to Drimnagh, Ballyfermot or wherever. If Ministers got out of their ministerial cars on occasion and spoke to people, they would be aware that their constituents are living in fear and that elderly individuals are no longer prepared to go to the shops on their own. They will also discover that the Garda does not respond quickly enough for most people. By the time gardaí arrive on the scene — one or two hours or perhaps more later — the perpetrators of crime have left. In many instances, the young people who are out of their heads on cocaine and who are hassling others at chip shops or outside pubs or off-licences or who are engaging in raves outside people’s houses have usually dispersed by the time officers arrive. I accept that An Garda Síochána is struggling because of a lack of resources. In addition, its members do not have proper equipment. The Minister praised himself earlier, stated how great he is and highlighted the amount of money that has been invested in An Garda Síochána. The force does not even have a half decent radio system to allow its members to communicate with each another and with their barracks. Gardaí are obliged to use their own mobile phones to maintain contact. However, the Minister earlier lauded his response and that of the Garda. Successive Governments were content to pass law after law but they failed to focus on the causes of crime. Neither did they place an emphasis on why the continual increase in violent crime. Lack of respect, materialism and drug and alcohol misuse are some of the causes of crime. People are engaging in gratuitous, mindless thuggery and violence. A much greater level of resources needs to be pumped into crime prevention measures, drug schemes, the provision of services to the victim of crime, rehabilitation, and diversionary programmes. If proper investment is made in these areas, results will be forthcoming. Since I was first elected in 2002, I have called for the adoption of an approach similar to that taken in respect of foot and mouth disease. We should take an all-hands-on-deck approach to the scourge of drugs. We must recall the promise that foot and mouth disease would not kill a solitary soul. However, drugs and gun-related crime are destroying our communities. All organs of the State should be mobilised to tackle drug-related crime head on. In the opinion of most gardaí and criminologists, approximately 70% of crime in our society is drug related. We should, therefore, tackle the causes and deal with what is causing people to become involved in drug abuse and drink more and more alcohol. If we do this and take steps to confiscate the profits of the drugs barons, we will have achieved something worthwhile. This Government and its predecessors stand indicted for their failures. In the 1980s when communities cried out for help and eventually took to the streets, the Government response was to batter them down. We still do not have a proper response to the drug crisis in this or any other city. Individual communities and Sinn Féin have continually flagged the need for a [92]proper response. I am sure we could turn the tide if such a response was forthcoming. If we do not tackle this problem, it will become much worse and we will witness further events similar to those in Drimnagh. I appeal to Ministers to get real and not to engage in self-praise when tabling amendments. The Government should put in place proper responses. The necessary laws and gardaí are in place. We should direct the latter to where the problems lie. We need to focus on community policing. On Question Time, the Minister referred to the effectiveness of community policing. If it is so effective, why can he not demand that the Garda Commissioner, as is the case with the traffic corps, ring-fence the number of community gardaí? If we deploy sufficient numbers of community gardaí, we will be able to rebuild the confidence of communities in the force as a whole. In addition, we will be in a position to bring to an end people’s fear in respect of approaching An Garda Síochána. People need to have confidence in An Garda Síochána in order that they can work with individual officers and ensure they are effective not only in policing communities but in ensuring that crime does not occur in the first instance. The most effective way to tackle anti-social behaviour is to provide communities and the victims of crime with an assurance that the State will protect them. For over a year, I have been calling for a pilot scheme initiated in Blanchardstown to be rolled out elsewhere. I refer to the 'Dial to Stop Drug Dealing' scheme, under which an anonymous telephone line was provided to encourage those who feared approaching An Garda Síochána or using ordinary telephone lines to share information with the force on drugs or drug-related crime. People who used the special telephone line could not be identified and could not then become targets for mindless thugs. The pilot scheme in Blanchardstown led to the arrest and prosecution of many drug dealers. This is a great scheme but the Minister will not put his money where his mouth is in respect of it. Rolling the scheme out across the city, or the country in general, would not cost a great deal. If it was rolled out, communities and individuals living in fear would have an avenue by which to report crime. If it only led to the imprisonment of one drug dealer or one violent criminal, it would still be worth it. I stated earlier that almost 70% of crime is drug related. In such circumstances, any action which frustrates this multi-billion euro industry and the crime associated with it must be welcomed. Every shipment of drugs that enters this country seems to be accompanied by a huge number of weapons. We have not previously seen the importation of these illegal weapons, which are being used on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere, on such a scale. The availability of such weapons is leading to violence, shootings and murder. One need only consider what has happened in Drimnagh and Dublin South-Central in this regard in recent times. An ongoing drugs feud in the area, which has not been properly dealt with, has led to 11 people being killed. In addition, a doorman and a garda were shot by those involved in the feud. These drug-fueled crimes would not have happened if the Government or its predecessors had taken seriously calls for a proper approach to be adopted. The scale of the lawlessness in Dublin city, particularly in the community I represent, is such that criminals are driving around tooled up with weapons and wearing bullet-proof vests. Only a small minority is engaged in this type of activity. Most people are law-abiding but live in fear because of the State’s failure to stand up to those involved in drug crime. The example they give to the young, alcohol-fuelled criminals coming up behind them is that it is okay to carry on in this way. It is not okay. If the State is not willing to come up to the mark, communities will have to take to the streets as they did in the 1980s. We have learnt our lessons from that [93]period but if all arms of the State are not willing to stand up, the communities will take to the streets and ensure that this violent trend and the increasing drug scourge are tackled head on. Debate adjourned.",Byrne
"I welcome the Minister to the House. I hope he uses his high office to extend this communiqué to his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, to whom I have spoken off the record on this matter. This is not a new issue. The secretary general of the INTO, John Carr, who is also a native of Donegal, recently wrote an article on the challenges we are facing with regard to student capacity within the primary school sector in the greater Letterkenny area. Letterkenny is establishing itself as a gateway town under the gateway status initiative in conjunction with Derry. If we are to consider our spatial strategy in any comprehensive and methodical way we should critically examine what has happened in Letterkenny in terms of demographics and population growth in recent years. While I acknowledge the fact that many schools in Letterkenny, such as Ballyraine national school, benefited from recent infrastructural investment, other schools are still in need of significant investment and extension. In particular, I mention two schools, St. Colmcille’s boys’ school and Lurgybrack national school. These schools are coming under increasing pressures and I could list the reasons for this all night. They include inward migration from other parts of Donegal where people had difficulty obtaining planning permission and were restricted from building in their own rural areas. We are looking at an ever-expanding younger generation. At St. Colmcille’s boys’ school, 63 students have come forward for enrolment this year. The school faces another year in the unfortunate position of having to turn away students. It has a history of appeals and a tradition of facilitating as many people as possible. However, the capacity is not there. Letterkenny was the fastest growing town in Europe until recent years. The greater Letterkenny area has a population of approximately 20,000 and we need infrastructure. This highlights another part of the challenge we face as a country. We do not necessarily have an east coast urban problem. Various parts of the island have the same population pressures as the east coast. I refer to a research proposal at DIT which suggested that in 20, 40 or 50 years’ time the balance will be between an urban east coast and a rural west coast. I can tell the Minister this is not the case. Donegal, and Letterkenny in particular, is situated 20 miles from Derry, the fourth largest city in Ireland. Derry city has an urban sprawl and Letterkenny caters for students originally from Derry. Within the greater Letterkenny area we also have integration and a social mix for which we must cater. Will the Minister speak to his colleague? I know in his reply he will speak about projection appraisals and evaluations of population density. The schools have provided their own analysis and produced their own projections. They are there in black and white. These schools are not in a position to cope with added pressures. They do not want to turn away students and they want to carry on in the manner they have for generations. The Minister is in the Cabinet. Today, it was stated that capital projects will not be affected by any measures being introduced. This commitment must be extended to the Department of Education and Science. I hear there is little money for capital projects. In the economic circum[107]stances we face we must use imagination and creativity to cater for students being turned away from schools against the wishes of principals and boards of management.",O'Keeffe
"I thank Deputy Brady for sharing his time with me and am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. I wish to pick up on one of the points made by Deputy Brady, namely, consultation with young people. This is a relatively new idea. I was brought up at a time when many households held that young people should be seen but not heard, although our household was one where everybody spoke on everything. I commend the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, and the young people who participated in her survey which demonstrates that, throughout the provinces, the main concerns of young people are families and care. I found that interesting. Mr. Fergus Finlay is doing excellent work with young people through the organisation Barnardos. There was criticism from some speakers who demand more action from the Minister of State with responsibility for children. He has assembled all the schemes, outlets and ideas rel[90]evant to young people and we will have action on those issues. The main cause of concern for me is that no matter how many good schemes or innovative projects we have, they only reach a certain percentage of the youth population. This means we always have some who do not get involved. This is often because of a lack of parental interest in what is going on or lack of finance to purchase the required gear for something such as sports activities. I suggest to all involved in this area that they should watch out for those who cannot, through no fault of their own, participate fully. These are the people who fall through the cracks and whom we read about some months later when some disaster has befallen them. Young people are often incorrectly portrayed as know-alls or smart. I noted from the Dáil book that was launched last night that there are 18 second level teachers and 13 primary teachers, 31 in all, in the Houses. Anybody who has ever taught, particularly at second level — I say to Deputy Brady that I am not decrying those who taught at primary level — learns very quickly that children have a facade of being wonderful and smart, but they are not. They want to be like their peers, to appear brave and courageous and give the impression that they understand everything, but behind that facade they are hurting. Often they cannot find someone in whom they can confide and to whom they can tell their story. The business of childhood, growing up and services for young people are hugely complex. Children cannot be put in a box, given A, B, C and D and then emerge as perfect adults. I commend the Minister of State on what he is doing in the Office of the Minister for Children. It is a very good idea. There were attempts in other Governments to bring together the various Departments but it never actually worked. It is the setting up of the office which is important and the far-seeing role of the Minister of State. I hope you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I can make an impact in the committee on the rights of children when it is up and running. 4 o’clock",Brady
"I support this Bill which should have the effect of fundamentally changing our culture by ensuring that everyone who gets behind the wheel of a car does so in the full knowledge that new penalties will be imposed for certain driving behaviours. As a result of this legislation, those who drink will have to significantly change their behaviour. We need to modify how we, as a society, deal with the issue of alcohol and the only way to achieve this objective is to ensure there is no ambiguity about the blood alcohol limits that apply while driving. Having served on Cork County Council with him, I have the greatest respect for the previous speaker, Deputy Christy O’Sullivan. I, too, am only too well aware of the conditions experienced by rural dwellers who are frequently disadvantaged by virtue of their rural isolation and experience a lack of access to services. I find it difficult to listen to Government Deputies deplore the state of rural roads and the problem of rural isolation. If people are to have access to the services they will require as a result of the measures provided for in the Bill, we must ensure ancillary services are in place to meet their demands and needs. For instance, in my area Bus Éireann has decided to withdraw the No. 66 route which serves a rural area and individuals living in rural isolation. They include older people who travel to towns such as Fermoy, Ballyhooly and Castletownroche to enjoy a drop before taking a bus home later in the evening. Many of these people do not drive and will no longer have access to the service as a result of the decision to close the route. This problem is a function of Government policy because an ancillary rural transport programme is not in place to pick up the slack arising from the loss of the service. In particular, a night time bus service is not in place to facilitate those who want to act responsibility but are unable to avail of a bus service. Government policy militates against the very people who experience rural isolation. [103]We need to be clear about the implications of the legislation. If we support the Bill on the basis that driver behaviour must change significantly, we must also take into account that some people, by virtue of residing in rural areas and deciding to behave responsibly as required under the legislation, will no longer have access to the local pub. Current policy does not meet their needs. If Bus Éireann drops routes at a rate of knots and the rural transport programme is not rolled out quickly enough to pick up the slack, particularly with regard to night time services, those who live in the rural areas obviously will be affected. This issue needs to be teased out in greater detail. On the commencement of the sections which will become operational before mid-2011, I refer to the Bills digest produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Unit. It states: . . . different sections may become operational before others. Some of the provisions of the Bill will not come into force until mid 2011. This is because evidential breath-testing (EBT) machines used in Garda stations to measure the alcohol in a driver’s breath cannot be recalibrated to the 20mg/100mL limit as yet. What is the current state of play with regard to the Garda’s capacity to recalibrate the EBT machines as required? I understand the legislation reduces blood alcohol limits and introduces mandatory alcohol testing for drivers who are involved in traffic collisions as well as roadside preliminary impairment testing to detect drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. One would expect the Government to have ensured all necessary technology was available prior to or in parallel with the implementation of the legislation. Will the Minister provide an update on the Garda’s capacity to use the required technology? On road collision statistics, while I do not doubt the bona fides of the Road Safety Authority, I have a healthy scepticism about some of the statistics produced on road traffic accidents. The Government has stated its commitment to improving road safety and the number of deaths on Irish roads declined to 240 in 2009. It is estimated that 25% of road accidents and 33% of fatal road accidents are attributable to alcohol. I often wonder how such statistics are measured and what process is used by the Road Safety Authority or Garda Síochána to produce their statistics, particularly those relating to road fatalities. I am not sceptical about the figures but I question the qualitative methods used to compile the statistics used for making an argument for a particular proposal. I ask for a response in that regard. I welcome the provisions on new drivers. We cannot disregard the link between driver impairment and alcohol consumption. It has been proven scientifically and is supported by anecdotal evidence. Common sense says that if a person imbibes, their ability to operate a machine or vehicle will be impaired. The Vintners’ Federation of Ireland opposed the reduction in the limit and I can see its point. Anecdotal evidence suggests that their regular rural customers might drink a pint and a drop before ambling home. They never go beyond their usual level of imbibing, which is a social outlet for them. We must be able to provide for those who use the pub as a social outlet. If they are not able to drive, how will we facilitate them? Some of them will be able to get taxis while others will travel with neighbours. However, do we now have to tell them that there is no other alternative? In implementing the legislation, we need to strike a balance and speak for those people as well. The section creates a distinction between newly qualified and other full licence holders. Novice drivers are subject to a lower BAC and will be automatically disqualified for three months if an administrative fixed penalty is accepted, or disqualified for six months if found [104]guilty after a court hearing. Other licence holders do not face automatic disqualification following a first conviction. Can the Minister of State clarify if this is an age-related distinction, or does it merely distinguish between novices and experienced drivers? Is any qualification brought into play concerning an older person who may have transgressed? It is not that I am advocating a particular position on that, but I am seeking clarification in the Minister of State’s response. On balance we are experiencing a serious erosion of services in rural areas. Some argue that the decline of the rural pub reflects a decline in overall infrastructure, particularly roads. As someone who meets members of the public every day, I hold that view myself, because they are finding it increasingly difficult to access services. That is particularly the case for older people. I would distinguish between older and elderly people, because the use of the word 'elderly' sometimes implies a certain infirmity. Many older people are mobile, although they may not drive. We always had a sense of inter-generational solidarity in this country, but it is being undermined by stealth. When drafting legislation we must, therefore, ensure that if it impacts on one service we should try to replace it with another service if possible. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that lives are saved and one cannot qualify that. While it is a black and white issue, there are grey areas where some public services will be diminished. Government policy on rural transport should be structured in such a way that people can access community centres or pubs outside normal office hours if they wish to do so. We must facilitate them in this respect.",O'Sullivan
"I thank Deputy Naughten for sharing his time with me. I also wish to highlight the plight of many elderly parents and siblings in the Ballinasloe and south Roscommon area who care for young adults and children with learning disabilities. The Brothers of Charity have indicated that a cutback of €2. 75 million will have to be imposed this year. Such a restriction would make it impossible to deliver the services to which people are accustomed. Over the years, these parents have begged and cajoled various Ministers to provide funding for the services needed by such people. As Deputy Naughten said, care is required in many cases 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. What are elderly parents supposed to do if these services are closed? Will the Government take responsibility for making provision for the most vulnerable people in our society, who need help now? Many elderly parents are worried about what will happen to their children when they have moved on. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Michael Kitt, is familiar with the issues in the Ballinasloe area. The same cutbacks have been suffered by each of this country’s 60 voluntary organisations that assists children with learning disabilities. How can any Minister or Government stand over such cuts? I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, will clearly outline in his reply that emergency funding is to be provided to allow these parents to get some relief.",Andrews

"I was not one of the senior Ministers who took part in those negotiations. All I can say is that all successful negotiations take considerable time to conclude.

However, Deputy Hayes can rest assured that the figure remains at 500.",Hayes
"The part-time cleaners in the courts, the gardaí, the tip staff and clerical staff in the courts will all be taking the hit. The judges will have a choice. They will receive what may be termed a 'sweetie-pie' letter from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, [732]whenever he recovers, suggesting that they might think about making a contribution to the State’s coffers. We are all aware of the provision in the Constitution stating judges should never be put under pressure by politicians who are or are not in power regarding influencing their judgments. They are meant to be independent and should act independently. We have a Judiciary which has always acted without fear or favour towards any politician, political party or group of politicians, which is as it should be. The protection afforded to the Judiciary in the Constitution against their pay being arbitrarily reduced is to stop an over-weaning Executive punishing a judge because he or she made a judgment which goes against its wishes, following which it may seek to restrain him or her. We are not discussing such a situation, which is what the Constitution provides for. We are examining a situation whereby judges — at least 50% of whom share this general view — no less than those who work with them in the public service are willing to take their share of the burden of pain and adjustment which has to be taken to get us out of the economic mess created by Fianna Fáil and its banker and developer friends. That appears to be the position of a majority of our judges. It is wrong that there is no provision in the Bill to explicitly encourage judges, as the Labour Party amendment seeks to do and is therefore perfectly constitutional, to consider their position and the appropriate response from people who are very well paid, looked after and appointed. Judges are a core part of the democratic functioning of our State. Nonetheless, they ought to share in the burden of adjustment given that they are well paid and looked after in terms of their pay and pensions. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, and the Taoiseach have suggested that the Government has received opinions from the Attorney General that it is not possible to touch the pay of judges. The Labour Party amendment seeks to acknowledge that, nevertheless I have outlined the reasons why I believe judges’ pay can be addressed. This is belling the cat. The Minister of State is very willing to be tough on contract workers and low-paid part-time workers and has said how good such a tough approach is. However, there is a softly-softly approach to the Judiciary. There is a simple remedy open to the Government, that is, to legislate for this measure and allow any judge who wishes to do so to take a legal challenge. They, more than almost every other person Irish society, are well-equipped to launch a legal challenge to overturn a pay cut for judges, as there is for everybody else in the public service. If that happens, we will then have a definitive view on the constitutional position regarding the proper protection of judges from an overbearing Government seeking to interfere in judicial functions. It is possible to have judges take the same general terms and conditions which apply to other workers, such as income tax and capital tax. They are not treated as special individuals rather, they are treated the same as the general body of citizens. The Government has run away from this issue. If it is put into law judges can, if they so wish, contest it. If such a contest leads to a ruling in favour of the Judiciary, we will need to amend the Constitution. However, that is not necessary. It was cowardice on the part of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, that he refused to allow an opt-in measure for judges in this Bill that would allow them to demonstrate what is true regarding a majority of them, namely, that they are prepared to share the same burden imposed by this Bill on their fellow citizens employed in the public service.",Lenihan

"I wish to share time with Deputy Clune. I welcome the chance to speak on this important matter that has implications for every man, woman and child in this country. Few citizens have not been adversely affected by crime in the past decade and by the scandalous inability of the Fianna Fáil Government to tackle the changing face of criminal activity, which seems to indicate that life is cheap given the large number of gun-related crimes over the past two to three years. Gun crime, killing motivated by greed and revenge, much of which is drug related, has reached epidemic proportions and is a massive indictment of this Government. After ten years in Government and over ten years after the horrific murder of Ms Veronica Guerin, Fianna Fáil has done nothing to tackle the rise in gangland crime. Decent people are robbed and assaulted in their homes and communities are ravaged by the scourge of drug-related and other crime. Ordinary people feel the justice system is tilted in favour of criminals rather than unfortunate victims and are all too conscious that many sentences handed down for serious crime are an insult to the concept of justice. I was surprised the previous speaker referred to this, given that he comes from the Government side of the House. Prisons are operating a swinging door policy and the punishment is definitely not fitting the crime. With regard to criminal activity at local level, I wish to highlight in particular the position in my area of Longford-Westmeath and the midlands, an area with which the Minister is familiar and where he has his roots, where the supposed rural pace of life is being threatened and its peace and tranquility are being overturned by excess and threats of violence and intimidation. Overall, the number of headline offences in the midlands between the end of the second quarter of 2006 and the end of the second quarter of 2007 has increased by 1. 5%. While the number of offences across the State has decreased by 1. 1%, a small percentage over the same period, according to the Central Statistics Office in its most recent report, analyses show that between the end of the second quarter of 2006 and the end of the second quarter of 2007 the number of headline offences in the midlands increased by 44, representing a rise of 1. 5%. Over the same period the number of such offences across the State decreased by approximately 1,000, from 104,682 at the end of the [1463]second quarter of 2006 to 103,682 at the end of the second quarter of 2007. This is not a cause for Government self-congratulation, but is caused by people who have lost confidence in the justice system not reporting crimes. I know of several persons who have not reported crimes because they stated that nothing will happen and one will only get the sympathy of the Garda Síochána on the issue. According to the Central Statistic Office, headline crime statistics are interpreted as referring to serious crime incidence but while considered to be the most serious, they do not represent all crime figures. The fear of crime is greater in the midlands compared to the average levels for the State. Indeed, the findings highlighted that the perceptions of crime are higher than the national average in four out of five key indicators. The level of crime in Longford-Westmeath over the past year has frequently grabbed headlines in the national press. There were four raids in Longford last year. There were also a similar number of raids in County Westmeath over the same period. The recent dreadful murder of a young mother in Longford town shocked the county and the entire country. One of the saddest cases I heard in the past year was that of two elderly sisters who reported a break-in at 7 p. m. one evening and had to wait until 11 a. m. the following morning for the gardaí to arrive on the scene. To answer the crime rate in the midlands the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Government need to honour their promise to provide 2,000 extra gardaí. The Minister needs to achieve a visible Garda presence on our streets and to equip the Garda properly. The criminals are better equipped than the Garda Síochána and it is sad to have to say so. The trouble with the law these days is that criminals know their rights better than their wrongs. Perhaps the trouble with this Government is that inaction encourages them in their misapprehension, but therein lies the rub. A government teaches the people by example. If by chance the Government becomes the law breaker, it breeds contempt for law and invites every man and woman to become a law unto themselves which invites anarchy. My party is the one with the record of standing for law and order and I wish the Minister would adopt the policy of former Ministers from this side of the House, former Deputy Paddy Cooney from my constituency and former Deputy Nora Owen, and indeed of my party’s spokesperson who made a fine speech here today, Deputy Charles Flanagan.",Lenihan
"I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate. I firmly believe that during the past few days in particular there were a great many [404]untruths and misinformation in regard to this measure have been put into the public domain. As Deputy Power said, this is about trying to regain competitiveness in our country so as to bring about opportunities in employment. Some of the campaigns on this issue, in particular those run by SIPTU and the bearded ones run by ICTU, have sought to tell people currently in receipt of the minimum wage that their salaries will decrease, which is not true and everyone knows that. I heard many contributions in that regard last week. It behoves all of us in the House to be at the very least straight with people in regard to the situation. When I left school in the early 1990s I was unemployed for a period. I know what it is like to be unemployed. Who knows what will happen after the next election. I know from talking to people in my constituency and beyond that what we must do is create opportunities for people to get back into the workforce. Opportunities have to be created for people to get back into the workforce. Thankfully, over the past three months, we have witnessed a significant drop in unemployment month on month. There are reasons for that, including emigration, unfortunately, but new jobs have been also created. In north Dublin, more than 3,500 new jobs were created this year. We have rightly had many debates on support for the indigenous SME sector, the cost of business, local authority rates and so on. Local authorities have an important role in this regard. Fingal County Council reduced the rate multiplier by 10% last year, yet this was opposed by Fine Gael. The reduction passed by only one vote, 12 to 11, at the time. Many of the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil councillors supported it and it has made a significant difference. We have debated reducing the cost of energy but we have to get real and discuss the cost of employing people as well. Many forms of assistance are provided with more than 100,000 on the employment subsidy scheme, which involves the Government directly supporting jobs. The cost of living now is the same as in April 2007, according to the ESRI and independent observers, not the Government. The minimum wage is still the third highest in Europe and it has been increased by 55% since it was introduced, while inflation increased by 28% during the same period. These are cold hard facts, yet some Members say that people’s salaries will be cut and the reduction in the minimum wage will be a disincentive to work. The wage for a 40-hour week based on the new minimum wage rate will be €306 compared to a social welfare payment of €188 per week. We must be aware of the social welfare trap in this regard. The measure will generate nothing for the Exchequer and it is not about the Government trying to make more money. We are trying to make sure we support the businesses employing people in every town and village. We had debates about the restaurant sector and the Sunday premium rates, which have to be changed. This provision is killing businesses, particularly in rural Ireland and rural parts of my constituency. We must address these realities. Regardless of the composition of the next Government, if my colleagues in the Labour Party are in government, they will not reverse the decision because it would be seen as anti-employment, which it would be because it would mean an increase in costs for employers. The intention is to get people back to work and this measure has been portrayed negatively in the media and political circles. I received text messages from SIPTU, which ran a round robin campaign on this saying we were robbing from the working poor. This change does not affect existing contracts. If anyone in the public gallery wants to discuss this, he or she should put his or her name on the ballot paper and run for election and we can debate it in the Chamber. That is a fact, whether anyone likes it or not. Approximately 1. 8 million people are at work. Too many people have lost their jobs in the past two and a half years. It behoves all of us and any future Government, whatever its composition, to provide opportunities to get people back to work. Whether we like it or not, one of the issues is wage costs.",Power
"Unlike Deputy Power I am a voluntary stray. Deputy Power has been compulsorily strayed. This Government is attempting to pass a social welfare Bill to take money from the blind and those providing care in the home for sick members of their family rather than having them in institutional care at greater cost to the State. The Bill also takes money from widows and from people paid less than €600 per week, while top bankers on €500,000 a year are not touched. The Government is doing this in a way that treats the Dáil with contempt. It also did so yesterday. It is questionable whether the social welfare Bill is properly before the House. Yesterday, my colleague Deputy Shortall opposed the order proposed by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The Ceann Comhairle called a vote on it, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs overruled the Ceann Comhairle and no vote was taken on it. This raises the question of whether the social welfare Bill is properly before the House. Politically, the Government is attempting to get Deputies Healy-Rae, Lowry, Grealish, McDaid and the two strays from Sligo to vote to cut money from people who are blind, those providing care, the widowed and those in bad circumstances before Members get back to their constituents. This is a political order to get the social welfare Bill through before Deputies are exposed to constituents discussing it with them. The Labour Party will not agree to this order. This is the height of arrogance and it adds insult to the injury inflicted on these people last Wednesday.",Power
"I compliment Deputy Brian Hayes on tabling this motion and on his efforts in bringing this Government to account for the dreadful way it is treating the weakest members of our society, particularly children with autism. The last time we debated this issue I expressed my concerns on what is happening in the midlands and today we debate the tragedy of what is happening between several Departments and the courts where parents, who give so much of their time to improving the lot of their children, have to go to court to fight for their children’s rights. Despite what has happened it is important we keep the pressure on the Government to improve services for those with autism. Everyone on this side of the House feels this arrogant Government has let down the nation on services and facilities to help families who have a child suffering from autism. It is important the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children put proper facilities in place. It is unfortunate that parents have to take cases to court, protest outside this House and lose their homes to keep simple respite services and demand the help they need. Several reports have been published containing many recommendations, but few of these recommendations that would improve provisions for children with autism and their parents have been implemented. Under the Minister’s watch there have been great weaknesses in the delivery of special education services. There are limited ABA centres throughout the country [113]and it is the Minister’s policy to restrict the funding available for these centres despite demands for this type of tuition. Parents are frustrated continually by the service delays in assessment of autistic children, which further restrict such children from progressing. There are significant waiting lists for occupational, speech and language therapy and there is little co-ordination between the Minister’s Department and the Department of Health and Children in providing such services. It is evident from recent statements from the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, and the Taoiseach that neither has a full understanding of the debate. Their attitudes, inaccuracies and mistakes are outrageous. If such ignorance of the issue is displayed by them it raises the suspicion that most Members of this woefully corrupt dictatorship are equally misinformed, including the withering Greens. Parents must be provided with suitable services and choices for their children. We regret the manner in which the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has bullied parents and children with autism. There is no system of appeal for parents other than seeking their children’s rights to educational services through the courts, as the recent case proved. The Minister prefers dragging parents through the courts to providing the necessary services. It is interesting to note that the author of a Government task force report on autism described the Government’s policy on autism as grossly misguided and out of touch with reality. This is a dreadful indictment of this Government. I plead with the Government at this late stage to abandon the dreadful cold heart of stone of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, and show some solidarity with parents and children with autism. Nothing is permanent but change and I urge the Minister to show respect and a thought for children with autism by supporting the Fine Gael motion so that we might all begin to improve the lives of all children suffering from autism.",Hayes
"I will accept the Ceann Comhairle’s word. The Minister appears to have grasped the import of what I was suggesting in my amendment and I hope he will confirm that in his reply. Agreements for leases are, in effect, leases and it may be unduly harsh on those who have already concluded agreements but not yet leases. I would welcome confirmation of that point from the Minister and would be reasonably happy if it was indeed the case. I wish to refer to the points raised by Deputy Tuffy regarding difficulties for drafters of leases in multi-unit developments, of which there are many. The provision for rent review is almost always made by reference to the consumer price index or a fixed increase. I ask the Minister what device he intends to use in dealing with such leases. I am concerned that it may not be possible for parties to contract out of this section. Even if both parties to an agreement desire an alternative arrangement to suit their business needs, they cannot now give legal effect to it. I have some sympathy with the points raised by Deputy Ciarán Lynch in this regard but I am not sure if that is sufficient in circumstances where parties have entered into agreements for leases with the benefit of expert advice. I do not know of anybody who would engage in the drafting or conclusion of an agreement for lease, particularly one involving high street retail outlets, without the benefit of legal, accounting and tax advice. If these agreements may be set aside under law, the advice received and the commitments entered into would be left in a precarious position. The Minister may have received correspondence from the Irish Association of Investment Managers regarding unintended consequences for landlords, tenants and the property market in general. As he will be aware, investment managers invest in property on behalf of pension funds. Has he taken advice on the consequences of the change on the valuation of investment properties? The valuation of property assets is dependent on the multiplier assigned to a particular income stream and a lower multiplier is used in the event of uncertainty. It may have the effect of further increasing pension fund deficits. As my colleague, Deputy Barrett, noted earlier, this is important in the context of NAMA because that agency’s ultimate cost to the taxpayer will depend on its ability to generate a profit through the eventual sale of its assets. I am mindful of Deputy Barrett’s advice because the ultimate sale of the asset may well realise an amount which is significantly smaller than envisaged. It is unknown territory as to what might happen in terms of valuation. I seek the Minister’s reassurance that this new proposal will not have the effect of reducing the value of properties even further and will not have an unintended increase for the taxpayer, which may well be a consequence of NAMA. In addition to the reduction in the value of assets, it may be more difficult for NAMA to find purchasers for the properties. That point was also referred to by Deputy Barrett. There are large unfinished estates, apartment blocks and commercial developments in every constituency in the country, including my own, which will become health and safety hazards. I can foresee a situation where, under health and safety regulations, NAMA will have to engage demolition contractors to remove such developments. It could well be, therefore, that upwards-only rent reviews will reduce the risk of defaulters on bank loans by property investors as there is no risk that the income stream may fall at rent review and be insufficient to meet mortgage repayments. With no certainty on the future minimum income stream, banks will be less likely to purchase the NAMA assets. An unintended consequence of the Minister’s proposal may be the discouragement of foreign investment in the Irish property market as income streams will be less secure than in the United Kingdom, for example. I trust the Minister has taken these issues into consideration. Going back to the initial point raised by Deputy Ciarán Lynch, it may have been wiser to have a stand-alone piece of legislation, rather than attaching this at the 11th hour [763]to a Bill that has been knocking around for many years. It was a surprise to see the new-found speed with which the Minister wishes to have this legislation enacted. I am conscious of the Minister’s earlier point about mortgages and repossessions. However, if there was a doubt, and there may well be a doubt, as to the unintended consequences of the Minister’s action, it could have been better to leave the matter to a stand-alone Bill of a type produced by the Labour Party, although I cannot say that Bill was perfect. No doubt Deputy Ciarán Lynch would not say it is perfect either, but if it were examined by the Minister’s experts and those of the Attorney General, they may well come up with a Bill to meet people’s concerns. Professionally advised tenants may feel they wish to set aside the lease but may not have an opportunity to do so under the Minister’s unduly restrictive measure. With regard to the retrospection sought by Deputy Ciarán Lynch, the Minister should give the House the benefit of his best advice in that regard. I accept that there is an obligation on a tenant to pay the rent as agreed. The implied obligation of a tenant to pay rent goes back to section 42 of Deasy’s Act of 1860. That obligation will always be expressly stated in the lease in any event. I refer the Minister to the case of Charlton v . Kidney and McNamee involving a special summons application for the appointment of a rent review arbitrator. In that case the Master of the High Court expressed the view that upwards-only rent reviews might be invalid in the current financial climate. In the High Court, Judge Laffoy took a completely different view when the final hearing of the case took place. She expressed the view that a tenant who has signed up to an upwards-only rent review clause was bound by it. That can only be changed by legislation, which is what the Minister is doing, but it will only refer to leases or agreements that will be entered into following the passing of the legislation. To go back to my earlier point, I do not have to withdraw my amendments at this stage. I look forward to receiving the Ceann Comhairle’s letter, which I hope will meet the concerns I have raised.",Lynch

"The Casino Regulation Committee, established in 2006 by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in undertaking its work examined the issue of gambling. As the Deputy will be aware, in my previous capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I informed the House on 17 April that the whole issue of regulating gaming in Ireland was best addressed through the publication of the Casino Regulation Committee’s report Regulating Gaming in Ireland and by referring it to an informal All-Party Committee for consideration. While the report deals primarily with the regulation of gaming in Ireland, it is clear that the complex issues involved have implications for other areas of gambling including sports betting. Therefore, the issue of legislative reform for gambling as a whole should not arise until the complexities of the report have been considered fully. Responsibility for considering the Casino Regulation Committee’s report now rests with my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, TD. Minister Ahern, on 28 May, informed the House that while he had not yet had the opportunity to consider how to best advance the complex issues involved, he intended to move quickly and [291]that he was conscious of the need to ensure that the widest possible range of views was canvassed and brought to bear on settling public policy in this area. I support Minister Ahern’s approach.",Ahern
"In reply to Deputy Tuffy, in December I made €16. 488,257 million available to 16 city and county councils and three town councils to assist them with the unexpected expenditure involved in responding rapidly to the flooding in their areas. Deputy Lynch inquired about risk assessment and how we will use the information. We must use the information to ensure that in those areas which have now been shown to be vulnerable, for example, the quays in Cork, that we put in place proper flood protection. We have increased spending on that provision. It is the OPW which is examining the matter of risk assessment in detail. In reply to Deputy Durkan, the preliminary estimate would indicate that the total cost of the damage could be approximately €100 million. Most of the expenditure is associated with repairs to national and non-national roads and bridges and quay walls in Cork and Limerick. Other areas of expenditure are connected to water supplies, housing and the general costs of the clean-up. I understand that the Department of Finance will shortly decide on whether it is possible to submit an application for assistance under the European Union’s solidarity fund. The threshold of overall expenditure before any assistance would be payable is high at more than €973 million. I am trying to estimate what will be the total cost. I understand that the insurance industry has estimated that the total cost could be approximately €250 million. I do not have the cost for agriculture or other areas. We are trying to quantify the expenditure. It is clear from all of those figures that this is something that can cause major damage and personal hardship. I am aware of that. When one considers the cost associated with flooding, this is why investment in prevention is such a good investment.",Lynch

"I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate introduced by my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on behalf of the Labour Party. The motion is probably the most comprehensive one on reform of our institutions and of the way we do our business in the Dáil that has ever been put before the House. This is why it is so dispiriting to hear the Minister of State sum up for the Government. It seems the Minister of State and the Fianna Fáil speakers almost invariably were of the opinion that this is another routine motion about reform of the Dáil. It is not about that at all. This is a fundamentally transformative resolution that seeks to start by acknowledging that politics is in crisis in this country. It does not matter whether the Government is of the opinion, as it is, that we are being unfairly treated, that many of the criticisms are ill-founded or that some of them are destructive. Closing our eyes to the reality will not make that go away. This is not just a motion about Dáil reform. It seeks to chart a roadmap for reform that will restore confidence in politics, in this House and in our capacity as a country to lead the way to economic recovery. It was Deputy Seán Power who said in the debate that we have a duty to lift the spirit of the country and to give honest leadership. I agree with that, and I agree with the way he approached the motion. That is what motivated it. The problem is that hot on the heels of the collapse of our economy is the near collapse of confidence in politics and in this House. I do not know how it is but, somehow, the comprehensive failure of Fianna Fáil is coming to be represented as the failure of the political system. The underlying assumption that is allowed to take hold is that because Fianna Fáil has failed so comprehensively, it automatically follows that no other party and no other combination of parties in this House is capable of prudently managing our affairs. It is almost as if the dyed-in-the-wool Fianna Fáil loyalists and their fellow travellers have concluded it is somehow best to salvage something of the reputation of the once-great party by spreading the word that 'because we failed to do it, we are telling you the others will do no better'. It is a new version of the old story when Fianna Fáil is in trouble, 'sure, you are all the same'. [615]There is absolutely no evidence that our political system, for all its faults, and it has serious faults, is incapable of throwing up a competent Government that can restore confidence and lead us to economic recovery. We have now reached such a crisis that nobody in this country, whatever one’s political loyalties, has a vested interest in creating such a new conventional wisdom. News travels fast nowadays, and our country’s reputation has taken a severe pounding in recent times. Promulgating the notion that we cannot govern ourselves is another nail in the reputation of our country, and it is not true. The Labour Party motion moved by Deputy Howlin is intended to restore confidence in politics. Our key institutions must be made fit for purpose. This House must demonstrate there is a better way to do our business. Parliament must demonstrate it can lead an independent existence and has a purpose and role which are separate to the Government. Traditional public service work practices must be overhauled. The relationship between Ministers and their Secretaries General must be brought into the 21st century. We need to redefine the relationship between Ministers and their Departments and between a Minister and his or her Secretary General. Nineteenth century notions of personal ministerial responsibility coupled with legal ministerial responsibility for all official departmental acts and the legal competence of civil servants to perform such acts without any necessary recourse to the Minister lead to a situation where accountability to the Oireachtas is demanded on an entirely fictitious basis. It is absurd to claim that a Minister is personally responsible for every action in his or her Department and it is a dereliction of accountability on the part of this House to excuse a Minister because he or she did not know something in his Department that he or she should have known. It is not acceptable that a Minister might fail to intervene when he or she should have done so or neglect to stay informed of potential, as well as actual, problems. Our system suits weak Ministers and traditional civil servants. When cock-ups occur, they circle the wagons and engage in collective self-defence. The Minister’s impenetrable corporate shroud protects the civil servant and Minister alike from individual examination and accountability. This system breeds the kind of Minister who sees himself or herself as an ambassador-at-large who photographs well but does not read a brief. There is a world of difference between being an ambassador plenipotentiary and being a Minister who wields executive power. Accountability must be at the heart of the reforms we seek to make. The Dáil is not working as well as it might. The Government is running the country in an unaccountable manner and it is riding roughshod over this House. The filleting of the Freedom of Information Act, the constraining of the Equality Authority, the abolition of the Combat Poverty Agency, the shooting down of the Labour Party Private Members’ Bill on protecting whistleblowers and the rejection of regulations on lobbyists all point in the direction of a Government which is opposed to subjecting its actions to scrutiny. The result of unaccountable Government is unimaginable failure. 'Consensus' was a word that was unheard of when Fianna Fáil was riding high on the hog. This House should be aware that consensus does not mean cover up and collusion. This motion is a comprehensive roadmap for reforming our institutions, establishing real accountability and restoring confidence in the capacity of politics to provide solutions and lead recovery. One of the principal reasons for the collapse of confidence both inside and outside of this jurisdiction is the fact that our dysfunctional Government is on a life-support machine. It is guilty of dereliction of duty on a scale never before experienced in this State. As long as the same people remain in office we will not be able to restore our reputation. When the people eventually get the opportunity to speak, the alternative Government must have ready for implementation a programme of reform that puts beyond doubt our determination to change the way we govern. [616]Fianna Fáil’s response is to circle the wagons and close its ears to the daily denigration of politics. Even if some of the commentary is ill founded or even destructive, ignoring it is the wrong response. The way we do politics must change. We have many natural advantages, the talents of our people are capable of digging us out of this hole and we have shown that we can earn our way in the world. Our people demand leadership and they deserve no less. I was profoundly disturbed to learn that the European Court of Auditors has found that we did need to close Mallow sugar factory. I had an opportunity to visit Mallow sugar factory along with Deputy Sherlock, who was then a councillor, and listen to a presentation on the closure of Carlow sugar factory and the transfer of its machinery to Mallow. The people who made the presentation believed they could grow jobs at Mallow and argued there was no difficulty in transporting beet. They were adamant that Ireland ought to retain its sugar industry. This is a classic example of a Government which was not prepared to hear what this side of the House had to say, even while jobs were piling up in the construction sector and our manufacturing base was being eroded. It was a chronic failure that the jobs in Mallow were allowed to go without a fight for the people who worked at the plant and the growers who supplied it. Mallow is only one of many decisions, however. The biggest decisions, which relate to the banks, were addressed by my colleagues. This Government in its previous guises killed off the notion of inquiry by parliamentary committee. In the US, a congressional inquiry into the reasons for the banking failure in that country was established within days. After Abbeylara, the Government contrived to kill off inquiry by committee, despite the success of the DIRT inquiry in retrieving €1 billion for the Exchequer and making recommendations that produced our modern and efficient Revenue Commissioners. Neither senior public servants nor the Government wanted to allow inquiries by parliamentary committee. Banking inquiries, which were conducted in the US and the United Kingdom, were obstructed here. A secret investigation was commenced behind closed doors. Perhaps it was his messianic zeal to become more Fianna Fáil then Fianna Fáil itself that caused the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to claim that investigation would be open but if anybody in this House has come across this open inquiry, I ask him or her to tell us. Huge questions remain unanswered, such as who advised the blanket guarantee which directly resulted in bond spreads climbing towards 9%. Merrill Lynch did not advise such a guarantee and the Department of Finance claims it did not do so either. It is one of the great questions of our time, alongside the meaning of life and whether there is a God. Deputy Thomas Byrne claimed that attempts to extend the Freedom of Information Act to the Garda Síochána were typical of the approach of the left and he asked how could anybody consider extending it. Clearly he did not hear last night’s contribution by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who stated that the Government intends to extend the Act to the administrative functions of the Garda. I welcome that. Deputy Thomas Byrne does not think it is a good idea, however, despite the arguments that have been frequently adduced in this House suggesting that it could be very good for the force itself, as well as for society. The Deputy either thinks a few votes might matter in Meath East at the next election — I doubt he is right about that — or he is trying to blacken the name of this party, in terms of our wish to implement the same reforms throughout the entire public service, including in the Garda Síochána. I thought his remarks were unworthy of him. I do not know how many Members of this House are aware of the existence of the post of confidential recipient. I should mention, in case the Acting Chairman might ever need the services of the recipient, that the role of the official in question involves hearing complaints from members of the Garda about matters that cause them to be disturbed about the discharge [617]of the functions of the Garda Síochána. When I tried to establish what this chap does and where he is based, I was told after a long search that it was confidential. When I telephoned the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the official to whom I spoke expressed the belief that the confidential recipient had an office in the Department. When I rang back a few days later to talk to the recipient, the people to whom I spoke said they had never heard of him. When I cornered the Minister, who is usually full of information and anxious to share it with the Opposition, he confirmed that the confidential recipient is indeed based in the Department of Justice and Law Reform. Does he expect ordinary gardaí from around the country to present themselves in the Department to make their complaints about what is going on in the force? If so, it sums up the Government’s attitude to secrecy and the way decisions should be made in government. That is a big part of the reason we are where we are tonight. Amendment put.

"I propose all city and county development boards should be constituted as employment taskforces for the duration of this economic crisis. The reason for my proposal is that the response to the recent job losses, for example, at Dell in Limerick was to establish an employment taskforce. When Deputy Rabbitte was a Minister of State, he established job taskforces in response to job losses in Tallaght and other places. Rather than waiting to establish a jobs taskforce in response to company closures, it might be a better approach to have the taskforce already established. The make-up of an employment taskforce is the same as city and country development boards with all the agencies involved being on both. These boards would be ideally placed, meaning new organisations would not have to be set up. The South County Dublin Development Board has already set itself up as an employment support forum. This is the model for other boards across the country. The job losses in south County Dublin, the local authority area in which I reside and represent, are the equivalent of several Dell closures. This is being mirrored in many parts of the country. Jobs lost here and there add up to sizeable numbers. There is, however, not the same response if it were one single factory closure. The county development boards would be able to ensure every responsible organisation with which they engage, such as the county councils, the VECs, FÁS, the IDA and the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Education and Science, would come up with proposals and initiatives to support local job creation and jobseekers. A board could ask, for example, what its county council could do to support existing businesses, to maintain existing jobs and to expand the workforce. The local FÁS office could examine what it could do to provide opportunities for jobseekers through training, education and employment schemes. Other organisations could examine the local demographic profiles and match them with the type of jobs we need to create for the future, particularly in sustainable and environmentally clean alternative energy. [811]An OECD report suggested community employment schemes should not be expanded but alternative schemes examined. I would, however, expand the existing community employment schemes. In 1995, more than 40,000 places were available on community employment schemes while now there are only 20,000 places. Unemployment has returned as a major problem, with graduates, construction workers and those who worked in manufacturing joining the dole queues. When I left college, I worked on what was then called a social employment scheme in the administration and clerical areas. Eventually, I obtained a permanent job, trained further and became a solicitor. We need to provide similar opportunities for people who are graduating now, otherwise they will be obliged to emigrate or go on the dole. I do not necessarily believe that people on community employment schemes would be paid more than they would obtain in the form of jobseeker’s benefit or allowance. However, they would at least be able to go to work. People want to develop their CVs, obtain work experience and learn new skills. It is important that a higher level of training be provided on such schemes than has been the case in the past. An article in today’s edition of The Irish Times states that a report compiled in England shows that college is the healthiest option for school leavers during times of recession. In other words, it is much better for them to attend college rather than go on the dole. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, recently made the point that the abolition of third level fees did nothing to improve access to college. The opposite is the case. HEA reports show that, since the Labour Party abolished fees in 1998, participation rates in third level education have improved among the members of every socioeconomic group. The Government should give consideration to the serious damage it will do if it reintroduces third level fees. School leavers will be discouraged from attending college and will end up on the dole. As already stated, it is much better for people to be in employment — which would be ideal — attending college or on a community employment scheme.",O'Keeffe
"I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to tonight’s debate on the legislation proposed by my constituency colleague, Deputy Charles Flanagan, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Protection of Debtors) Bill 2009. It is a very timely and important Bill covering an issue very much in people’s minds and it affects people’s daily lives. While a thorough debate is needed on these issues, the Bill before us is not the way to proceed. It is well intentioned but would be difficult to implement in practice. The Bill proposes a licensing arrangement for the recovery of consumer and commercial debt and would provide for the establishment of a debt collection regulator. This is an attempt to establish yet another State body or quango. I dare say if this side of the House proposed a debt collection regulator, several Members on the Opposition’s front bench would be jumping up and down both in this Chamber and on television before the night was out to accuse us of establishing another quango. That sort of inconsistency is displayed by the Deputies opposite every second week when they propose further quangos despite repeated calls for their abolition.",Flanagan
"I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House this morning on the final phase measures that the Government is taking to restore stability and certainty to Ireland’s banking system. The banking measures announced by the Minister for Finance on Tuesday are the last in a series of successful measures taken to stabilise the banks, to protect the interests of the taxpayer and depositors and to put the economy in a position to benefit from the global economic recovery that is getting under way. The decisive measures taken by the Government over the past 18 months mean that our international reputation is credible. Our efforts to restore stability have been positively received [206]throughout Europe and around the world and we are now in a position to return to sustainable economic growth. With these latest initiatives, the Government has tackled the problems presented by the banking crisis head on. These measures will ensure that our banking system plays an important role in Ireland’s recovery. There is no doubt that many of the decisions taken have been unpleasant, and are unpopular, but they will put us in a position to enjoy long-term stability. In the Dáil on Tuesday night, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated that the initiatives he had announced provided a solid basis for fostering confidence in the future of our financial system. Despite the predictable negative response from the usual quarters, the wider international reaction has shown that the Minister was correct. In the international media, even the Financial Times, an organ that is never slow to criticise the policies of governments, has been most positive and commented that Ireland is managing the downturn well and beginning to claw back competitiveness. It went on to comment: Taken together, and with the right policy tweaks, this could offer Ireland a route back to the authentically tigerish 1990s rather than the long recession of the 1980s. Reports from our embassies also indicate positive international reactions. For example, in Germany there is praise that the Government is tackling the problems head on, and media articles note that the financial markets have responded positively and point to the reduced costs of Irish Government bonds compared to equivalent Greek bonds. In the Seanad yesterday, Senator Fiona O’Malley correctly referred to the problems that negative domestic publicity can create with regard to attracting — and, indeed, retaining — foreign direct investment. Therefore, positive, independent, international reactions to our banking and economic policies are particularly welcome in this context. With regard to sovereign borrowing, the fact is that our spreads have been falling in response to positive views concerning our progress in grappling with our wide ranging problems. The international reaction to our policy mix is, therefore, positive but that is a message not a target. The key target is to deal with our domestic problems in such a way as to provide the most secure future for or people. We are all rightly concerned about the burden of the banks’ recapitalisation on our citizens, but pretending that there are easier solutions does not ease the burden. The Minister’s statement on banking represents a clear recognition of the problems that exist and it shows that this Government is determined to tackle the problems head on in order to ensure we get out of this crisis as quickly as possible. I now want to deal specifically with NAMA. The House is aware that the first loans have transferred to the agency. NAMA must ensure the best possible return for the taxpayer and this is why it has taken such a careful approach to the valuation of the loans. The first tranche represents approximately 20% of the total amount to be transferred and comes from the ten largest borrowers. The banks will incur heavy losses on the loans which NAMA will acquire from them. This is as it should be and it is clear that NAMA is no bail out for the banks, nor indeed for the developers, who are still required to pay back their loans in full. The crystallisation of the loans has made the future of each of the institutions clearer and has forced them to deal with the resultant losses now. The recapitalisation implications of these losses for each institution have been dealt with in detail over the past few days and I do not wish to restate them now. There is no doubt that recapitalisation requires substantial investment by the State in the banks, although payments will be structured in a way that eases the burden on taxpayers. These actions are being taken for a good reason, so that the banking system may return to its rightful role as provider of credit to the real economy. No other course of action would result in a swift return by the [207]banking sector to its function as a provider of finance. By forcing the banks to recognise their losses upfront, we can rid the system of these speculative loans and end the mismanagement of the banking system. The suggestion remains that the nationalisation option would have been less costly. The argument seems to be that if only we nationalised AIB and Bank of Ireland it would have eliminated the valuation risk around NAMA, and as a result there would have been no need for the concept of long-term economic value. As the Minister announced on Tuesday, if the Government had opted to do this, the losses crystallised at the two main banks would still have had to be fully recognised, and real capital would still have been required. As the full owner of these institutions, the State would have had to cover the totality of this enlarged capital requirement, with no prospect of new private sector funds contributing. All in all, I firmly believe that the option chosen by the Government is the most beneficial to the taxpayer. The subject of benefits leads me to the proposals for credit and lending. Recapitalisation of the banks is not for the benefit of the banks but rather for the benefit of the Irish economy. The primary function of the banking system must be providing credit to the real economy. Well-capitalised banks are in a much better position to lend. In this regard, the lending targets outlined by the Minister for lending to small and medium enterprises this year and next will play their part. Furthermore, the banks will be required to realign their business practices with the needs of the modern Irish economy. Properly targeted lending to SMEs provides growth and employment. The Minister stressed on Tuesday that working capital for businesses is essential. Entrepreneurs must be facilitated and given the scope to expand and develop. The target set, of €3 billion each in new lending in 2010 and 2011 from Bank of Ireland and AIB will see this objective met. To ensure the proper management of these funds the two banks will be required to submit SME lending plans both by geography and sector for 2010 and 2011. In addition to this and in recognition of the essential role played by small and medium enterprises in our economy, today marks the launch of the credit review office, which will provide a simple, effective review process for SMEs, including sole traders and agricultural enterprises, who have had requests for credit refused or reduced, or indeed who have had credit withdrawn. The outcome for the review process for the borrower will be an independent and impartial opinion on the credit decision. Banks will be required to comply with recommendations from the credit review office or to explain why they will not do so. Mr. John Trethowan will head the office, with administrative assistance from Enterprise Ireland. Mr. Trethowan will also be reviewing bank lending policies and the banks’ SME lending plans as part of his remit. If the Minister deems that further action is required on the part of the banks, he and the Government will not be slow to act. There is no question but that there are large costs to resolving Ireland’s banking crisis. However, Ireland enjoys the confidence of the international markets because of the determined and successful steps the Government has taken to place our public finances and our banking sector on a more sustainable footing. It is clear that facing up to the problems presented by the severe downturn in our fiscal position has paid off. The actions announced on Tuesday will have the same affect on our financial sector by compelling the banks to face up to their difficulties too. The banks have been forced to recognise their losses and this Government, on behalf of the taxpayer, has committed the capital that will ensure we have a banking system to serve this economy as it recovers. The closely co-ordinated approach to the policy initiatives on banking is a clear indication of the determination of the Government and of all the State agencies concerned to work in a co-ordinated manner to secure the future of the financial system and to build for the future. It has drawn a line under the inadequate oversight of the past and is a clear indication that only [208]the highest standards will be tolerated in our financial services sector into the future. At the risk of repeating what the Taoiseach and the Minister have already said, the certainty provided by these latest announcements will further boost international confidence in this country and they will smooth Ireland’s path to economic recovery.",Lenihan
"I move: 'That the Bill be now read a Second Time.' This Bill, entitled the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 provides, as indicated in the Long Title, for amendment of existing legislation on civil legal aid, civil liability, private security services, intoxicating liquor, equality, bankruptcy, maintenance of spouses and children, solicitors, conveyancing, statutory declarations and domestic violence. While many of the provisions in this type of Bill are technical only, there are important changes that will strengthen the law and make it more efficient and effective. The explanatory memorandum provided with the Bill on publication is detailed and will be of assistance to those Deputies wishing to familiarise themselves with the various provisions of the Bill that form, in total, as many as nine Parts. 1 o’clock I propose to comment on what might be regarded as the more important features of the Bill. I say that with some hesitation because the Bill is a response to a large number of inputs from a wide range of particular interests who have recommended or sought changes in the law. To mention just a few, it has involved the Legal Aid Board, the Courts Service, the Private Security Authority, the anti-human trafficking unit of my Department, the Law Reform Commission and other Departments. While each of the changes now provided are important in themselves, some changes will have a greater impact than others. What we call the Statute Book will, I think, be generally enhanced by the provisions in the Bill but better still, as I am sure Members will agree, is that the lives of people, the organisation of some agencies and the public interest will be better served. Part 2 of the Bill gives statutory backing to allow the Legal Aid Board to provide legal advice in relation to criminal matters to alleged victims of human trafficking offences in connection with the trafficking or related offences and any related prosecution. The Legal Aid Board will be in a position to provide legal advice to victims of human trafficking all through the criminal justice process to ensure that the victim is fully protected and advised of his or her role as a witness. The amendment will enable full effect to be given the Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings and to a UN protocol on trafficking in persons, in particular women and children. I arranged for the ratification of these instruments this summer, both of which are in operation in the State. The Government takes seriously the crime of human trafficking. The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 criminalises trafficking of persons for sexual or labour exploitation and provides for penalties of up to life imprisonment. The high level interdepartmental group on combating trafficking in human beings and a dedicated anti-human trafficking unit have been established in my Department to co-ordinate a comprehensive, holistic and whole of Government response to the issue of human trafficking. A national action plan to prevent and combat trafficking in human beings was published in June 2009. The plan provides the blueprint for the State’s response to this issue. Once a potential victim comes to the attention of the competent authority, which for cases of human trafficking is the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, they are immediately offered access to a range of services. These include accommodation with the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, medical and support services through a HSE care plan based on their individual needs and legal services provided by the Legal Aid Board. On enforcement, the Garda Síochána has identified trafficking in human beings as one of its priorities in the annual policing plan and has established a human trafficking investigation and co-ordination unit in the Garda National Immigration Bureau. There is a dedicated website —www. blueb[35]lindfold. gov. ie - and a hotline number and an e-mail address to which people can report any suspicions of human trafficking to the Garda Síochána. Part 3 of the Bill is aresponse to those in voluntary groups or organisations who have asked for more clarity in the law in regard to persons who act in good faith as Good Samaritans to provide assistance in the event of an accident or emergency and where persons volunteer to provide care, advice or assistance to others. Voluntary activity is, of course, essential in any society. It is important that the law should, as far as possible, protect those who are committed to making a positive difference in the communities in which they live and work. The new provisions are framed on the basis of recommendations from the Law Reform Commission which was asked by the then Attorney General — the late and very esteemed Rory Brady — to consider the civil liability of those Good Samaritans who intervene to assist and help an injured person. I am glad to be in a position now to implement the recommendations of the commission albeit with some technical and legal changes. The new law will mean that protection is provided from liability for persons involved in voluntary work for charitable or other purposes for the benefit of society, including sports, recreation and rescue. While the Bill sets out an ordinary standard of care for volunteer organisations, provision is also made for account to be taken of the benefit accruing to society as a result of the organisation’s work in determining whether it is just and reasonable to impose liability. To achieve balance in the law, volunteers will be required to act in a way that does not contribute to gross negligence, while the volunteer organisation with whom they operate will be held to the higher standard of ordinary negligence. In this regard, I acknowledge the initiative of Deputies Timmins and Flanagan in sponsoring a Private Members’ Bill on the matter. I think that they will agree that the provisions that I have brought forward will meet in full their concerns in this area. The amendments contained in Part 4 of the Bill, again many of them quite technical in nature, will result in the strengthening of the capacity of the Private Security Authority, PSA, in areas such as licensing and enforcement and will enable it to keep up to date in an evolving industry dealing with ongoing technological advances. The PSA has brought about a significant and welcome transformation of the security industry over the past few years. There are in addition many acknowledged positive benefits for the industry itself, the wider business community and the public alike, including a reduction in the potential for criminal activity. On the basis of experience of operation of the PSA over the past number of years, it has become clear that its effectiveness can be improved by the changes provided for in the Bill. The amendments provide for improvements to the licensing process of the authority, including technical changes to certain aspects of the renewal procedures and the ability to grant a temporary licence in particular circumstances. The expansion of the authority’s powers to request information, in the case of a contractor, from a wider group of individuals than is currently the case will augment further what are already very substantial gains to the State arising from tax certification and other compliance measures brought about through the licensing process. Security services are the subject of change owing to advances in technology and it is important that the legislation underpinning the authority takes this into account. The amendments of the Private Security Services Act provided for in Part 4 of the Bill help to update the Act. They will also facilitate changes in the fee structure of the Private Security Authority. Provision is made to allow the authority to appoint persons, in addition to its own staff, to be an inspector and so give the authority the ability to contract in outside inspectors, if necessary. A useful new provision is that the authority will be in a position to issue a temporary licence to an applicant who is a new entrant to the industry for a period not exceeding six months, during which the applicant can prove he or she has the necessary competence to perform the security services in question. The authority may, in exceptional circumstances, extend the [36]temporary licence for a further three month period, if necessary. I am also making provision to allow the authority to recover, through the fees charged, as much of the expenses incurred in running it as it considers appropriate. Part 5 of the Bill makes provision for statutory backing for codes of conduct in relation to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor. This is an important provision which is designed to encourage voluntary compliance with licensing law provisions by licensees generally, or categories of licensees, and will complement the Garda’s overall enforcement programme. It forms part, therefore, of the Government’s strategy to continue to combat alcohol-related harm in our society. Deputies may recall that during discussions leading up to enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 I was asked by representative bodies in the mixed trading sector to consider the possibility of a voluntary code of practice as an alternative to the statutory provisions requiring structural separation of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets such as supermarkets and convenience stores. I agreed to this subject to agreement on the terms of such a code and independent verification of compliance with it. The code of practice for the mixed trading sector was subsequently agreed and the sector appointed Mr. Pádraic White as chairperson of a new body, Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland, RRAI, to oversee its implementation. He submitted his first compliance report last autumn which showed that considerable progress had been made in the code’s first year of operation. I am expecting submission of the 2010 report shortly. The purpose of section 14 is to give codes of practice, which have been entered into voluntarily by licence holders, quasi-legal status. It provides that while non-compliance with such a code will not be an offence and, therefore, will not attract a fine or other such penalty, non-compliance will constitute a ground upon which an objection to renewal of the licence concerned can be made. This will help to ensure that licensees implement the terms of any codes to which they have signed up and will give the Garda and instrument to promote compliance. This section will permit the drawing up and implementation of voluntary codes to cover areas of licensing law but also areas such as the advertising and marketing of alcohol products and staff training, which are not covered by the licensing code. I want to stress that such codes will not replace but will rather complement statutory provisions. They will not reduce enforcement of the law but rather assist in promoting compliance. Licensees who commit offences under licensing law will continue to be prosecuted by the gardaí in our courts if offences are committed. The Bill, in Part 6, provides for a small number of amendments to the Equality Acts. These amendments are intended to improve the efficiency and user friendliness of the Equality Tribunal in handling complaints and to take into account legal decisions at both national and EU level. I have agreed with my colleague, the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, to incorporate the amendments in this Bill so that the legislative changes can be effected at an early date. The amendments provide that the tribunal may, where appropriate, deal with cases on the basis of written submissions alone state a case to the High Court and avoid further litigation by way of appeal in situations where mediation has failed, the deadline for application for resumption of the hearing is extended and the maximum amount that may be awarded in employment equality cases is increased to two years’ remuneration or €40,000, whichever is greater, to provide for greater redress in situations of low-paid employment. This is designed to align the text of national law more closely with European Union equality directives. The Bill, in Part 7, will provide for certain limited amendments to the current Bankruptcy Act 1988. I have already indicated to the House on a number of occasions that I will give early attention [37]to the final report of the Law Reform Commission on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, which is expected in the near future. Current Irish personal insolvency law, in the opinion of Government and the commission, is in need of comprehensive reform. The Bankruptcy Act 1988 is inappropriate to meet the needs of our modern social and economic conditions. The commission, in its interim report of May 2010, recommended that, as a modest stepping stone towards more comprehensive reform of bankruptcy, the period for application to the court for discharge for bankrupt persons be reduced from 12 years to six years. It has been stated that such a reduction may have limited effect because even after a six year period has expired, further obstacles exist to the debtor’s discharge, that is, payment in full of all expenses, fees and costs of the bankruptcy, as well as all preferential payments — primarily to the Revenue Commissioners — before a discharge can be obtained. As these costs and preferential debts will often amount to very large sums, in the majority of cases a debtor will be unable to meet these amounts at any stage and therefore they may remain bankrupt indefinitely. Nevertheless, the change I am making will assist those who may be in a position to meet their liabilities and, therefore, re-engage in economic activity in society. I am providing, for the first time in Irish law, for the automatic discharge of bankruptcies on the 20th anniversary of the adjudication order in these cases. This will assist in the discharge of long-term bankrupt persons and will allow the official assignee in bankruptcy to put closure in his office on what are called legacy bankruptcies that clog up the bankruptcy system. Part 8 of the Bill addresses difficulties which have arisen consequent on the judgment of the High Court in the McCann case of 2009 concerning the modalities of enforcement of orders for the recovery of civil debt. In that judgment, the High Court found that the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 lacked a number of necessary safeguards in circumstances where a person is at risk of imprisonment. Following this judgment, the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 inserted a series of amendments designed to protect debtors and impose obligations on the creditor. However, this has given rise, unfortunately, to difficulty in some family law cases in regard to the payment of maintenance arrears by spouses on foot of court orders. A number of Deputies on both sides of the House have raised issues in regard to that in recent months. The purpose of the amendment I am now proposing to the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 is to de-couple family law maintenance debt from civil debt in general. The proposed amendment to the law is based on the premise that a court has already deliberated in setting an appropriate level of maintenance and that if the debtor breaches that order without a significant change in his or her circumstances, that breach will constitute contempt of court and can be punished by imprisonment. As these are civil contempt proceedings, both the creditor and debtor will be entitled, subject to the usual criteria, to civil legal aid under the existing provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995. In Part 9 I am amending, among other matters, the Domestic Violence Act 1996 to allow a person to apply for a safety order against a person with whom he or she had a child in common, including where the couple concerned do not live together or have never lived together. The occasion of access to children can be difficult and safety issues can arise. Making safety orders available to the court in such circumstances will provide a remedy for the parties who are in need of protection. Breach of such orders will be an offence under the Act of 1996. I am indebted to the wide range of interests who have helped to inform and shape policy in this area. The citation of the Bill, as a miscellaneous provisions Bill, is one that inevitably suggests it will operate as a magnet for all kinds of reforms and I know there are interests who will want even further changes in the law on this occasion. I am giving consideration to further [38]requests, particularly from the Courts Service, to improve on court procedures to improve access to the courts and make them more efficient. I will, therefore, table amendments at later Stages of the Bill and will seek the co-operation of the House in this exercise. I commend the Bill to the House.",Flanagan
"Deputy Quinn is right. There is no reason for the House to abdicate its role to the Supreme Court in this regard or for the Government to spend more taxpayers’ money defending an issue that does not deserve defending. [389]In the context of extra money being provided by religious organisations towards the overall compensation sum payable by the redress board, the Minister referred to discussions that have been held. The Government is engaging in secret ongoing discussions with the religious congregations which, to date, have failed to give any meaningful commitment to contribute extra money to the redress fund and have only publicly committed themselves to making an unspecified contribution towards some form of trust fund to be established for the benefit of victims of abuse. Fine Gael supports the establishment of the trust fund, but the congregations should contribute 50% of the redress funds being paid out. It is of serious concern and contrary to the public interest that no definitive timeframe has been set for these matters to be resolved. The congregations have given no firm commitment. It is vital that there be published a full credible audit of the property ownerships of the congregations so that the Government and the general public can assess their capacity to make the contribution required to meet their moral obligations to the victims of abuse. The Minister stated that the information produced by the religious orders will be reviewed by three people, but we need to know more than this. Who are the three people, how will they review the information, will the review be published, how will they assess the credibility of the orders’ statements about their property ownerships and will the audit of ownerships extend to extensive properties owned outside the State? All of these matters need greater clarification than we have had to date. I called on the Government to conduct an inquiry into institutions where it was alleged children were the victims of either physical or sexual abuse and that have not been investigated by the Ryan commission. These include St. Laurence’s in Finglas, Trudder House, Trinity House, Scoil Ard Mhuire in Lusk and Madonna House. Former residents of these institutions have the same rights and entitlements as those of institutions investigated by the Ryan commission. These are issues that the Government should address, but is failing to. There is no indication that the Government has learned from the report the essential need for accountability and transparency in our child protection services. Despite previous promises made in the Dáil, portions of the report on the Monageer tragedy published almost two months ago remain censored and seven of its recommendations made to improve child protection and family services remain a mystery. These recommendations have only been read by Ministers and Professor Drumm who, incredibly, cannot communicate the exact recommendations to those involved in the provision of such services. Even more incredibly, Members of Dáil Éireann have no knowledge of the seven recommendations and cannot, therefore, hold the Government or the HSE to account for their implementation. So much for the Government taking the Ryan commission’s message of the need for transparency and accountability. It is widely known that there are three internal HSE reports on the deaths of three children in recent years in the care of health boards or the HSE, namely, Kim Donovan aged 15 years, Tracy Fay aged 18 years and David Foley aged 17 years. The Minister for Health and Children and the HSE continue to suppress these reports and are conducting themselves in a manner only seen in totalitarian dictatorships where governments have no accountability to a properly elected parliament. It is scandalous that, as a Member of the Dáil and Fine Gael’s spokesperson on children, I have found it impossible to gain access to any of the reports detailing what happened to these children for whom the State had responsibility. I have been seeking information from the HSE on 20 children in the care of the State who have lost their lives in the past decade. Four months after raising the issue by way of a Dáil question, all I have managed to learn comes from a report in The Irish Times, which states that the HSE has set up some internal review group to examine what occurred, identify key issues common to the children’s deaths and make recommendations to the HSE’s national director. [390] I understand that, of the 20 deaths, key questions relate to the deaths of 11 children who died as a result of drug overdoses, assaults or suicide. What is now needed is not an internal review group, but an independent inquiry into the deaths of children in care. Have no lessons been learned from the Ryan commission report? Why do the Government, the State and the HSE continue to conduct themselves in the manner of years gone by, which is to suppress information and bring no light to bear on the inadequacies of our child care systems? In no other EU democracy would there be such continuing and obsessive secrecy relating to the deaths of children for whom the state has responsibility, nor would there be a failure of government to account to parliament for what occurred. It is absolutely clear that neither the Government nor the HSE, despite all the verbiage and apologies, has yet truly learned the lessons from the Ryan commission’s report. A radical change of attitude and approach, and new insight, are badly required. In light of the Government’s conduct in recent weeks, Fine Gael is concerned that it will not deal properly with matters arising from the report. We support the principles of the Labour Party’s Bill and believe each issue contained therein deserves to be addressed properly. The Government should support the Bill’s provisions. The Minister spoke tonight about politicising the issue. This is a parliamentary assembly, the purpose of which is to introduce legislation to address injustice and issues that require to be addressed. It is the Government that, this evening, is politicising a Bill that should not be politicised. It is obvious from the Minister’s speech that there is a broad range of issues he agrees need to be examined. He is not rejecting what is proposed in the Bill. Most of the issues derive from the all-party motion passed in this House and all the Bill aims to do is give substantive legislative form to them. If the Government does not want to play politics with this, it should show some decency, humility and insight. Tomorrow evening it should not divide the House but accept the principles of the Bill and allow, in the context of whatever work the Minister, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, are doing, for its consideration on Committee Stage next September. This would allow for the consideration of the conclusions the Government reaches at the end of July. It would also allow for the badly needed reforms, required to benefit the survivors of institutional abuse, to be put on the Statute Book sooner rather than later, that is, by the autumn. Consequently, those who should acquire rights under the legislation will be afforded the opportunity to do so. By agreeing to the Bill, we will not find ourselves in a legislative morass whereby, this time next year, the Government will have failed to publish legislation promised this July, thereby requiring the survivors of institutional abuse to wait for justice yet again.",O'Keeffe
"I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this important Bill. This is an occasion on which I can speak comfortably about Tallaght and my wider constituency because this is where my experience of housing is based. I remind colleagues that I was a member of the local authority from 1991 and I miss it. Much of my work still concerns housing issues and they remain of great interest to me. I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, is not present because I wanted to compliment him on his work and to wish him well in the lead up to the budget next week. As other speakers have stated, it is important that we support the work of the Minister of State and other Ministers. Everybody has a point of view on where Government funding should be used. I have an interest in the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, who is in the House, because I am anxious to have a new Garda station in Tallaght. With regard to housing, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, has the support of all colleagues in fighting his corner and trying to ensure that money is made available to continue to [54]properly fund social housing and other housing programmes. Last week, I brought to his attention my upset at newspaper reports that 291 proposed homes in South Dublin County Council’s programme for Tallaght were being axed. I understand this is not the position but I await confirmation. It is important that we continue to provide homes through local authorities and other schemes where people cannot get their own accommodation. I lived in the inner city many years ago. My family waited patiently for a Dublin Corporation house and then we lived in Crumlin. Much of what crosses our desks on housing, including a number of provisions included in this Bill, concerns issues with which I grew up. I am glad to be able to bring my life experience to my work as a Deputy for a major population centre. I am very happy about the experience I obtained over many years. Mr. Frank Feeley, the then city manager, told me a long time ago that I would survive as a politician because having been a member of the county council for only three or four weeks in 1991, I criticised Dublin Corporation. I did so because in those days Dublin Corporation had provided 5,000 houses in the Tallaght area but there was no accountability or public representation and we had to fight our corner as far as these issues were concerned. The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill contains a number of important provisions. It makes further provision for the functions of housing authorities. It provides for the making of housing services plans and the carrying out of social housing assessments for the purposes of social housing support and the allocation of dwellings. It also provides for rental accommodation arrangements and for the management and control functions of housing authorities. In addition, it provides for the making of antisocial behaviour strategies. It also makes further provision for tenant purchase of dwellings by incremental purchase arrangements. For these and other purposes it amends and extends the Housing Acts 1966 to 2004, the Housing Finance Agency Act 1981, the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Civil Registration Act 2004. It also provides for other related matters. I wish to address a number of issues, some of which were already mentioned by colleagues. I listened carefully to my fellow Dubliner, Deputy Catherine Byrne, when she spoke about homelessness. It is very important, even at this stage, that the Minister listens to those representing people affected by homelessness. There is a strong view, which has been represented to me throughout my constituency, that the question of homelessness should be addressed in the Bill. I have mentioned often that I live in Tallaght and thank God Tallaght has developed hugely over recent years and we are a city in all but name. However, despite the progress and the good things that have happened, which I have listed often so I will not test the patience of the Ceann Comhairle by doing so now, there are still gaps in services. I am very unhappy that there is still no provision in Tallaght, which is the third-largest population centre in the country, to deal with those who are homeless. There is no hostel. I have stated on many occasions that we send people with such a problem to Dublin city on the bus. That is not right. In this context I compliment the Tallaght Homeless Advice Unit, an organisation based in Tallaght village which does its best to cater for those who are homeless and provide them with information and resources to deal with their situation. I strongly support it. I receive quite an amount of correspondence from various groups, as I am sure do colleagues, including from St. Mary’s Priory, which makes the case for legislation to make a commitment on homelessness. Even at this stage, I hope the Minister will acknowledge and examine this. He has acknowledged the correspondence he has received from many colleagues with regard [55]to the MakeRoom group which has organised an online campaign on homelessness. The group makes strong points and I hope the Minister takes them into account. A number of colleagues raised issues which I feel strongly should be provided for in this Bill. We all receive representations from many groups and young people with regard to the operation of apartment management companies. All of our constituencies have had problems with these. Over recent years throughout Dublin South-West and in Tallaght there has been a huge increase in the development of apartments. In some cases this has been good and in others it has not. If one walks around Tallaght or any other place, and Deputy Catherine Byrne spoke about Crumlin, one sees a huge number of apartments lying idle. Nobody lives in them or uses them and this causes all sorts of problems, including antisocial behaviour. I wonder where this will end. I want to be positive about Tallaght but if one walks around Tallaght village, the new town centre area and a number of the estates one will find vacant apartments. 6 o’clock Where apartments are occupied I receive huge numbers of calls, as I know colleagues do also, about the operation of management companies. I hope the long-promised legislation on these issues will be fast-forwarded because many people are asking us to address this issue. It is very unfair that young people under much pressure, in good times as well as in more demanding economic times, receive fewer services than those to which they are entitled. In general, management companies seem to be very difficult to deal with. Not a day goes by that I do not receive inquiries in this regard. It is time that various Departments put their heads together and introduce legislation to deal with this problem. I hope this will be sooner rather than later. Colleagues made reference to tenant purchase, another area in which I am interested. It is important that we support the view that families should be assisted as much as possible in owning their own homes. That was my view all those years ago when I was reared in Crumlin. That was my view when I moved to Tallaght and when I became involved in community life and then political life. There was a time when the Government introduced a grant to assist people to leave local authority houses and to go to other places. I will not dig this up again, but it took families from local authority estates who were doing well, contributing to the local economy and the local community fabric. It is very important to encourage people to own their local authority homes as much as possible. Every effort should be made by the local authorities to ensure that people do that. I know the Minister is keen on this and we should encourage it. The question of antisocial behaviour is something that concerns us all. When I was small, I did not quite understand what it meant, but I know now that it is not just a modern phenomenon, even though it seems to have got worse. Where a family is living peacefully in a local authority estate, its members should not be hassled by people, have stones thrown at their windows, have their cars interfered with, have graffiti sprayed on their walls and so on. It is not happening just in my community, but everywhere in every county. Different colleagues will tell stories about antisocial behaviour. It is important that the local authorities are given as much power as is necessary to deal with this. I do not want to throw families out or penalise them, but where decent families are being hassled due to antisocial behaviour, it is important that action is taken. It should be done in a fair way. There is now talk about antisocial behaviour in every single community in the country, so it is important to get the point across. There have been stories in all our newspapers about graffiti attacks in different situations. We are used to seeing graffiti on walls, but houses are now being attacked in some communities. There was an incident in Old Bawn recently where people sprayed graffiti on the walls of houses in the area. I know we see graffiti everywhere we go in the world, but that does not [56]make it right. The local authorities and the Garda Síochána must understand that writing graffiti is a serious crime as far as the communities are concerned. I believe Senator Harris was quoted this morning as saying that sterner action should be taken for crimes against the person. I will certainly not disagree with that. He also made a point about crimes against property, but I would say to him that antisocial attacks on property upset people. It is right that they are condemned, and I am not a bit afraid to condemn them. I spoke earlier about the need for people to be accommodated. All of us who deal with housing list applications are aware that the emphasis is always on catering for family units, which is fair enough. The number of three bedroom houses being funded is greater than the number of two bedroom and one bedroom apartments. There is not much of an argument against that policy, except for the fact that there are different groupings of families that need to be catered for. The separated fathers’ group, which is based in Tallaght but which is known to many people in the region, makes the point about single fathers. It is very difficult for local authorities to concentrate on one group rather than another group, and it is certainly not popular to concentrate on a group to the extent that more formal family units are eliminated from the list. However, it is a demand on the services in this modern age, and it is important to state this. The local authorities need to grapple with that challenge. I know it is a difficult challenge and it is far more prevalent today than it was ten or 20 years ago. I do eight advice clinics every week in my constituency, and the number of single fathers with that problem has increased. Local authorities used to have a scheme which was known as 'accommodation in lieu'. If an application was received from somebody who was already in a family but needed his or her own accommodation, such as a single parent, a provision existed whereby a local authority could allow accommodation in lieu to be built on to the house. The applicant could then live close to the family home. I know there were reasons given when it was discontinued, but I still get inquiries about this. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has just joined us, will know that we must continue to look at a range of innovative schemes to ensure that local authority housing stocks remain strong and that people who have a clear need for local authority housing are still facilitated. I hope that somebody will look at that. I do not want to turn the clock back, but if there is a challenge——",Byrne
"Tááthas orm seans a fháil labhairt sa díospóireacht ar an rún an-tábhachtach seo. Beidh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag tabhairt tacaíocha don rún, cé go bhfuil nithe áirithe ag cur imní orainn, mar shampla an tacaíocht atá ag teastáil ó thaobh fearais, cúrsaí leighis agus córais taistil. Má bhíonn an tacaíocht is caoi ar fáil, creidim go n-éireoidh go maith le saighdiúrí na hÉireann a bheidh páirteach i MINURCAT. Beidh na daoine atá faoi bhrú uafásach i Sead faoi láthair go mór níos fearr as. Beidh mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire a dheimhniú go mbeidh an tacaíocht sin ar fáil. The Labour Party will support the motion moved by the Minister for Defence against the background of the deepening humanitarian crisis in Darfur and eastern Chad. Approximately a quarter of a million lives have been lost in the conflict in Darfur while more than 2 million people have been displaced. The Labour Party supports the deployment of 400 Irish UN-sanctioned troops to eastern Chad but has concerns regarding the resourcing of the mission, as well as the safety and welfare of our troops. Following his four-day visit to Chad and the Sudan earlier this month, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated that the environment in which the Irish troops will be located is one of the harshest in the world. He described the terrain as stark and noted that temperatures can reach up to 45° Celsius. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also noted there were no roads to speak of and that travel over land can be very time consuming and, in some instances, dangerous. The Minister pointed out that for the mission to be a success, it must get the full support of member states. This involves ensuring the troops will be provided with the requisite medical supplies, hardware and, in particular, helicopters to get around. According to the Minister, only three helicopters were deployed at the time of his visit, while the French peacekeep[1228]ers there have insisted that 20 are needed to support the troops in the region. What has been the response to the plea to European governments by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to supply much-needed transport for the thousands of troops on this humanitarian mission to central Africa? I note the Minister for Defence has also made similar pleas. The unfolding humanitarian crisis in the region in recent years is not due solely to an overspill of the conflict from the Darfur region of Sudan as local tribal and ethnic tensions are also a factor. The situation is further compounded by the actions of militias and bandit groups. The Irish deployment of 400 troops will form the second largest component of the 4,300 troops which will make up the UN-mandated EU force. France is to contribute more than half the force, which will facilitate humanitarian access, as well as protecting refugees from Darfur and displaced Chadians who populate the camps in eastern Chad. This extraordinarily difficult and demanding mission is not without its dangers and is the most challenging to date. Today, Members will complete the triple lock mechanism, following the mission’s approval by the Government and that of the UN last September. All Members are proud of our troops and have full confidence that they will make a major contribution in this most difficult situation. It is a matter of particular pride that on Tuesday, 9 October 2007, this House unanimously approved the despatch of Lieutenant General Pat Nash to the position of operations commander for the proposed EU military operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic. The challenge posed by this mission is illustrated by considering that Chad, which is the main area of operation, is the same size as France, while the total area involved is the same as France, Germany and Spain combined. Moreover, Chad is landlocked and is approximately 2,000 km from the nearest port. I understand the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces has described the threat level related to this mission as one of medium risk. One issue to arise concerns the potential for our troops to be drawn into the government-rebel conflict there. There is also the matter of the increasing level of banditry on vulnerable targets, while the risk from breakaway rebel factions seeking arms, ammunition and vehicles is on the increase. Reportedly, the Irish Army mission, which is to be the most expensive ever, will cost €57 million. Only yesterday, there were reports of hundreds being killed in fighting in eastern Chad. The Chadian army stated that several hundred rebels were killed in fighting on Monday last, while the rebels stated that 200 soldiers and only 20 of their fighters were killed. This incident may well constitute the heaviest fighting since last year. The Minister noted that following the passing of the motion in the House today, the initial entry force, which I understand will consist of up to 70 [1229]troops, will be deployed next month. In addition to the ranger wing, it will include logistics and communications specialists who will join the UN forces already in eastern Chad. This will facilitate the subsequent arrival of the remaining troops to be deployed. Despite the signing of a peace deal last month between the Chadian Government and four rebel groups, clashes continue, not least last Monday’s incident. The existence of 180,000 displaced Chadians and 236,000 Sudanese refugees living in camps in eastern Chad, as well as the continuing fighting, gives an indication of the difficulties that face the mission. The Minister has already outlined the horrific treatment of women in the camps and the huge problem associated with malnutrition. Consequently, a range of skills will be required from our contingent in Chad. While one does not wish to reflect on former times when sad events have taken place, Members should recall the people who were lost in the Congo in the early 1960s. Although Members hope and pray there will be no fatalities in the present mission, it is always a possibility. This raises again the issue whether the medical and hardware backup will be available. The question that probably will be of the greatest ultimate importance is whether the 20 helicopters required will be supplied, as opposed to the three that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, indicated were available during his recent visit. The Minister for Defence should outline to the House the progress that has been made in this regard in the interim. I seek an undertaking from the Minister that he will hold firm until the appropriate and adequate backup is in place for our troops. The initial force, comprising 50 to 70 personnel, will deploy in December to get things ready for the main contingent to follow. Can Members be certain that all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our troops in Chad from the perspective of health, safety and general security will be taken? Can the Minister provide Members with more information regarding the problems with fighting in the region? Has he had official confirmation or does he possess reliable figures regarding the incident that took place last Monday? The figures involved are startling and it appears that just as our troops are about to be deployed, the worst incident since last year has just taken place. Previously, I have raised in the House the issue arising from the incident in which an attempt was made to take children from Chad. What is the up-to-date information in that regard? It appears that these children were being taken abroad to be fostered and perhaps in some cases to be adopted, but in a significant number of cases the children involved had at least one parent. The House should be informed of whether there is any danger of human trafficking, especially child trafficking, occurring in the area and to what extent this has been taken into consideration in the planning of the mission. [1230]None of us should underestimate this undertaking or the challenge it presents. A number of international political issues are bound up in this matter. The resourcefulness and skill of our troops and officers in eastern Chad will be called upon, especially in terms of diplomacy and on other levels. I have no doubt our people will rise to the occasion. We all expressed great confidence in Major General Pat Nash when we debated the authorisation of his appointment as operations commander for this mission. We have the people to do this job, which very badly needs to be done. It is obvious that the humanitarian crisis in Chad is worsening. If our people do not have the tools to do the job in the most effective way, serious issues will arise when we will deploy people to take part fully in the mission. I am seeking information and guidance from the Minister. It is quite probable that he has a great deal more information than he has already told us. I am not aware of anything being flagged in terms of where the additional helicopters will come from. I read a report which stated there are 400 km of road in the area to which the Army is going, which is pretty minimal when one considers the vast area with which the mission will be dealing. The Labour Party is proud that the Permanent Defence Force is to take part in this mission. I believe it will make a contribution that will bring great credit to its members, the Defence Forces generally and to the country, but those involved must be given the tools to do the job and the wherewithal to protect themselves from the point of view of health and security.",Ahern
"It goes without saying that elements of this legislation are overdue. Ireland is unique within the European Union in that it does not have a charities register. There is no legal obligation on organisations not registered as companies to publish their accounts. I have had experience of people who masqueraded as bona fide charities and I agree that, in general, reform is necessary. I support the reforming measures in the Bill. Where I may depart from my colleagues on this issue is in respect of the establishment of a new authority. Why do we assume that matters would improve purely on the basis of the setting up of such an authority? Why can we not equally assume that the Government has not been reforming in this area and simply has not done its job? I am not convinced that a new authority is necessary. [551]Reform is overdue, as are the specific reforming measures contained in the legislation. On many occasions, however, we seem to view reform almost as a reason for making government bigger. In my opinion, the act of creating an authority and a tribunal to accompany it is not, by its nature, reform, nor are developments of this nature always the solution. I understand that if the legislation is passed, the Minister could, under statutory regulation, make policy in respect of charities. Whenever a problem arises, in some instances the accepted response does not necessarily deal with the issues at hand, nor does it make government leaner, more streamlined or more efficient. On foot of the fact that Ireland is a rich country and, by extension, has a rich Government, we tend to create new bodies or authorities or new managerial levels within organisations. It emerged earlier today that in the HSE there is one manager for every six employees. I am not convinced that this reforming measure can be dealt with by the Department sponsoring this Bill. When the legislation was first announced, the justification put forward in respect of the proposed authority was that no central body exists. That does not necessarily mean that we should automatically have an authority or a regulator. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill refers to an annual budget of €4 million being set aside. The Minister of State did not indicate how this money would be provided. He referred to different jurisdictions but did not identify any of them or outline any of the foreign models the Department has examined. He also referred to people working in the Department who are dealing with charity-related issues. There are obviously many individuals in the Department who have a great deal of experience in dealing with such matters. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that the 'issue will be subject of further discussions with the Department of Finance at the appropriate time'. This is a problematic and vague statement. It is similar to constructing something and then figuring out the cost after the fact. My interest was peaked when the Bill was published as a result of the comments made by the senior Minister at the Department, Deputy Ó Cuív, not two or five years ago or when he was a county councillor, but last week, in respect of the HSE. Many Deputies might agree with him, particularly in light of their day-to-day dealings with the HSE. The Minister stated: 'I’ve always been sceptical of the model that divorces the running of all these agencies from Government control.' Now, however, his Department is putting forward an item of legislation that proposes the creation of a new agency. Obviously the Minister is not that sceptical of the model because we are [552]engaging with it today. It is one thing to be outvoted or outnumbered in Cabinet in respect of a particular issue. In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, never held the post of Minister for Health and Children. However, he is the line Minister responsible for dealing with this matter. One cannot have it both ways and it was abject hypocrisy for him to make a statement such as that which he issued last week and then set about creating a new agency this week. Why could the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, not deal with this matter? He has experience of charitable issues and why could he not deal with it within the Department. The Minister of State has not provided an answer in this regard but he must do so. He must also make it clear why his Department should not continue to deal with charitable issues rather than transferring responsibility for them to a new agency which will cost the Exchequer €4 million and which will ultimately cost charities a great deal of money because they will be taxed. The establishment of agencies of this nature always leads to people and organisations being taxed. Let us be clear what the legislation does, particularly in the context of what the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, stated. The Bill provides for the transfer of all jurisdictions issued in the Attorney General, by statute or common law, in respect of charities. The authority’s powers will be quite extensive and harsh. It will, for example: . . . have the power to institute investigations to call for documents and search records to enter premises on foot of a search warrant to impose sanctions, including intermediate sanctions and to co-operate on an administrative basis with foreign statutory bodies on law enforcement matters. There will also be significant penalties in place for offences under the legislation. When I first read this, I thought I was looking at the terms of reference of the FBI. However, when I re-examined it, I realised that the latter does not have unilateral power to impose sanctions. There is, therefore, a difference of sorts. The Law Reform Commission issued a report on this matter in December 2005. The Minister of State indicated that the report was issued last year. That is not the case it was published well over 18 months ago. I am aware of this because I read it on the Internet last night. The Law Reform Commission recommended the introduction of a new form of legal structure for charities. It did not make any definite recommendation in respect of a regulator or a new authority. The Minister of State glossed over those facts. His Department has had a great deal of time to peruse the 55-page report the Law Reform Commission compiled. That report contains some quite detailed recommendations and suggestions. For example, it suggested an entirely different [553]legal framework when it comes to charities. A number of reports relating to this matter have been issued in the past 16 years and the Minister of State must explain why the Law Reform Commission’s recommendations were not taken into account before the legislation was drafted. I welcome the reform elements of the legislation, which are long overdue. Many charities have been the subject of fraud. As already stated, we are making government bigger and when one takes that route, one must consider the necessity of what one is doing and the cost implications to the Exchequer. It may be a bad example — most Deputies will understand from where I am coming in respect of it — but I was elected seven or eight years ago and I have seen government replicate and grow inordinately. Even if one contacts a local authority engineer these days, the chances are that the project about which one is inquiring has been contracted out to a consultancy firm and is not being done in-house. Government continues to grow and, in many cases, there is no good reason for this. We need to ask ourselves whether outsourcing government work or creating new bodies necessarily makes government better. The Minister of State should provide a clear explanation as to why it is absolutely necessary to create a stand-alone authority such as that envisaged. It was interesting to hear other Deputies almost pleading with the Minister of State to have replies issued to them when the new authority is established. When we table questions relating to charitable organisations or charity in general in the future, the position is unclear as to whether we will receive replies. We should not be doing this. The Minister of State must explain why responsibility for this matter is being outsourced from the Government. It is not as simple as introducing legislation and creating a new authority. The Government has neglected this area and failed badly in respect of it for a long period. The Minister of State knows it is not as simple as that. He must explain why he, as Minister of State with jurisdiction over charitable issues, cannot do it within his own Department with his own staff and within his own budget. Deputy Jim O’Keeffe raised an interesting point when he discussed one section where the authority is described as independent and another section which states that the authority is subject to ministerial or Government direction. The Minister of State must explain that because there is a real contradiction in respect of those two sections. I am glad my party has refrained from giving an absolute decision on this Bill. We all welcome the reform measures within it. However, before any support is given unconditionally to this Bill, the Minister of State must explain why he could not deal with this within his own Department with his own staff and budgets and why we con[554]tinue to put these new authorities together. It does not necessarily mean that Government will get better. Sometimes it just means it will get bigger.",O'Keeffe
"I propose to take Questions Nos. 666 and 667 together. [351]As outlined in the reply to Question No. 1370 of 30 January 2008, the 20-year National Spatial Strategy (NSS) which was published in November 2002, aims to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development across Ireland, supported by more effective planning, and has designated nine gateways and nine hubs which have the capacity to grow sustainably and to act as drivers of growth for their hinterlands and wider regions. Among the principal objectives of the Strategy are to build up the strengths of all areas in order to achieve more balanced regional development through a better spread of economic activity, employment and population growth to energise the potential of all urban and rural areas with the support of a stronger urban structure, including the gateways, hubs and other towns and to set a national context for regional and local planning strategies. The Department has taken due account of changing economic and demographic circumstances since the publication of the Strategy, through for example, revised regional population targets, on foot of the Census 2006 data analysis, which are being reflected in regional and local plans. Investment priorities identified under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and Transport 21 are fully aligned with the NSS. The 2004 Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs), which are due to be reviewed by 2010, translate the NSS objectives into concrete actions at local level. City and County Councils have regard to the NSS and regional priorities in their development plan and local area planning processes. My Department has undertaken extensive research into the development issues and challenges of the nine Hub towns. This work culminated in the publication in June 2007 of the report, NSS Hubs – Development Issues and Challenges, which is available on the Department’s website –www. environ. ie— and the dedicated NSS website –www. irishspatialstrategy. ie. Based on responses to a comprehensive questionnaire completed by each of the hub local authorities, the study provides a detailed description of the current status of the hubs, identifies the many development issues and challenges associated with the hubs and makes recommendations to support and advance future hub growth and development. On foot of this study, my Department is considering how best to implement the recommendations at both central and local Government levels. Responsibility has been assigned to my colleague, Minister of State Batt O’Keeffe, to support work at central and local government levels to secure better co-ordination and timely delivery of key infrastructure and services in fast growing developing areas. The initial focus is on strategic locations which are experiencing significant development pressures within the gateways and hubs.",O'Keeffe
"On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I welcome the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Review of Rent in Certain Cases) (Amendment) Bill 2010 and commend my colleague, Deputy Ciaran Lynch, on introducing it. It is not a perfect Bill and I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge that he does not have a monopoly of wisdom on it. Opposition Members do not have available to them the same level of expertise as those on the Government benches. If this Bill is not perfect, let us discuss it in committee so that we can deal with the contentious issues on an all-party basis to ensure we address the problem. I am keenly aware of the enormous pressures that commercial tenants face. Retail Excellence Ireland and the Grafton Street Tenants Association have done an excellent job in highlighting the dire straits in which many tenants now find themselves. Sadly, in recent times, a number of landmark businesses in Dublin city centre have closed their doors with a loss of jobs and, in some cases, cultural capital where shops that have been part of the fabric of Grafton Street for decades have simply disappeared overnight. The problem of unsustainable rents is felt in cities and towns around the country, including in my own local towns of Portlaoise and Tullamore. No business is immune from the current economic meltdown and those trapped in commercial leases paying exorbitant rents are in a particularly difficult situation as they struggle for their very survival. Last year Fine Gael supported section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2009 because it reflected our policy to abolish upward-only rents. At the time, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, suggested that the section could not apply to existing leases but that view has been disputed by Professor David Gwynn Morgan, who has argued that in recent decades several laws have been introduced that modified existing [445]landlord and tenant leases. The matter may not be as black and white as the Minister has suggested, therefore. Precedents include the Shirley case, the Landlord and Tenants (Ground Rents) Act 1978, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1931 and the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980, all of which affected existing leases and tenant-landlord relations. I regret the negative tone taken by the Minister, who spoke for 20 minutes but offered nothing. Notwithstanding constitutional arguments, dialogue is needed at this time. Many landlords have engaged with their commercial tenants because they recognised the writing on the wall and reduced rents to reflect changed times. However, I understand that tenants have had particular difficulties with large commercial landlords and Government intervention is needed in this context. The Minister is in a unique position in that he can call people into Government Buildings to facilitate the resolution of disputes. The ability to bring people together is one of the most powerful aspects of being a Minister. Unfortunately, this Government has been slow to make use of its potential to mediate as we have seen with the Tánaiste and Ryanair. It would be a lost opportunity if the Minister did not dedicate his energies to resolving the upward-only rents crisis, a word which I do not use lightly. I acknowledge that he has established a working group to examine the adequacy of information available to all parties in the context of commercial rent reviews. While I welcome what at least represents some action, I am somewhat surprised by the group’s narrow remit. When the Minister outlined the group’s membership, I did not hear him mention a representative from the Grafton Street Tenants Association or Retail Excellence Ireland. 9 o’clock The reality is that commercial leaseholders are the victims of a rare approach to commercial leases that Ireland adopted from the UK. It is time we recognised our place in Europe by adopting international best practice in landlord and tenant law. Within the EU, commercial rents are linked to inflation and leases tend to be for shorter terms and contain break clauses. These regimes are fairer and more reflective of the realities of commercial life. Such a progressive approach is long overdue in Ireland and I am calling on the Minister to consider introducing a new Bill which would consolidate existing landlord and tenant legislation as well as modernising this area of law. The Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2009 was only a first step in overhauling the conveyancing and landlord-tenant regime. That Act arose from a seminal report by the Law Reform Commission in 2005 and I believe the commission should be asked by the Attorney General to prioritise a report on consolidating and modernising landlord and tenant law. Our key focus must be the preservation of jobs. Fine Gael has expressed concern about the lack of competitiveness in the Irish economy and the negative role that high commercial rents are playing in that environment. Ministerial intervention is needed immediately to preserve jobs. The Labour Party’s Bill is welcome but it represents a short-term solution. What Fine Gael would like to see is the introduction of new measures that would allow businesses to apply to court for rent reviews in exceptional circumstances. This would afford greater protection to businesses. What is certain is that festering sore of upward-only rents can be resolved with political and legislative will. I call on the Minister, Deputy Ahern, to roll up his sleeves and get involved. A solution could be achieved that could benefit all parties and I trust this is what he will decide to do now, as well as taking on board the policy proposals of Fine Gael in this area.",Ahern
"I thank Deputies for their contributions on this important motion. It is a Government motion, not a Fianna Fáil one. The Government comprises more than Fianna Fáil members. There will be many other opportunities in the near future to talk about wider issues concerning both the past and future. We are debating the extension of an existing scheme, not a new one. More than ever before, this is a time for realism and an objective assessment of the situation. As stated by the Taoiseach earlier today on the Order of Business, the necessity for the bank guarantee arrangements was compelling. As the Minister for Finance stated at the time the scheme was extended at end-year on 29 September 2008, had that guarantee not been introduced we would scarcely have an economy today, never mind a banking system. Some reference was made to the misgivings of the former head of the NTMA, Dr. Somers. As he has admitted himself, however, he did not pass that on, or certainly not at a political level. Some of the criticisms suggest that the Government should have taken in the whole situation and all the future consequences on or before the end of September 2008. The Government was not able to foresee all that has developed since, but at all times it has acted in good faith. The entire banking system faced collapse at that time and funding for our banking system has all but dried up. In other words, there was a liquidity issue at least in the short term and the banks faced closure within days. This is starkly illustrated in the report by the Governor of [324]the Central Bank, Professor Honohan. In the first chapter of the report, referring to the discussions that took place on the night of 29 September 2008 — he was not Governor of the Central Bank at that time — Professor Honohan stated: It is hard to argue with the view that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place since all participants rightly felt that they faced the likely collapse of the Irish banking system within days in the absence of decisive, immediate action. Given the hysterical state of global financial markets in those weeks, failure to avoid this outcome would have resulted in immediate and lasting damage to the economy and society and there would have been additional lost income and employment surely amounting, if it could be quantified, to tens of billions of euros. Unfortunately, some commentators have chosen to ignore Professor Honohan’s conclusion entirely. They have obscured and confused it in the public’s mind by relying on criticisms the Governor made to the scope of the guarantee — for example, the inclusion of dated subordinated debt. The Minister for Finance has responded to and addressed these points on many occasions. Even in today’s conditions, we see the treatment of subordinated bondholders is still capable of causing some turbulence, as I think one speaker accepted by implication. There have been blanket guarantees in the past, notably in Sweden, which is often regarded as a template for dealing with a banking crisis. That country provided a blanket guarantee in the 1990s. It could be argued that we were exceptionally vulnerable in the situation that had developed. A comprehensive guarantee of bank liabilities was an established part of the standard tool-kit for responding to systemic banking crises internationally, and it continues to be so today. As I have said, other countries such as Sweden in the 1990s and Denmark in the current crisis, have introduced extensive guarantees of bank liabilities. The UK authorities provided a broad guarantee to existing senior bondholders in Northern Rock. Guarantees are a facet of the response of EU member states to the ongoing financial crisis. Ireland has not been alone in providing a guarantee to underpin the funding position of its banking system. We were the first to introduce a guarantee but we were quickly followed by other EU member states. Recent figures from the European Commission suggest that since the onset of the crisis in 2008, under state aid rules the Commission authorised some €3. 6 trillion in guarantees. In total, some 21 guarantee schemes were approved by the Commission and 12 of them remain in force today. The latest figures indicating some €147 billion of liabilities are guaranteed under the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, which equates to 4% of the amount authorised by the Commission. Member states implementing guarantee schemes include Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and Poland. Commissioner Almunia, the Vice-President of the European Commission who is responsible for competition policy, indicated in a speech earlier this month that his current idea is to extend the European Union’s financial crisis regime, which will include national guarantee arrangements, until the end of 2011. We must understand the distinction between what was necessary to stabilise the situation and what is sufficient. The steps taken from September 2008 were certainly necessary. To date, that has not been sufficient to provide normalisation of the banking system, far from it. However, it does not follow that because of the lack of sufficiency, all or many of the earlier measures were not necessary. Along with the eurozone as a whole, Ireland remains in stormy financial waters. The prolongation of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme is a key element of the Government’s response to the broader systemic challenges facing the banking system. I reiterate the State’s commitment to safeguard the interests of depositors in Irish banks. The objective is shared by [325]the eurogroup and supported by the European Commission, the ECB and all authorities with an interest in continuing to maintain the stability of the Irish banking system. In that regard the European Central Bank continues to meet the liquidity requirements of the banking system. This scheme guarantees the security of all deposits in the participating institutions, along with that of other bank liabilities guaranteed under it. The scheme complements the protection afforded to all deposits up to €100,000 under the permanent deposit guarantee scheme, which has no expiry date. As the Taoiseach stated yesterday, the protection of depositors remains one of the overarching priorities of the Government in responding to the difficulties in the Irish banking system. In response to Deputy Brian Hayes, the urgency of approving the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme and providing certainty about its extension should be evident to all. Failure by the House to approve the scheme would exacerbate uncertainty regarding the future funding of Ireland’s banking system. At this time of market turbulence, a decision now on the extension of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme is not only necessary, but also a responsible action for the State to take to underpin the funding position of the institutions. Delay would only fuel uncertainty and weaken the banking system. In addition to the eurogroup statement, I draw attention to the European Commission state aid approval and endorsement of the guarantee by the ECB on financial stability grounds. Deputy Brian Hayes, Deputy Burton and possibly others raised the question of a bank resolution regime. The Minister for Finance recently indicated in the House that he was examining options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal in a systematic way with distressed financial institutions to ensure the State has a range of tools to address problem institutions effectively in the interests of maintaining financial stability, minimising reliance on public money and ensuring continuity of key banking activities. In view of the central role performed by central banks in resolution frameworks for financial institutions, the Department is consulting with the Central Bank to develop the necessary legislative proposals. The Minister expects this process will lead to the introduction of an appropriate legislative framework for bank restructuring in line with what the House wishes to see. Several Deputies raised the involvement of outside parties. The Irish Government has expressed its determination to work with its EU colleagues and specifically to work with the ECB, the Commission and the IMF to address these market turbulences, to see where there are credit risks to Ireland in the market and how they can be addressed. Talks will begin at official level in Dublin this week, with a delegation from the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank on the possible use of EU and IMF funding to deal with the banking crisis. I welcome the statement by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 90 years of independence I do not believe there has been such a statement made of the degree to which the British economy depends on the Irish market.",Hayes
"Over a 23 month period, phase one of the Change. ie campaign raised awareness of the importance of climate change and engaged people and organisations across the country in changing their behaviour. 138,870 individuals have calculated their carbon number using the campaign’s personal calculator and 588 organisations have used the business carbon management tool. Three rounds of dedicated research commissioned to track awareness and receptiveness of the campaign’s messages demonstrate that it succeeded in raising awareness of climate change and effectively engaged people and organisations across Ireland in changing their behaviour. Specifically, the research shows that: three out of four Irish people believe that climate change is coming about as a result of human behaviour rather than as a natural process there is 100% awareness of at least one initiative undertaken under the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 the campaign has motivated 70% of Irish people to take steps to reduce their carbon number and just three months after the campaign commenced, seven out of ten people in Ireland felt 'it would be easy to take corrective action to reduce their carbon number'. Given current economic circumstances, I decided in 2009 to conclude phase one of the campaign the 'Change' brand has been maintained by my Department and phase two of the campaign is being managed internally. Among the measures involved are the development of a Greening Communities Network and the planned dissemination of a climate change educational resource across the primary school network. The Change. ie website content has been integrated into the climate change content of the www. ENFO. ie site and will continue to be developed by An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, with the support of my Department, while the calculators continue to be maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency.

"I am grateful for the opportunity to comment in regard to the extension of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme. This debate comes at a fundamentally important time for our country, when we are about to embark on very important discussions with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF in an effort to resolve the ongoing difficulties in the international money markets. In that regard, I wish the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, his colleagues in Government and the officials who represent us every success in the discussions which commence tomorrow in Dublin. We all accept that the over-riding objective is to wean the banks off the life support machine that is the State guarantee. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing pressures in the market, it is clear that we are not in a position to take them off life support at this stage. They are effectively unable to raise funds on the international money markets and, when they are able to, they do so at rates that are so exorbitant the impact would be that they would have to pass on very high interest rates to both personal and commercial customers in Ireland. Clearly, that is a point of major concern. When Bank of Ireland raised money on the international markets in recent weeks, the cost was approximately 5. 5%, which is a very significant cost, and it must add its margin to that, resulting in high interest being charged to the end customer. Before I deal with the extension of the ELG scheme, I want to go back to the original guarantee decision in September 2008. To pick up on some of the comments made at the outset of this debate in the House today, the impression was given by Fine Gael spokespeople, for example, that the Government knew there was a fundamental insolvency issue with Anglo Irish Bank. That is not the case, as the record shows. For example, there is the report which Merrill Lynch submitted to the Government on the eve of the Government guarantee, which was e-mailed at 6. 43 p. m. on 29 September 2008 to the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. Kevin Cardiff. On the first page of that memo, Merrill Lynch stated: The liquidity issues facing Irish banks are compounded by investor concerns with regard to the high concentration of commercial property risk in their respective asset portfolios . . . The three institutions where these liquidity issues have been most pronounced have been Irish Nationwide, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life & Permanent . . . It is important to stress that at present, liquidity concerns aside, all of the Irish banks are profitable and well capitalised. However, liquidity for some could run out in days rather than weeks. This was the summary of Merrill Lynch, which had been commissioned by the Government and sent a summary of its work to the Government on the day before the guarantee. Those words could not be clearer — liquidity concerns aside, its view, based on the information it [313]had been able to access, was that all of the banks were profitable and well capitalised. We know now that this was not the case, and Merrill Lynch was not able to get to the bottom of the issues in the banking system, in particular in regard to Anglo Irish Bank, in the time it had to do its work. I make the point to highlight the fact it is simply incorrect to state that the advice available to the Government leading up to the guarantee at the end of September 2008 was that the Irish banks were insolvent. This was the professional consulting firm commissioned to advise the Government and to prepare a report, and that is essentially what it found on the eve of the guarantee. It is important we are at least honest and put forward the true position. It has also been said by earlier speakers that the guarantee was in many respects a disaster for the country, and many politicians have put forward this point of view. It is important to reflect on what the Governor, Professor Honohan, said when he examined this issue as part of his preliminary banking report. He stated that it was hard to argue with the view that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place since all participants correctly believed that we faced the likely collapse of the Irish banking system within days in the absence of decisive and immediate action. Given the hysterical state of global financial markets in those weeks, failure to avoid this outcome would have resulted in immediate and lasting damage to the economy and society. He went on to criticise the inclusion of subordinated debt, which accounted for in excess of 3% of the total liabilities guaranteed at the end of September 2008. That was a fair criticism which can be debated in a legitimate manner. However, the substance of the guarantee was strongly supported by the Governor in the report he brought forward upon request by resolution of this House. The important objective which we are trying to achieve is to move eventually from a situation where the banks are completely reliant on the State guarantee and on the European Central Bank for ongoing funding requirements to a position where they can access funding on the international money markets at reasonable rates and which will not effectively cripple their ability to serve the needs of the economy here, including personal customers seeking mortgages, personal loans, the crucial small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector and the corporate sector generally. Some of the comments and concerns expressed in recent days regarding the security of people’s deposits in Irish institutions are most unhelpful. We must be crystal clear on this point. The money people have in Irish institutions is safe at several levels through the deposit guarantee scheme, which covers up to €100,000 per person in each institution. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware, this is underpinned by the European directive. The eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme is also in place, which we propose to extend until the end of next year. If seeds of doubt are sown in people’s minds about the security of their money in the Irish banks, they will simply move their money and the problems of the banks in terms of their funding and capital bases will be significantly worsened, an outcome no one wishes to see unfold. We must reassure people that their money is safe and the passage of the motion today will help to copper-fasten this position. I welcome the Minister’s confirmation earlier today of the amount of money which has been collected on foot of the parent guarantee and the eligible liabilities guarantee amounting to €1. 3 billion at the end of October. The average fee charged under the ELG scheme is approximately ten times more then the fee charged under the original guarantee from September 2008, which is important. Important discussions will begin here tomorrow between the Government, the European Central Bank, ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, on issues fundamental to the country’s future. If the outcome of those discussions is that funding is [314]needed for the Irish banks, then the taxpayers and citizens of the State should not be asked to take on the bill. We have already committed up to €50 billion to rescue the Irish banks and the burden of any further funding which may be extended to the Irish banks should not be put on the shoulders of this generation or any future generations of the people. This point should be emphasised and it should form the cornerstone of the Government’s handling of the discussions that will take place in the coming days. I welcome the statement last night from the eurogroup, which gave its full support to the efforts the Government has taken and continues to take to face up to the fiscal challenges in the country. The group gave its full support to the achievement of a 3% deficit target by 2014, the four-year plan and the €6 billion front-loading in the forthcoming budget on 7 December. Everyone in the House agrees that we must have as much support as possible in the weeks and months ahead to resolve the outstanding issues such that we can secure proper recovery and growth in the economy.",Lenihan

"We have had a litany of eminent persons from the Fianna Fáil Party — Deputy Andrews, Deputy Kennedy, Deputy O’Keeffe, Deputy McGrath, Deputy Aylward, Deputy Kelly and Deputy Byrne — saying rightly that the McCarthy report should be published. If the Taoiseach did not want it published he should have said to Mr. McCarthy at the outset, 'I don’t want to see your report and don’t come here with your report until the middle of October'. The Taoiseach did not say that and the Minister for Finance is now in possession of this document.

"I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the budget. There is much public worry over the state of the economy. I have been talking to my constituents in Donegal and know their concern is very real. The issue is not unique to Ireland. We are in the midst of a global economic crisis but we are better equipped for it than many. Difficult decisions had to be made by the Government to deliver its budget. The decisions are ones we would rather not have to take but they are necessary in these uncertain times. There is no credit to be derived from delivering stricter budgetary controls in respect of social welfare benefits, schools, hospitals, farmers, PAYE workers or senior citizens but these measures were necessary. Consider some of the measures proposed by the Opposition, particularly Fine Gael. The Government announced cuts of €2 billion while Fine Gael proposed cuts of €4 billion. I would love to know the circumstances we would be in if cuts of €4 billion had been made. I wonder whether the Opposition really realises where it stands on budgets. The measures of the Government were taken to ensure the progress of the past decade will be protected and that the country will be best placed to take advantage of the inevitable upturn in the international economy when it occurs. Our economy is much better insulated from the difficulties it will face over the coming years than it was from the difficulties it faced in the 1980s. That is the reality. We are tackling the problem head on and I am confident the Government will see Ireland though this storm. Our focus is upon generating economic growth through employment, assisting industry and enhancing economic competitiveness. [849]The Government’s decision to guarantee deposits in Irish banks in an effort to restore confidence was courageous and was replicated in many European countries. We have led the way in times of despair and other countries are examining our movements in order to try to keep up with us. That is what this Government was elected to do, to manage the economy. That is what we are doing in this difficult time, not taking short-term decisions but looking further down the road to ensure the growth we have enjoyed can come back again. 9 o’clock Much was offered in the budget in terms of social welfare for those more in need. Improvements in family income supplement for low-income working families have been introduced and there have also been increases in child-related payments to those dependent on social welfare. A further 18,000 families will become eligible for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which is much needed by many families across the country. Much worry and anxiety have been expressed in recent days by older people in respect of the availability of medical cards. Like others, my office was inundated with calls from pensioners who were concerned they might lose their medical card. I am delighted the Taoiseach made the decision he did. It certainly shows this Government is prepared to listen to the people. We did not bring in decisions just because we liked to but we wanted to look after all concerned, particularly those in need. I believe the revisions of the scheme will satisfy the vast majority. The closure of two Army barracks in my county has also caused much concern among staff and Army personnel in Rockhill and Lifford. Unfortunately, the running of these barracks is extremely costly and it has been decided the personnel will be facilitated at Finner Army camp in the near future. I have been told this decision was reached for two main reasons. The first is cost savings the second is that there is less requirement for excess Army barracks along the Border because of the changed situation arising from the peace process in Northern Ireland. It is envisaged the proceeds of the sale of Rockhill and Lifford barracks will produce substantial resources for the modernisation process in the defence organisation. At this time, it may be tempting to become negative about what we have achieved in this country over the past ten to 20 years but I wish to focus on the positive. The value of GDP increased in Ireland by over 70% between 1970 and 2006, which is well above the EU average. National debt as a percentage of GDP has fallen from over 87% in 1990 to just over 20% in 2006. This economy has been booming for many years and nobody can deny the progress made in this country over the last ten to 20 years. We have all been part of building it and we have all enjoyed it. Irish emigrants came back home on holiday and could barely recognise their home towns so great was the progress and we must not forget that. We experienced incredible growth and prosperity and the economy is now taking a hit but with proper management provided by this Government I believe things will level out. The good times will be back but at this critical point the emphasis is on damage limitation. The economic outlook has changed. However, after the strong performance of our economy over many years this Government is in the best possible position to navigate its way through the challenges that lie ahead. That is what we intend to do and our focus must be on positioning Ireland to participate in the global upturn. Of late, the Opposition has been playing political football with our economy. It plays the blame game concerning the economic problems faced by this country. Over ten years ago, the Opposition decided to freeze direct school funding and also proposed cutting teacher numbers. It also cut by £20 million the budget for school buildings and renovation. This is in stark contrast to the record of the current Government. During the past 11 years the Government has invested unprecedented amounts of money in building roads and schools. We must all look [850]to our own constituencies and see the number of school buildings and extension works, the number of houses built at local authority level and the water schemes and sewage treatment plants built during this period. The Government has spent billions of euro on increased pensions, children’s allowance, carer’s allowance and other social welfare benefits. Spending on health, education and social welfare was increased dramatically in this budget. Times are tougher now and everybody will feel the strain in disposable income but I wonder which of the aforementioned increases the Opposition believes should not have been given: schools, roads or pensions. The Opposition is understandably keen to remind us of the 1980s because that period was the last time their parties were returned to Government following a general election. At that time inflation was approximately 21% and personal tax rates were 40% and 65%. In 1986, the year before Fianna Fáil came back into Government, Ireland had a higher debt per head than Ethiopia and Sudan. We can never go back to the 1980s and I am confident that with Fianna Fáil at the helm we will not. The Taoiseach has come in for much criticism from the Opposition in recent weeks and the budgets over which he presided have been held up for scrutiny. I do not think there is anything to be ashamed of in the budgets of Deputy Cowen as Minister for Finance or in the budget of the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The old age pension was increased by €66, financial support for parents with children aged under six almost doubled, provision for special needs education was doubled and the social welfare budget increased by 40%. These are the vulnerable groups in society and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, looked after them when we were experiencing better times. Would the Opposition prefer we had neglected them? Its members accuse this Government of reckless spending but at the same time they continually call across the floor of this Chamber for more spending. This is the same Opposition that called for 13 further quangos at the last election. In its manifesto last year it called for three further junior Ministers. There appears to be a considerable level of confusion on the other side of the House. However, it is time all elected representatives pulled together. There has been too much finger pointing of late by the Opposition and it would be much more productive if all parties in this House got behind the Government in a joint effort to steer our economy through these more difficult times. That would benefit all of us. Framing a budget is not a popularity contest and nobody likes to impose stricter budgetary controls but we are not in the business of buying short-term popularity to put at risk all the gains of the last decade.",Lenihan

"The report by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, indicates that advisers to the Department from Merrill Lynch explicitly envisaged the exclusion of dated subordinated debt from the coverage of the guarantee. However, the two main banks requested that subordinated debt be included in the guarantee. Why, when advisers indicated to the Department that dated subordinated debt should be excluded, did the Department decide to accede to the request by the two main banks? Professor Honohan’s report states that notes were extremely sketchy at the time the bank guarantee was introduced. Will the Minister elaborate on the contradiction between the advice given by Merrill Lynch and the advice the Government eventually took? Will he make the Merrill Lynch report available to the House?",Lynch
"No, I am not. I am not spinning it at all. In fact, I have not discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan at all yet, in any detail, so there could not be any open warfare between the two of us. My job is to provide the report for Government and then let it take a decision on when or if any fees or a combination of loans and fees should be introduced. I have personal views and have expressed those quite openly. I believe there should be a contribution from the students and I am delighted that Deputy Hayes’ party is in agreement. I thank him for his document which is helpful in looking at the overall issue.",Lenihan

"I move:  I wish to share time with Deputy Ó Snodaigh. Seamus Brennan was one of the most respected and admired members of this House, who served with distinction in a wide range of portfolios at both senior and junior ministerial level. He was the subject of exceptionally warm and genuinely expressed tributes from all sides of the House following his death. However, it is seven months since Mr. Brennan’s death and it is long past the time the by-election should have been held. The normal procedure is that the party which held the seat where the vacancy has occurred gets the opportunity to move the writ. I had expected that Fianna Fáil would move the writ when the Dáil resumed after the summer recess. That would have allowed the by-election to be held towards the end of October. The Labour Party held off from moving the writ to give Fianna Fáil a reasonable opportunity to do so. I have, on several occasions, raised the matter of the by-election on the Order of Business with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and, on some occasions, my inquiry has been treated as some sort of a joke. The standard response I have received on each occasion has been that the matter had not yet been considered by the Government. It is time it was considered by the Government. I read in the newspapers that it is the Government’s intention to hold the by-election in conjunction with the local and European elections that will be held in early June. If the Government gets its way, it will mean the seat will have been left vacant for almost a year, which is not acceptable. There is no justification for leaving the seat vacant for such a long time. In Britain by-elections are held within a matter of weeks of the vacancy occurring in the House of Commons. The practice in the early decades of Dáil Éireann was to hold by-elections within a few weeks. For example, in 1927 the then justice Minister, Kevin O’Higgins, was assassinated on 10 July but the consequent by-election was held on 24 August. Even in recent decades normal practice has been that a by-election is held within a few months of the vacancy [231]occurring. Two vacancies occurred during the lifetime of the last Dáil and the by-elections were held within approximately three months. John Bruton and Charlie McCreevy both resigned as Deputies in November 2005, and the writs for the by-elections in Meath and Kildare North were moved in the Dáil by the Government Chief Whip on 15 February 2006. During the 28th Dáil, which sat between 1997 and 2002, there were six vacancies. On no occasion was the by election deferred for as long as a year. In the case of Theresa Ahern, the by-election was held within eight months. The other vacancies in the lifetime of that Dáil were Michael Ferris, two months Pat Upton, eight months Hugh Coveney, six months Ray Burke, four months and Jim Kemmy, five months. The pattern is similar for the 27th Dáil. The by-election following the death of Brian Lenihan senior was held within four months. In the case of Neil Blayney it was also four months Johnny Fox, three months and Pat Cox, three months. When the Labour Deputy for Cork North-Central, Gerry O’Sullivan, died in October 1994, the by-election was held within a month. One must to go back to the early 1990s to find a by-election postponed for more than a year. The people of Dublin South are entitled to the full level of representation in the Dáil provided for under the Constitution. The Constituency Commission has determined that the people of Dublin South should be represented by five Deputies. It is not acceptable that the Government should deny them that level of representation to which they are entitled by refusing to hold the by-election. Furthermore, if the Government believes it has the confidence of the people regarding its performance in office so far and particularly in regard to its handling of the economy, then surely it should put this to the test by holding the Dublin South by-election as early as possible. I anticipate the argument from the Government along the lines that the last thing the country needs at this difficult economic times is a by-election. The fact that the country is experiencing serious economic difficulties is no reason to suspend normal democratic procedures. By-elections have been held previously during times of economic difficulty. Even during the period of the Emergency, while a number of by-elections were deferred, others went ahead. By postponing the by-election for such a long period, the Government is suggesting Deputies do not matter, elections do not matter and democracy does not matter. That is the wrong message to send out at this or any other time. We all know the reason the Government parties are reluctant to have the by-election in Dublin South. They fear the judgment of the people on a Government that has led this country into an unprecedented economic crisis, that has presided over a record increase in the numbers out of work and that has danced to the tune of the bankers and developers. The prospect of a politically embarrassing result for Fianna Fáil and the Green Party is not sufficient justification for depriving the people of Dublin South of their full level of representation. I take with a grain of salt commitments that the Government parties want the by-election to be held on the same day as the local and European elections. I suspect they would like this by-election to be deferred indefinitely. I am sure that as June approaches other reasons will be put forward as to why it should be deferred further. It should not be possible for a Government to use its majority in this House to prevent a by-election being held. It is time to consider an amendment to Standing Orders to provide that where a vacancy occurs in the membership of the House, a writ would automatically issue after a specified period, say three or four months, unless a motion is passed that the writ be issued at an earlier date. This is an important motion. The way each Deputy votes on it will be an indication of the extent to which he or she values and respects our political process and our democratic system.",Ahern
"I do not know how many pools in which the Minister for Finance fishes but I am sure after recent weeks, he would prefer if the Tánaiste kept all her comments to herself in that they seem to be endlessly unhelpful to him and the Taoiseach. I would like to reflect on some of the points made by the many speakers who contributed to the debate, which was a very good one. We do not often have good debates in this House but this was a very interesting one. Deputy Frank Feighan suggested that all appointments should be advertised. That is not in the Bill but is something with which I very much agree. He also pointed out the extent to which Ministers will not answer parliamentary questions or say they are not responsible for the Health Service Executive or the National Roads Authority and yet they are the first to cut the ribbon to open a new hospital wing or a new motorway. That shows the hypocrisy of the way Government works in this country, that when asked to assist somebody, Ministers are not responsible but if it comes to a photo shoot or taking credit for something, they are the first people lining up. Deputy Andrew Doyle spoke about the extent to which the change in the HSE has undermined services — first centralising, then decentralising and then centralising again. Deputy David Stanton pointed out the extent to which parliamentary questions are not answered and when they are answered, it is by way of private correspondence between the agency and the Deputy and therefore, it does not go on the public record. That, in itself, reduces accountability. That is a point I had not considered but it is valid. Deputy James Bannon focused on the fact so much power is now vested in people who are not elected. The Government’s continuing decision to denude local government of power and to set up new agencies has very much continued that process. I refer to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh’s, response. He gave five reasons for not supporting this Bill. The first was his concern about chief executive officers being subjected to vetting by Oireachtas committees as it cuts across normal corporate governance arguments for boards to appoint chief executive officers. I take a very different view. The successor to Professor Brendan Drumm should come before this House. His appointment should be preliminary and we should interview him. The same should apply to the new governor of the Central Bank, which is a good appointment, but it would be appropriate for him to meet and testify before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service prior to his appointment. If the Government has such concern about that provision, there is no reason it cannot support the Bill and delete that section on Committee Stage. [118]The Minister of State indicated that he did not believe there was anything wrong with the current system. He said Ministers can be questioned and held responsible to the Houses of Oireachtas to justify their appointments. However, that is not the case. They can only be held accountable after the fact when the appointment has already been made, and therein lies the problem. The Minister of State and a number of other speakers, including Deputies Seán Ardagh and Michael Ahern, suggested that candidates may be discouraged by the prospect of presenting their credentials in a public forum before a committee. That is nonsense. Those who want to be, or who believe they are competent to be, chairmen of State agencies should have no hesitation coming before an Oireachtas committee to make their case. They are called to do so subsequent to their appointment so why should they not be called to do so prior to, or on, their appointment? We could learn much about the kind of people put in charge of State agencies if we did this. When the chairman of the Labour Relations Commission, the chairman of the Labour Court and so on have appeared before committees, I have asked them if they would be prepared to do this. They have said they would welcome it and that they would have no difficulty doing so. They said they would feel they had more authority having received the approval of the Oireachtas and not only the Minister. I do not know who is afraid. Is it the potential candidates or, for some reason, Ministers who want to cover up some of the appointments they have made which are most inappropriate? Another argument the Minister of State made was that there would be a total overload for Oireachtas committees. That is nonsense. Most of what Oireachtas committees do is not relevant. They should be given a more relevant role beyond select committees and this is one area where this should be done. The Minister of State and other speakers pointed out that there have been some initiatives, including the Minister for Transport advertising positions on the Dublin Transport Authority and the moves by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in regard to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. They are only two agencies out of 1,000 and in those cases, it is only advertising the appointments. In the case of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the Minister intends to appoint half the members which is exactly the way it is done currently with no transparency whatsoever. That is very little progress. Interestingly, of the other Government speakers, very few spoke substantially against the Bill. Deputy Mary O’Rourke spoke largely in favour it. She supported the provisions in it with the exception of the chief executive officer provision and spoke about her role as a Senator in proposing that the Seanad should have this sort of role. Similarly, the principle was accepted by Deputies Seán Ardagh and Michael Ahern, except for the chief executive officer section. What was most strange was the contribution of the Green Party. In contrast to his Fianna Fáil colleagues, Deputy Ciarán Cuffe said the Bill did not go far enough and that it is limited in its ambitions. That is a totally contrary view to that of Fianna Fáil. He said it did not apply to enough bodies and nor did it provide for enough diversity. Deputy Mary White claimed the Bill did not go far enough. In contrast to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, she supported explicitly the principle of Oireachtas ratification of public appointments and that Oireachtas committees should review them. She also said overseas appointments should be confirmed by the Dáil, an approach which the Minister for Finance regards as unprecedented, except in the case of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Again, one wonders how long this coalition will last when the Government parties [119]are united in opposition to a Bill but for divergent and contradictory reasons. This is a bizarre Government. I thank the Labour Party, particularly Deputy Higgins, for his contribution. I took on board his points about the flaws of corporate governance in, and the bad example set by, private sector boards. We should not think that in trying to change how public sector boards are appointed what goes on in the private sector should be honoured or followed. Deputy Creighton summed up the essential thrust of the Bill. Fine Gael believes public appointments should be public, public bodies should be accountable and government should be transparent. Any Member who shares these views should have no hesitation in supporting this Bill. Question put. The Dáil divided: Tá, 66 Níl, 70. Tellers: Tá, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg Níl, Deputies Pat Carey and John Cregan. Question declared lost.",Carey
"It is always a great honour for me to participate in the commissioning ceremony for new officers of our Defence Forces. This was particularly so on the 19th of June at Casement Aerodrome where two ceremonies were held, commencing with the Commissioning of the 26th Air Corps Cadet Class which was followed by the Presentation of the Distinguished Service Medal, with Honour, posthumously to the crew members of the Dauphin DH 248 who lost their lives on the night of 1st July 1999 while returning from a successful rescue mission. Both ceremonies were attended by members of the immediate family and friends of the new officers and the medal recipients as well as a number of distinguished guests, including the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Lieutenant General Dermot Earley, and the General Secretary of the Department of Defence, Michael Howard, along with public representatives and a wide cross-section of other interested parties. In speaking at the commissioning ceremony I reflected on the special commitment that these eight new officers were making in choosing a career of service to their country that will call for courage, commitment and professionalism as their guiding light. I also recognised the proud record of service to the nation that has been given over the years by the Air Corps and its pilots. I outlined the ongoing investment programme in the Air Corps, both in aircraft and facilities, which ensures a bright future for the Air Corps. In the second ceremony on the day, we remembered the sacrifice of the four members of the Air Corps arising from the tragic accident that occurred in Tramore, Co. Waterford on 1 July 1999. [527]The four crew members who lost their lives that night were: Captain David O’Flaherty Captain Michael Baker Sergeant Patrick Mooney Corporal Niall Byrne. Having considered the events of the night, a military board recommended to me that the Distinguished Service Medal, with Honour, be awarded posthumously to the four men. I had no hesitation in accepting the recommendation of the board. My only regret being the length of time that it had taken to reach this conclusion. While I understood that coming to the ceremony in Casement Aerodrome evoked very sad memories for the members of the O’Flaherty, Baker, Mooney and Byrne families in attendance, and for all the members of their families and friends, who lost their loved one so suddenly in such a tragic accident, I expressed the hope that they might take some consolation from the honour that was being accorded to the memory of these four brave young men. I presented a Distinguished Service Medal, with Honour, to: Mr. Vincent and Mrs Anna Byrne parents of the late Corporal Byrne Mrs Monica Mooney, widow of the late Sgt Mooney and Miss Davina O’Flatherty, daughter of the late Captain O’Flaherty. It is hoped that separate arrangements can be made in the near future to present the Distinguished Service Medal to the parents of the late Capt Baker.",Byrne
"With regard to the first matter raised, it is hoped at this point that this legislation could come to the House next Thursday for Report Stage at least and hopefully for its finalisation. On the second matter, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, has advanced a great deal of work in this area which we hope will come to Government soon, possibly before Christmas. We may then have to come back and talk to people who have put forward other wording for discussion. I do not know what the process may be but the work of the Minister of State is being advanced. Budget day will be the day on which, based on the budget announcements, we can outline what legislative enactments are necessary to implement that budget and what period may be regarded as appropriate for its preparation and proper enactment.",Andrews
"I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak today in support of the Government’s amendment to the motion. There is no doubt that we have made significant progress in recent years in investing in the education of young people with special needs and educational difficulties. As a country, we will probably never reach the stage where we can say we have done absolutely everything we can and provided every single resource possible for people with learning difficulties. However, we must always strive to provide every resource that our means will allow and introduce the best educational policies possible. [18]Disability is extremely diverse and a one size to fit all approach does not apply. In recent years the Government’s investment in special needs education has increased dramatically and this year alone, the budget for special needs will exceed €1 billion. This is a doubling of the level of investment in special needs education just five years ago. The range of resources being provided to special needs education has also expanded greatly over recent years and important supports, such as the resource teaching support, special needs assistants, special transport arrangements and increased capital funding for the purchase of special equipment, are now available to allow schools meet the requirements of pupils with educational needs, allowing these children to access a level of education appropriate to their needs. There are now in excess of 8,000 learning support and resource teacher posts in primary and secondary schools and these provide additional support to pupils with learning difficulties. When the Government entered office in 1997, there were only 2,000 such positions in the country. The Minister, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, and his predecessors have overseen a significant increase in the number of posts available. In addition, there are now more than 10,000 special needs assistants in our schools. An increase of 33% in funding in 2009 will allow for the recruitment of up to 50 extra psychologists under the National Education Psychological Service. This debate centres on whether we should aim to integrate pupils with mild learning difficulties into mainstream classes and provide them with the most inclusive educational and social experience possible. It is widely accepted in educational fields internationally that integrating children with mild learning disabilities with others in their age group and allowing them to have a fully inclusive educational experience is the most desirable approach for a society to take. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities agrees with this approach and advocates that children with mild learning disabilities should be integrated into the mainstream education system. The European Union, in a resolution adopted in 1990, also believes that full integration should be considered as a first option wherever possible. Many of our European partners take this approach in their education systems. Integrating children with mild learning difficulties into an inclusive educational system does not just revolve around meeting their educational needs, it is also about giving them a place in society and giving them confidence among their peers. Segregating people with any form of disability, including learning difficulties, isolates them from society. In a school system, removing these children from mainstream education marks them out as different from their peers and creates a barrier that extends far beyond the school yard. I had my accident during the summer holidays between first and second year in secondary school. As a result, I missed nine months of second year. One of the most important decisions my parents and the principal of my school in New Ross made at the time was to allow me to continue my education with my classmates. If I had been held back a year, I would not have been happy. The last thing I would have wanted would have been to be placed in a special needs class. I did not have special needs assistants and I did not require them.",O'Keeffe
"I do not propose to give further details of the case because the Minister has received a copy of the letter. I hope his officials are listening and will address the anomalies raised in the correspondence. It is not fair that a person issued with a work permit from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment may bring his or her family to Ireland, whereas an Irish citizen may not bring his partner and child into the country. Although it is legally possible for the child to enter the country, obviously children do not travel without a parent. European immigration has been highly successful and many people from the new EU accession states have made a significant contribution to society. We have all benefited from their contribution to our economic, social and cultural life. Without their input into the construction, service and higher end IT and value added industries, it is unlikely the Celtic tiger would have purred along so successfully. The citizens of the new EU accession states who have set up home here, including Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Lithuanians and Estonians, are owed a great deal of credit and gratitude for the important role they have played. I recently met the Polish ambassador at the opening of an important photographic exhibition in Bishopstown, County Cork. He informed me that in recent years 1. 5 million Poles have spread out across Europe in search of work, experience and skills. The Poles, of whom there are upwards of 250,000 in Ireland, including a large community in Cork, are welcome because they are hard working, polite and respectful. While the ambassador accepted that his compatriots had made a significant contribution to the countries to which they had moved, he asked the Polish people assembled in the beautiful new library in Bishopstown, which is located next to the Tesco store, to return home to apply the skills and experience they have acquired and invest the money they have earned. He accepted, however, that many of them must remain outside Poland for a further short period to make money. [335]Ireland has experienced immigration much later than most of our European neighbours and is in a good position to learn from their mistakes, as we are doing. It is vital, as we move forward, that immigration is accompanied by policies which will ensure that integration takes place. We have, for the first time, appointed a Minister of State with specific responsibility for integration, Deputy Conor Lenihan. Approximately 40,000 immigrant children from a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures attend Irish schools. To ensure they do not lag behind their Irish counterparts, we have recruited almost 1,900 language support teachers to meet the needs of children whose first language is not English. In some cases, the mothers of these children cannot speak English and are unable to help with their school work. The roll-out of adult education classes is also vital if integration is to proceed. More than 12,000 places have been taken up by migrants learning English in classes provided by the national network of 33 vocational education committees. We have read much in recent press reports about the exploitation of migrants. I am pleased the law is being changed to provide that green cards and work permits will be issued to employees as opposed to employers. A key aspect of changes in the new legislation being rolled out is that permits will not be issued for jobs paying below the national minimum wage. I welcome the introduction of hefty fines and more serious consequences for employers who take advantage of migrant workers who work hard alongside Irish people. A number of communities are experiencing difficulties with integration. I will give the House a flavour of the types of integration problems outlined to my Fianna Fáil Party colleagues and me by representatives of the Polish community at our meeting last Saturday. Other immigrant communities may be experiencing similar problems. Those who run mycork. org, a website for Polish immigrants, informed us that Polish is taught for a number of hours every week in St. Patrick’s school in the city. Polish migrants favour more integration and while they do not want separate schools, they seek greater assistance from the authorities for teaching Polish, mathematics and other subjects that are taught differently on the Polish curriculum. Many Polish parents intend to return home with their children. The group indicated it had not made contact with State authorities on this matter or other matters. Perhaps it did not know how to access the authorities and it may have been unaware of what services are available. From the note I received, I understand 1,000 Polish children and parents are involved in the classes at St. Patrick’s school, which are recognised by the Ministry for Education in Poland. The Minister for Education and Science should examine what services are available for the various language communities to enable them to continue to study their national curriculum alongside English and Irish. Sylvia Adamska, a migrant officer from the west Cork community partnership who works with Poles and other immigrants in Bantry and Clonakilty, emphasised the importance of the project and asked for assistance for its activities. I understand funding for the project will finish in March 2008. She has written to the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and I hope further funding will be made available. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin, and other Ministers were present at the meeting, which was a briefing for Fianna Fáil Members and councillors. I have no doubt the other parties will receive similar briefings. I was astonished to hear about impoliteness from officials in the social welfare service and the tax office, particularly where Polish people who had no knowledge of the English language were treated unpleasantly. This was also mentioned by a lady who acts as a translator for people dealing with State agencies and assisting Poles in accessing information or benefits to which they are entitled. [336]In the 16 years I have been in public life I have not heard a bad word about an official in any Department. They are always extremely polite and helpful. I raised this matter on Saturday, stating if this is true it is first time I have experienced it. Perhaps we will speak with people in State agencies and bodies to see whether we should provide Polish interpreters or Polish workers in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to deal with the number of people who wish to access the services. Provision of official migrant workers’ rights and entitlements in the Polish language was also requested. This would be helpful in raising awareness and self-confidence among migrants. A particular need exists for information on employment rights, taxes, working conditions and anti-discrimination legislation, which we recently introduced. The matter of English classes was also raised. Another issue raised was the exploitation of migrant workers, which generally takes the form of underpayment of wages or non-payment of entitlements or overtime. The vast majority of employers pay immigrant workers from EU states the rate they should be paid and are not exploiting them. I must state some are unscrupulous and abuse EU and other nationals who do not understand the language and cannot find out about their rights. This is neither fair nor right. I hope our enforcement officers will deal with this, and I believe they are doing so. This is a flavour of the difficulties experienced by one community. I am sure it is the same for other communities. The Government and local agencies must do more to integrate such people into our society.",Lenihan
"The two-day Dáil sitting this week has been devoted exclusively to these statements on the macro-economic and fiscal outlook. I must ask why this is happening. We have been provided with none of the critical budgetary data and the Government has not provided any indication of the approach it intends to take to the budget, so why is it happening? The only explanation that makes any sense is that it is part of the cynical political game the Government is playing to try to suck in all political parties and to somehow spread the blame for the catastrophic mess it has created. It desperately tries to choreograph the scenario which implicates all political parties in some kind of phoney consensus to hatch a secret plan to somehow sort out the budget problems, not just for this year but for the next four years. The Labour Party is having none of that. Fianna Fáil created this problem through its reckless mismanagement of the economy over the past decade. It has wrecked people’s lives and burdened the people with massive debts which will be with us for at least a generation. The Labour Party will not bail out the Government. It is time for the Government to do the decent thing and to get out and give others a chance to put things right. The people who caused this recession are incapable of bringing about a recovery. The Government does not have the authority or the ability to pass a budget this year, let alone to produce a four-year plan. The members of the Government have no mandate for a four-year plan. They will not be in government to implement such a plan and they should do the patriotic thing now and go to the country. For everyone’s sake, they should allow a new Government with a fresh mandate to bring about recovery. The prevailing feeling among the public now is fear — fear for their jobs, their homes, the welfare of their families and about what the Government will do to them in the budget in December. That fear is a self-fulfilling prophecy as it stops people from living any kind of normal life, stops them spending and destroys consumer confidence. Of course, the mishandling of the economy and the ruinous bank bailout have destroyed confidence in the money markets also. We are asked to participate in this debate yet there has been a marked information deficit when it comes to the Government providing accurate data. It seeks the Opposition’s support yet it refuses to provide the basic economic information to accurately assess the current situation. It was interesting to listen to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, earlier. He had a wholly different rationale for the kind of figures that are being tossed about at present. It is the first time we have heard that type of rationale or explanation as to why the deficit has suddenly jumped from €7. 5 billion to €15 billion. Is that rationale shared by anybody else at the Cabinet table because today is the first time we have heard it? There is no indication that the Government will consider an open budgetary process as suggested by Deputy Rabbitte. It seems intent on refusing to discuss the situation in an honest and open manner. When one considers the contribution made by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, yesterday, he seemed far more interested in knocking any proposals coming from either the Labour Party or anybody else on the Opposition benches than in listening in any kind of constructive manner to the proposals and suggestions being made. This would seem to be what the game is about as far as the Government is concerned — it is about sucking in the Opposition parties and then knocking them. All of the Government’s forecasts to date have turned out to be very wide of the mark. There is no reason whatsoever to think it is any more competent or honest about it now. [381]Another point concerns the approach due to be taken in the budget. I always worry when I hear Ministers say their priority is to protect the vulnerable because I know from bitter experience they will actually do the opposite. The coded language which they regularly use, such as 'We are all in this together' or 'Everyone must share the burden', inevitably means that those on low and modest incomes will take the brunt of the cuts. Fianna Fáil has always looked after the privileged and protected the golden circle. It does this in good times and it will undoubtedly do it in bad times too. In approaching this budget, not only is there a major hole in the public finances due to the mismanagement of the economy over the past decade but there is a major millstone around our necks with a €1. 5 billion interest bill to be met as a result of the bank guarantee every year for up to 15 years. We know that bridging that gap will be crippling but front-loading the adjustment to the extent suggested by some Government spokespersons is simply not sustainable. The argument is that we must convince the markets we are serious when we go back to borrowing in January. However, it can hardly be seen as serious or credible to seek cuts that are so severe they are utterly deflationary and destroy all prospect of growth. What if front-loading does not work? Will the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, be coming back and talking about a €30 billion adjustment next year? He has been wrong so often before. What if he is completely wrong on this occasion too? The truth is that the ratings agencies and the bond markets expect to see a viable plan which is capable of leading this country to recovery. Critical to this is that growth is achieved. They need to see that our economy is viable and what they need to see most in order to create confidence is that there is a competent political leadership in the country. The Labour Party believes that an even mix of spending cuts and taxation measures is required in order to balance the key objectives of achieving growth, protecting employment and reducing the deficit. It concerns me greatly to hear the Ministers talk about cutting welfare rates and taxing the working poor. Not only would it be completely unjust to target those on the lowest levels of income, it would make no economic sense whatsoever. People on low incomes have no choice but to spend their money because they cannot afford to save. Cutting their incomes means depressing consumer spending even further and we simply cannot afford that. It is very telling that the Government has not ruled out cutting the State pension yet it shows no appetite at all for tackling the obscenely generous pension tax breaks for the wealthy. How can the Government defend circumstances in which the best off in society can put away pension funds of €5. 4 million and, on retirement, take out €1. 3 million in a lump sum and pay no tax whatsoever thereon. That this was ever allowed to happen is a scandal. That the Government allows it to continue in the current economic circumstances is completely indefensible, yet neither the Minister for Finance nor his colleagues has ever mentioned this sweetheart arrangement for the wealthy. The Government spends approximately €3 billion on pension tax reliefs, the vast bulk of which apply to the top 20% of earners. This seems to be a very well-kept secret. Strangely, the Revenue Commissioners do not even collect data on it. Incredibly, the Department of Finance denies any knowledge at all of the costs involved. I have been looking for some of the costs for the past three years. The Department does not collect data. In the most recent reply I received last week to a parliamentary question on this subject, I was told, incredibly, that the Department is to approach the pensions industry to see whether it can put a rough figure on the cost to the State of these generous tax reliefs. There is a wide range of other tax breaks, all designed to assist the wealthy in avoiding their responsibility to pay tax. There are 126,000 people in Ireland earning salaries in excess of €100,000. Why do we hear nothing from any of the Ministers on the need to implement a fair [382]taxation system such that we can target the serious wealth that still exists in this country in order to achieve fairness in the approach to bridging the budget gap? Unfortunately, we only hear about tackling people on low incomes and hitting them yet again. We know what the Government is and that it has always been a supporter of the wealthiest. It has no moral authority to introduce a budget this year or in any of the coming years. The only solution is for it to do the decent thing, go to the country and allow the public to decide.",Lenihan
"I was looking for a copy of the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.",Carey
"I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 and 270 together. The Government continues to attach the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States. The former Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern T. D., strongly emphasised this commitment during his address to the US Congress on 30 April. During the visit of the former Taoiseach to Washington, my predecessor, Mr Dermot Ahern T. D., participated in his meetings with President Bush, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Edward Kennedy. On 1 May, Minister Ahern had a further series of meetings with key Congressional and Administration figures to press the case for finding a solution for our undocumented. Among those he met were: Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, Chair of the House Sub-Committee on Immigration Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Congressman Jim Walsh and Ms Paula Dobriansky, Under-Secretary of State and Special Envoy to Northern Ireland. My predecessor also had a constructive and forward looking meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I look forward to working closely with ILIR on this important issue. Following the failure of the US Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation last June, despite the strong endorsement and encouragement of President Bush, the Government immediately set about exploring with key US Administration and Congressional contacts possible alternative options. However, achieving progress on immigration reform at this time, in the middle of a Presidential campaign, is exceptionally difficult. The political reality in the United States is that immigration has become a divisive political issue. Our many friends in Congress have emphasised this, including the difficulty of passing legislation specifically for our citizens separate from the other 12 million undocumented. [165]Despite these considerable political challenges, the Government will continue to press for change. We will work closely with our friends in Congress, with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, and with the many organisations who have worked hard on behalf of the undocumented in the Irish community, with a view to trying to find a way forward which would remedy the very difficult situation in which our undocumented find themselves.",Ahern
"I commend the Labour Party and Deputy Ciarán Lynch for bringing this Bill before the House this evening and I compliment Retail Excellence Ireland on bringing this matter to the attention of the public. The chief executive of Ennis Chamber of Commerce, Ms Rita McInerney, informed me today that 70 commercial properties are available at present to [446]buy or rent in Ennis. Some 700 businesses are on the rates books of Ennis Town Council. It is a frightening reality that 10% of the rateable commercial properties in Ennis are vacant, unoccupied or have had to close down because of the recession. Unfortunately, this scenario is replicated throughout the country. It is blatantly clear that commercial retail rents in Ireland cannot be sustained in the current trading environment. Many of these rent agreements were struck during the height of the economic boom experienced in this country and bear no resemblance to the economic reality faced by our country. The regime of upward-only rents has resulted in many of our retailers, who were hanging on by their fingertips, going to the wall and bringing valuable jobs with them. I have spoken to many Clare business people who are struggling due to the unsustainable leases into which they are tied. They are crying out for some respite or a helping hand. There were 38 retail insolvency cases in Ireland in the first two months of 2010. The retail sector in this country is in crisis and that must stop. It is a profoundly depressing experience to walk down any street in any city or town in this country and witness as commonplace whited-out windows and the ever growing proliferation of 'To Rent' signs. In the past fortnight, the significance of what is happening to smaller shops with the loss of four, five or six jobs on a daily basis was underlined by the closing down of two signature retail outlets, namely, the bookseller Hughes & Hughes and Bestseller, the renowned clothing chain which has gone into examinership. Both these retailers blamed excessive rents for their difficulties. Rents charges on properties are now exceeding labour costs. It is commonplace to find retailer’s rents representing up to 20% of their revenue. This position is causing great financial stress to businesses and it is simply unsustainable. It is somewhat ironic that, little by little, we are seeing some of those involved in our now discredited banking sector beginning to appear as landlords of buildings and shopping centres. Just as we must know what took place in our banking institutions, we must also know what is going on in the rental market. There must be full transparency in the process, which is not the case at present. The whole industry requires proper regulation and full disclosure. In short, there must be a level playing field for all parties engaged in the process. It is obvious to all that the retail sector has taken its fair share of cuts. Retailers have cut the prices charged to consumers and cut labour costs by letting people go or reducing hours. However, in the case of the most significant cost, that is, rent, nothing can be changed. There is price flexibility in all walks of business life. We see it in sales, special offers for products, discounts for bulk purchasing and promotions. Without this flexibility the business world would simply not exist. The only area in business where there is no flexibility is in respect of rents. This evening, the Government has an opportunity to introduce a retrospective ban on upward-only rents. This ban will go some way towards stopping the loss of vital retail jobs. It will give much needed support to small and medium-sized businesses which provide these jobs. I urge the backbenchers in Fianna Fáil to stand up and represent the people who put them in here and to stand up for the small and medium-sized businesses that provide the jobs that people are crying out for. I am sick and tired of watching the shedding of crocodile tears by Deputies moaning about job losses. Tonight, they have an opportunity to stand by their people and the retail sector of this country by supporting this Bill. I appeal especially to the backbenchers in this regard.",Lynch

"In any event, Deputy Lynch wishes to reply.",Lynch
"This is a disastrous budget. It is an anti-people, anti-democratic budget, which is clearly the product of a sell-out of Irish sovereignty to the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank. It is an effort by a totally discredited Government with no mandate and in its dying days to impose a Thatcherite economic strategy on the people. The result of this cruel strategy will be to heap even more poverty, unemployment and social misery on our people. It is an attack on the mass of people who are on low to middle incomes, with those most vulnerable to be injured most. The wealthy are to escape yet again. All of this has been done to bail out bank bondholders and do the bidding of the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund. The basis of the budget, IMF-EU deal and four year plan is the belief that taking €15 billion out of the economy between now and 2015 will bring us out of recession. By the Taoiseach’s own admission, €15 billion has been taken out of the economy since 2008. With what result? If there is growth in the economy, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, claimed in his Budget Statement, the budget will stem it and suck the oxygen out of the economy. The recession is not over but continuing and deepening. For month after month, we have consistently had more than 400,000 people unemployed. There was nothing in the budget to sustain existing jobs, not to speak of creating new jobs, because the Government does not have an employment strategy. In desperation it tries to portray any marginal reduction in the live register figures as a sign of recovery when such reductions reflect the growing numbers of young people taking the option of leaving the country for opportunities overseas. In his Budget Statement last December, the Minister for Finance stated we were on the road to economic recovery. 'The worst is over', he declared, adding that 'we are turning the corner'. In his speech introducing the 2011 budget, the Minister spoke of 'clear signs of hope' and 'returning to growth after a deep and prolonged recession'. His words are even less credible this year than they were in December 2009. In his budget speech the Minister served up a large dollop of historical revisionism. With a straight face, he stated that the €19 billion budget deficit was created because the Government, during the boom, was 'seeking, with the full support of those opposite, to spread the benefits of the boom across every section of the population'. The reality was that the Government refused to spread the benefits of the boom across society and refused to share the wealth. Sinn [459]Féin stood alone among the parties in this House in arguing against any reduction in tax levels or bands in a succession of general elections, including in 2007. The Minister stated, 'households and businesses continue to work off the excesses of the boom'. This is to suggest that every household grew fat during the boom or, as the Minister stated last week, we all 'partied'. That is a parody of the truth and an insult to thousands of households which are struggling to make ends meet and survive week on week, even before yesterday’s budgetary measures take effect. Last year, I described as reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher the Minister’s argument that the social welfare system can trap people in joblessness. The only thing trapping people in joblessness is this Government, which has wrecked the economy and failed to present a strategy to create real jobs and sustain existing employment. At that time, I also warned that, after the attacks on people on social welfare and low income in budget 2010, the minimum wage would be next in line. That is precisely what occurred 12 months later. My prediction came to pass in this budget, which launched a further all out attack on people dependent on social welfare, with the slashing of the minimum wage scheduled to follow in March. The result of this cruel budget will be poverty, unemployment and social misery. The cuts to social welfare are savage — there is no other way to describe them. They are absolutely savage and it is people on social welfare who will bear the brunt of this budget. The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, tried to justify these cuts by claiming there was low inflation. That was a pathetic effort to defend the indefensible. The very budget that cuts social welfare also raises a whole range of costs that will be borne by people on social welfare and other low to middle income families. According to the consumer price index, prices rose by 2% in 2010. The real effect is that the basic social welfare rate is being cut by €416 per annum. A couple dependent on social welfare will be down €691 per annum. When child benefit cuts are added an unemployed family with three children will be down over €1,000 in actual cash available to meet the family’s needs each year. Most social welfare recipients will have €8 per week, or €416 per year, taken out of their pockets by this budget. Jobseeker’s allowance has been reduced by €8 to €188 per week for those aged over 25. For people between 22 and 25 years of age the rate drops by €6 per week to €144. In a budget with no jobs strategy the Government’s message to the unemployed, especially the young unemployed, is very clear — subsist on less or emigrate. That is the message this Government is delivering to the young people of Ireland today. In budget 2010 the Government’s cruellest cut was to carers. People on carer’s allowance lost €8. 50 per week and those on carer’s benefit lost €8. 20. It is reckoned that more than 160,000 family carers provide over 3. 7 million hours of care each week. On top of the heartless cuts in 2010 budget 2011 now takes another €8 per week from the carer’s allowance and carer’s benefit, or a weekly cut of €16. 50 and €16. 20, respectively, in the space of just over a year. It is an absolute disgrace. This budget cannot be taken in isolation from the series of austerity budgets introduced by this Government during a period of almost three years The weekly €8 cut slashes the invalidity pension, one-parent family payment, disability allowance, widows’ and widowers’ pensions, disability pension and the blind pension. As Inclusion Ireland has pointed out, these cuts are completely at variance with the national disability strategy which is often cited by Government as evidence of its commitment to people with disabilities. This is an anti-children budget and undoubtedly will increase child poverty. The €10 reduction to child benefit for the first and second child, €20 for the third and another €10 for the fourth child will penalise poorer families most. That is obvious and is also shameless. As the European anti-poverty network has pointed out, statistics for 2009 released last week by the Central Statistics Office show that levels of consistent poverty in this State rose from 4. 2% in 2008 to 5. 5%, while the numbers unable to afford basic requirements went up by[460]25%. These figures reflect a situation even before the impact of the budget cuts of last year, let alone of the budget introduced yesterday, are taken into account. Let us make no mistake — the situation is very serious and the poverty trap is deepening. Cutting social welfare should be the last thing a Government does in a time of economic difficulty. Cutting social welfare payments will have a detrimental effect on the economy and society because those payments are always returned to the economy. They are not salted away in savings or invested overseas but are spent on rent, mortgages, food, utilities and all the other essentials people need in life’s daily requirements. Cutting welfare is a false economy, the only tangible result of which is misery for those on the receiving end. If less money is spent, the economy will contract, businesses will struggle and more jobs will be lost. More people will be reliant on social welfare. Local economies will suffer especially badly and communities struggling out of poverty and marginalisation will be pushed back. Last month a survey conducted by Sinn Féin with 278 social welfare recipients demonstrated that families on welfare simply cannot afford to take this hit. On the current welfare rates almost 90% of those surveyed will go without something essential this Christmas, be that food, home heating fuel or Christmas presents. Respondents also confirmed that more than half of welfare recipients may borrow money to see themselves through Christmas. Ultimately, the only stimulus in this budget is for loan sharks and money lenders. I stated that this is an anti-children budget and this is carried through into the cuts to education. Education has taken a disproportionate hit. I am glad that the leader of the Green Party, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is present. In times of recession education could and should be used as a tool for economic recovery. It should be the gateway to growth and revival. Of course, the Government’s approach is the exact opposite. Instead of investing in and growing the education sector this Government has reduced education spending year after year. It seems intent on making education a preserve of the rich. Gone are the days of free education, in are the days of under-funded schools and exorbitant fees. There is an overall reduction of 21% in capital expenditure for education in the coming year 9% for primary schools and a whopping 20% for secondary schools. This is inexcusable and makes a laughing stock of the Government’s claim to be building a knowledge economy. Children will continue to go to school in prefabs rented from private concerns at exorbitant long-term costs. Classes will be unable to cope with more children and less room. A Government with a sound education strategy and a job creation strategy would have invested in school buildings, creating much-needed employment in the construction sector and providing long-term upgrading of our educational infrastructure. The 5% cut in capitation funding for primary schools will penalise all schools but especially the most disadvantaged which depend more on Government funding. Schools are already struggling with high class sizes and limited resources. Children and families in rural Ireland will be worst affected by the new €50 primary school transport charge. Add to that the €50 increase in the secondary school transport fee to €350 per child per year and the impact on families with children is very substantial. In addition, rural farming families have been hit again with the €36 million reduction in the REP scheme. No-one can accuse the Government of lacking imagination or innovation in this budget. It has come up with another innovative barrier to education. Which member of Government was responsible for authoring a new €200 per annum fee for post leaving certificate courses? This anti-education Government has increased third-level registration fees by €500 to €2000 and has reduced student grants. It has cut grants to secondary schools by 9% and taken 3% from the vocational education sector. A cruel Government has again cut support for children with special educational needs. Sixty per cent is to be cut from educational disadvantage funding.",Lenihan
"I propose to take Questions Nos. 405 and 421 together.

The Children’s Acts Advisory Board was established in 2007. The Board has advised the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) on best practice and co-ordination in the special residential care sector, on both a formal and informal basis. In October 2008 a decision was made by Government to subsume the functions of the Children’s Acts Advisory Board (CAAB) into the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. This is provided for under the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009, which recently passed Committee stage in Dáil Eireann. The Bill is due to complete its passage through the Oireachtas shortly.",O'Sullivan
"I wish to share time with Deputy Thomas Byrne, with the permission of the House. I, too, am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill and I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the speed in which the legislation has been drafted and for his determination to have it enacted as quickly as possible. This is one of a number of Bills dealing with our response to organised crime that have come before the House this year. We have also had a number of Private Members’ debates in recent months on the same topic. It is a sad reflection on society that we are in a position where organised crime has become such a focus of attention for the Oireachtas. A small number of gangs have contaminated inner city communities, particularly in Limerick and Dublin — they operate with impunity around the country — and view themselves as untouchable. Anyone [207]who saw the recent YouTube video uploaded by the leaders of one of the country’s most prominent criminal gangs will have been shocked by the blatant bravado shown by these criminals and the fact that they obviously think they are so far above the law that they can broadcast a two fingered salute to civilised society over the Internet. This House owes a duty to the local communities such people come from to remove them and their poisonous activities from the streets of Ireland. I support the previous speaker, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, regarding the comments made this morning by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. One sometimes wants to question what planet these people are on. I, too, worry about the civil liberties of the victims of crime, and those of the witnesses, the jurors, the gardaí and society in general. Those are the people we need to protect and that is what this legislation is primarily about. In researching for this debate I looked up a number of different articles and studied methods that were used in other countries. I will refer to a couple of them during my contribution. I recently read an interesting newspaper article about the growth of organised crime. The author said that crime 'uproots and destroys communities, deprives people of their livelihoods, takes young men away from their families and habituates them to violence'. The author was a Sudanese journalist named Muawad Mustafa Rashid. He was writing about crime in his own country and in the developing world generally, but his words could easily be applied to the situation that has developed in some of our inner city suburbs. The criminal gangs who are terrorising parts of our cities have led us to the situation where descriptions of a criminal culture in certain parts of the developing world are now interchangeable with what is happening in parts of Ireland. Mr. Rashid concluded his article by stating: 'crime prevention is inseparable from social development. Violence and crime are usually the result of inequality and poverty, and they certainly breed fastest in the society characterized by extremes of inequality and social exclusion.' Again, while he was discussing conditions in his own country, his words could equally apply to those areas in Ireland that have suffered most from a gang culture in recent years. He is right that crime and poverty are linked and that social exclusion provides a breeding ground for criminality. That is why as a society we need to take a 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime' approach and why I believe that initiatives such as the establishment of the Limerick regeneration agencies and the ongoing work of Ballymun Regeneration Limited are just as important in defeating a criminal culture as any criminal justice legislation we debate in this House. This raises a serious question about the type of society we aspire to, and we must examine our conscience in this regard and reflect on the part played by wider society. There is one significant difference between the criminal culture which Mr. Rashid describes in Sudan and the type of organised crime which has developed in Ireland in recent years. In developing countries, the middle classes do not fund the activities of criminals. Unfortunately in Ireland, the middle classes are among the main funders of these criminal gangs. We must look deep into our hearts at all levels of society in Ireland. They are either completely ignorant of the damage they are causing to many communities by their actions or they simply do not care because they do not have to look at this damage every day and live with its consequences. The reality is that every time a student takes an ecstasy tablet in a nightclub, a solicitor or an engineer picks up a line of cocaine on a Friday night or a doctor or nurse smokes a joint at a party, they are putting money into the pockets of these criminal gangs. They are financing their weapons buying trips and playing their part in the desecration of inner city communities. Until such time as the middle and upper classes in this country are willing to take responsibility for their actions, until the time comes when they accept that their selfish recreational weekend [208]drug use is the main source of income for these criminal gangs and that their drug use provided the money which paid for the weapons which killed Anthony Campbell, Brian Fitzgerald, Shane Geoghegan and Roy Collins, we will be fighting a constant battle against these gangs. Unfortunately, the recreational drug user does not have to wake up each morning and face the damage that is being inflicted on communities such as Ballinacurra and Moyross. He or she can feign shock and complete innocence when another innocent victim is gunned down. We should reflect on what is happening. People are losing their lives, families are being torn apart at the loss of sons, daughters, husbands, wives, mothers and fathers. We must look at the cost in human terms. I strongly welcome this Bill and I hope it is passed as soon as possible. In many ways there are not many new proposals in the Bill. We are taking much of the legislation we have successfully used to combat terrorism and fine-tuning it in the fight against organised crime. This initiative recognises that some of these gangs pose almost as big a threat to the well-being of the State as the various terrorist organisations did in previous decades. Terrorists and the criminals have many similar ways of operating. Both types of organisation make themselves overlords in marginalised communities, accept no opposition or criticism from the communities they come from, indoctrinate their members at an early age and view themselves as being above the law. It is fitting that similar laws should be used to combat similar organisations. I am very supportive of the proposals contained in this Bill which would allow many of the offences connected with organised crime to be regarded as scheduled offences and to be tried in the Special Criminal Court. The Special Criminal Court was one of the most effective weapons this State had to protect itself against terrorists in the past and I am glad that it will be now used against the latest threat to the security of the State, organised criminal gangs. One of the criticisms I have heard of this proposal is that there is no need to bring these crimes before the Special Criminal Court because there is no evidence that these gangs have been involved in jury tampering. It would be naive of us to think that the day will not come when these gangs will try to interfere with a jury. We are aware of many instances. If that day came and this legislation was not in place, opponents of this Government would be in uproar because we had not guarded against gangs interfering with juries. In 1972, when the current version of the Special Criminal Court was being introduced, the proposed legislation was strongly opposed by many of those who have now come out against the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill. The then Minister for Justice, former Deputy Des O’Malley, was asked in this House if he had any evidence that juries had been tampered with and he replied that he did not. He still went ahead and established the Special Criminal Court and the subsequent history of this country has shown that the Government in 1972 was right to do so. I have no doubt that time will prove the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is taking the right path in extending the Special Criminal Court to cover offences committed by organised criminal gangs. In 2002, the then deputy commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police Service, Mr. Ian Blair, appeared before the British Parliament’s select committee on home affairs. At this meeting he was questioned about his knowledge of jury tampering. He said that at the time, seven years ago, the Met was paying approximately £4. 5 million a year to protect juries and that jury tampering was becoming an increasing problem. One comment he made is of particular relevance to this debate. He said that jury tampering 'is usually connected with the organised criminal level because they have, not only if you like, the willingness to tamper with a jury or attempt to interfere with a juror, but also the ability to do it'. [209]We have had many examples, as I mentioned earlier, of jury tampering in this country. Intimidation in the form of the late night telephone calls, people sitting in the front rows of courts and a general presence. Earlier, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power alluded to the fact that the march in Limerick was being filmed not only by video cameras but by people with mobile telephones. It is an appalling vista. The charge of directing terrorism was introduced in Ireland in the wake of the Omagh bombing and it has been operated effectively over the past number of years. It has succeeded in taking out the leadership, and in many ways the brains, of one of the remaining Irish terrorist organisations. I only regret that this same charge had not been introduced 25 years earlier because it could have helped imprison a number of terrorist leaders who were happy to give the orders but who did not want to get their hands dirty or be accused of carrying out these orders. A similar charge of directing a criminal organisation is now being introduced in this Bill. This new charge carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment and will pose a serious threat to the untouchables who have benefited most from their criminal activities but who could not be tied to it because they got their more gullible followers to carry out their orders. This is a similar provision to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act which was introduced in the United States in 1970. That Act has become known in America as RICO and has effectively crippled and wiped out the Mafia in that country. The American Mafia is only a shadow of what it once was because of RICO and if the provision of directing organised crime is used effectively in Ireland, it will leave many of our criminal gangs leaderless and rudderless. A commentator this week said the Bill 'tramples upon the rule of law'. It sets out to uphold the rule of law and to protect innocent citizens whose lives are being destroyed by these criminal gangs. If anyone is trampling on the rule of law in Ireland it is these gangs and their members. They have shown in the past they will not listen to reason, will not abide by the standards expected in a civilised society and have no respect for the rule of law that this commentator was talking about. These gangs will be defeated only by the strong arm of the law, and this Bill gives the Garda the extra powers needed to put many of their leading members behind bars for many years. I urge all Members of the House to support this Bill.",Byrne

When one takes those numbers and calculates the percentage of members of the Government compared to the number of Members of the Legislature, it is more than 20%. This is one of the largest percentages in the EU. Deputies Hogan and Shatter have spoken about some of the roles performed by some of the Ministers of State. When I came into this House just under two years ago and participated in the committees, I was really surprised to learn that a chairman of a committee has an allowance of €20,000. This is an incredible amount of money for some chairmen who only chair two or three meetings. A vice-chairman gets €10,000 while convenors — I did not even know there were convenors — get €6,000 each. The public perception of politicians is that we are creaming it and in my view that is an unfair perception. However, as long as the Government chooses to do nothing about changing that perception, it will persist and it is a slur on the entire body politic. I have spoken many times about reform of the public sector. I have always said that reform should be done with a scalpel and not with a lump hammer. What I mean by a lump hammer is the public sector pension levy because that is lump hammer economics. It is a case of, 'Here you go, lads, a 7% decrease in your salary'. I do not know what will happen on 7 April but [263]perhaps the Ministers of State opposite know. However, it will be lump hammer economics again. It is a case of an increase in the standard and higher rates of income tax but without reform. The reason there is no reform is because there has been an entente between the Government, the management of all the public sector areas — the management are extremely well paid — and the public sector unions. The entente is obvious in the case of this proposal, unless the Government chooses to do something about it. There is no public sector union for Ministers of State so they are on their own. They will have to fight their own corner to stay in place. The Taoiseach is the manager in this case it is within his remit to decide that under the current circumstances, and because of the financial difficulties we face, the number of Ministers of State should be reduced. The only thing the public is looking for, and has been looking for since the budget last October, is fairness. Prior to the last budget, the Government’s spin doctors put out the line that the people who earn more would be expected to pay more. However, this did not happen as we saw with the attack on the medical card for old age pensioners and the other very unfair aspects of that budget. We do not need 20 Ministers of State 12 would be enough. I think it was the former Taoiseach, the late Charlie Haughey, who started the practice during the leadership contest with George Colley. I was only a child at the time but, if I remember correctly, Mr. Haughey promised people he would make them Ministers of State if they supported him, and that happened. He created positions so that he could become Taoiseach. It is a power game and the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, knows that better than most. How much time have I left, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle?",Carey
"This is not a matter of any great moment. It is a technical matter that ought to be put right since no longer can prison governors take recognisance from people granted bail in the District Court and remanded in custody pending the entering of a recognisance. It is not the substance of the Bill that deserves treatment this evening, but rather how this situation should have come about that this logistical difficulty for the Prison Service has been inadvertently created. I know it is not customary for ministerial colleagues to reflect on each other in terms of the [152]discharge of their legislative functions in the House it is especially unlikely when they are colleagues from other brethren in another place. I notice that the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform manages to do it but in that very sophisticated and euphemistic way one might miss unless one reads carefully his text. This is what he has to say about his predecessor, Mr. Michael McDowell: While I appreciate that in an ideal world [that is a Fianna Fáil world] it should not be necessary to introduce a short piece of legislation such as this in order to tidy up what could be called a loose end, sometimes this cannot be avoided. Minor conflicting provisions can sometimes be inadvertently overlooked when multiple Bills are being progressed within a short timescale. That is the present Minister’s view of his predecessor — these minor conflicting provisions can sometimes be inadvertently overlooked when multiple Bills are being progressed within a short timescale. This evening I was reading what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said in terms of the legislative style of the previous Minister. Expressed somewhat more trenchantly than the Minister expressed it, that is exactly what he said about the legislative style of the former Minister, Mr. McDowell. That is the main lesson to be taken from this. This is not the first time this has happened. It happened in the sexual offences Act also. Who knows as the year goes by whether some of the other legislation rushed through will not similarly be shown to have been fallible in some way. It is remarkable that it should come to this so quickly. The former Minister, who was a very considerable parliamentarian, especially when on this side of the House, when he changed sides, changed his view of the role of the Oireachtas. He began to see the Oireachtas as an impediment on the way to him enacting legislation that he knew was right and good for us. He thought the role of parliament was to rubber stamp the latest Bill he decided to bring before the House. That was very regrettable. As you remarked, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when holding the post I now hold, he often brought in more amendments to a Bill than sections in the Bill to start with. As I said on a previous occasion about the explanatory memorandum, the Minister never stood still long enough to create an explanatory memorandum in the case of much of the legislation he introduced. I wonder if this will be a lesson to us. Precepts were laid down here for the legislative process whereby one got two weeks’ sight of a Bill before one was required to address the broad principle on Second Stage. There was a similar period before Committee Stage and a short period between the end of Committee Stage and Report Stage. It is equally important that the opportunity is available at the end of Committee Stage to reflect before Report and Final Stages. [153] As Shakespeare would have said, that was 'more honoured in the breach than the observance' in the last parliament. That was a great pity and it leaves one lacking in confidence about some of the legislation that was rushed through. That is more especially the case when one has to agree with Mr. Michael O’Higgins SC, quoted by Deputy Flanagan, that one suspects that some of it was put through for political motivation close to a general election. That was not a sufficiently good reason to bring in dramatic changes to the criminal law. Will this abuse of parliamentary process end here? It happened frequently and not only with the former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, whose energy I admired in the last parliament. Other Ministers did it too. One has to conclude that it is part of the growing disdain for this House, the Oireachtas and the parliamentary process that the Executive knows best and the Executive arrogates to itself all power. If there is one dominant party in permanent office it lends itself to that abuse of parliament. There are inevitably people, given that they are intelligent, in the permanent Government who begin to look to see which side of their bread is buttered and they tend to act to acquiesce in things that they would not acquiesce in if there was a healthy alternative Government elected by the people. One cannot blame the permanent Government for that, one has to blame us on this side of the House. It is an unhealthy situation where on the hoof a Minister can be facilitated and backed up to make changes in the law, on inadequate reflection and insufficient consultation, creating in this case this type of logistical difficulty for the Prison Service. There is no doubt it could be of greater consequence. 9 o’clock The Minister tells us that the only issue at stake here is simply the question of who is authorised to take a recognisance, that the terms or conditions of bail are not at issue and there is nobody on bail who is not properly entitled. I take it all of that is true. I would like to hear the Minister say when this came to light. The change in the Act that reversed the earlier provision is effective since 1 July. When did it first come to notice? Can we be sure that recognisances were not accepted by a person not appropriately designated under the law as it has stood until today? Was there any incident where a District Court judge could not be found at a weekend or whenever to comply with the law as it has been up to today given the impact of the reversing of the earlier terms? It seems somewhat remarkable that there should have been no incidents of inconvenience caused to the Irish Prison Service when a District Court judge could not be found and there was no alternative arrangement in place. It should give us all pause for thought on the notion that legislation is the solution to all our difficulties in today’s criminal environment and the difficulties that are daily reported in the news[154]papers. The law must change to accommodate and acknowledge the changes taking place in society, which are inevitable. However, it must change after a period of adequate reflection, consultation, discussion and public debate. There will always be a necessity to change the law and modernise it to enable it to combat new developments in the criminal underworld for example. However, the biggest issue confronting us at the moment is the issue of law enforcement. According to the figures the Minister gave to Deputy Shortall, of some 137 murders since 1998 there have only been 20 convictions, approximately 15%. That is clearly a cause for concern and the detection rate for gun murders has been falling. One of the new breed of vicious criminal overlords would draw the conclusion of having a reasonably good prospect of escaping detection and paying the price for such criminal activity. That ought to be the focus of the Minister and others in the House. I am not suggesting that where legislative change is necessary we should not make that change. Regarding enforcement and all that goes with it, I started this morning with a meeting about anti-social behaviour in my constituency. The extent of the phenomenon of anti-social behaviour that ordinary law-abiding people must put up with is of great concern. In that case the people in Jobstown are extremely upset that the commitment to install closed circuit television will not proceed because of an underestimate in the budget. As the funding is now somewhat short the system cannot be installed, which is a great pity because of the extent and scale of anti-social behaviour in that area. Regarding the community policing of the area, one person has been taken off and another has been injured, which means there is scarcely any effective community policing in the area. I suspect that is repeated in many urban areas — the circumstances are somewhat different in certain rural areas. However, if we have that kind of difficulty with the enforcement of the law, the reforms introduced are either not yet working or were not sufficient in themselves, which also needs attention. I agree with Deputy Charles Flanagan on the lesson of this particular late-night legislating. As the Minister said, in an ideal world this type of thing should not happen. One wonders how it did happen. We will hear that story in four or five years. Are the people concerned with the drafting so different and separate that there was no comparing of notes? Was the rush such that they did not have time or was it purely an accidental omission? I accept entirely the Minister’s word that nobody is on bail who should not be on bail and that no substantive issue exists here. However, I find it very difficult to accept that this has not impacted on incidents where recognisance could not be entered because of what has happened here. I will close with a plea that we should revert to good practice in terms of addressing the heavy [155]legislative schedule on the Minister’s plate. In fairness to his predecessor, he put through much legislation. It must be a very heavy onus on the departmental officials. However, in this area we are dealing with life and death, freedom and imprisonment, etc. It is scarcely an area into which we should rush without permitting the kind of public debate that can tease out some of these more difficult issues rather than finding ourselves having to deal with the legislation after it has been enacted by this House. I hope the Minister at the outset of his career as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform feels that he is able to say to us that the normal good legislative process will be observed in this House in the future. I do not anticipate any party on this side of the House wanting to withhold from the Minister the kind of consent we gave on this occasion if there is a necessity to put urgent legislation through the House for a genuine purpose. However, in the normal course of doing our business here we ought to be given time to reflect, take professional advice, consult and hear inputs from community and professional organisations that wish to comment about the operation of the law.",Flanagan
"Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas agus mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leat, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht a bheith tofa mar Cheann Comhairle ar an 30ú Dáil. I congratulate you on your appointment as Ceann Comhairle of the 30th Dáil. Coming as you do from Cahirciveen in the deep south, you bring with you a wonderful tradition from a county with which I have strong associations. In fact, you will now have to develop a little style of your own, as all your predecessors did, either by accent or by action. I recall asking a former Minister for Education, Mr. Richard Burke, who came from close to the location of a former distinguished Ceann Comhairle, Mr. Seán Treacy, where they got the accent. He said: 'It’s the limestone. It sticks in your throat.' I am not sure what will be your quirk after five years. It is an honour and a privilege to be nominated to contest the position of Taoiseach in this Dáil and House of Parliament. I thank Deputy Richard Bruton for nominating me on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Pat Rabbitte for supporting that nomination on behalf of the Labour Party. I congratulate Deputy Bertie Ahern and give him credit for his persistence and permanence in the political field in Ireland. For him, this is not just an honour it is one that is almost unprecedented in that only one of his predecessors since the foundation of the State had the opportunity and privilege of serving three times as Taoiseach. I suppose we should all be glad for small mercies in that he has decided to begin the long glide to retirement, as he has already announced. Standing in this position five years ago I said we would support the Government in the interests of the country where we felt that was necessary, and that we would oppose the Government and hold it to account where we felt that was necessary. We have had jousts in the House during Leaders’ Questions and on other occasions but I accept the verdict of the people, the consequences of the proportional representation system and the decision of the Dáil today in nominating Deputy Bertie Ahern and confirming him as Taoiseach. Five years ago I set out to make him history but I did not quite get there on this occasion. We live in a very different world than we did five years ago. Both nationally and internationally, things have turned on their head. Circumstances for the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government he is to announce, are very different from five years ago in terms of the economic challenge that faces the country and the changed national and international circumstances. Given the Taoiseach’s infernal ability to create or construct a Government of incompatibles, I must wish him well in what he does. He mentioned that he had been elected ten times over 30 years, which is true. At least in one respect, I have a slight edge on him in that I have been in the [54]House for 32 years and have been elected 11 times. On this occasion, I have had the opportunity to bring back with me 20 new or re-elected Deputies. For me personally, this was the most enjoyable election campaign I have ever fought. To see democracy in one’s own constituency gives one an understanding of the movement taking place but to lead a national campaign on behalf of a national party through 43 constituencies really brings home the impact and the importance of every single vote, and how important that is to our democracy. I congratulate Deputy Bertie Ahern. I wish him well in his endeavours and in the challenge that faces him. I assure him that this party, with the increased mandate which we sought and were given, will support the Government in the interests of the country where we deem that appropriate and responsible, and we will continue to hold the Taoiseach and whatever Ministers he appoints to account on issues on which we feel they should be held to account. It was Einstein who said: 'Try not to be a man of success try also to be a man of value.' I hope at the end of the Taoiseach’s tenure of office that this is what the people will judge him by.",Ahern
"The scheme will counter perverse incentives for insurers to focus on younger age groups, with insured persons less likely to face higher increases or product segmentation related to their age. Deputies also raised the issue of possible overcompensation for the VHI. The purpose of the scheme is not to compensate the VHI but to continue making health insurance affordable for older people and those with poorer health. Under the scheme individuals aged 50 years and older receive the tax relief irrespective of their insurers. The VHI has a significantly older age profile than the other two insurers. Furthermore, having regard to proportionality, the scheme has been designed so that it only partially compensates VHI. The Minister will on Committee Stage be bringing forward amendments to section 9(3) to give the Health Insurance Authority greater direction on the evaluation and analysis of the data it will be getting from the insurers and which will form the basis for the levy and credit in subsequent years. With regard to the profits announced by VHI, the figures quoted refer to the annual returns for the year ending February 2008. The more recent returns covering the ten months to the end of December 2008 show that VHI was loss making, hence the level of premium increase it had to put in place at the start of this year. Deputies raised the issue of the cost of health insurance for families, the cost of the levy for children and the position on waiting periods where higher levels of cover are taken out. Setting the levy at one third of the adult rate, or €53, recognises that the premium charged for children is significantly less than the adult price and that under the Health Insurance Acts the maximum amount that can be charged is 50% of the adult premium. The open enrolment regulations allow insurers to apply waiting periods when an insured person avails of higher levels of cover. This is a necessary protection for the insurers. Currently the waiting periods, which only apply to the additional elements of cover, are two years for a person under the age of 65 when first named under the higher contract or five years for a person of or over the age of 65 years. These waiting periods are being reviewed in the context of the preparation of the lifetime community rating regulations which will be put before the Houses for approval in the autumn. Deputies also raised the issue of the possible size of the premium increases for over 60s in the absence of the scheme. It was incorrectly asserted this could not have taken place in a community rated system. Specifically targeted multiple products that provide different levels [273]of cover above the minimum benefit for different types of conditions or higher priced products for older people and cheaper products targeting younger people lead to a fragmented market. These plans could still have been community rated in that they could have been made available in principle to all persons at the same price while in practice not being appropriate to all age groups or types of health status. This interim scheme and the longer term robust risk equalisation scheme will remove this incentive for fragmentation and support intergenerational solidarity, making the elderly, chronically ill and diabetics more attractive to the insurers who have gone after that market. Deputy Jan O’Sullivan asked why we are not bringing in the long-term scheme at this juncture. Having regard to the Deputy’s point in regard to bringing forward a revised risk equalisation scheme at this time, the Bill before us is a specific response aimed at supporting the key principles of the market. Work on a long-term risk equalisation scheme will intensify following the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. It was not feasible to amend the previous scheme in the short term as, in addition to the specific issue on which the Supreme Court ruled, a range of other issues had also been put before the courts which would have to have been considered in bringing forward any amendments to the previous scheme. I thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate. While the Bill contains two provisions which have attracted public attention, namely, the levy and credit, it is also important to bear in mind that the other key provisions in the Bill which reinforce the concept of intergenerational solidarity, community rated health insurance and the protection of older people are at the core of the health insurance system and strengthen the regulatory functions of the Health Insurance Authority on consumer protection. It is intended that Committee Stage of the Bill shall be taken on Tuesday, 9 June 2009. Question put. The Dáil divided: Tá, 59 Níl, 38.

"I reiterate that the funds collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are returned to the Exchequer, which funds many of the initiatives for which I have responsibility. I refer not only to the drug task forces, but also to a range of other facilities and funds that are aimed at safeguarding the well-being of society. Deputy Wall spoke about the importance of sport, which is generally funded through the Exchequer, which derives some of its income from the Criminal Assets Bureau. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for Deputy Byrne to direct her specific request to the Minister for Finance. In these difficult and challenging times, it is important to examine the effectiveness of the more than 500 projects which are funded through the drug task forces. While I understand the difficulties faced by task forces, I am afraid they will have to prioritise those projects that are delivering the effective outcomes needed in communities and make choices on that basis.",Byrne

"I am pleased, in my renewed position as a member of the parliamentary Labour Party, to be able to speak on the banking crisis and the financial situation. Since the outset of this crisis, when the Labour Party stood alone to oppose the blanket bank guarantee, I have always strongly opposed the entire approach of the Government and especially its policy of bailing out the casino banks, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society. These two institutions were not and are not of systemic importance to the Irish banking system and as institutions they behaved recklessly and criminally for the benefit of a small nexus of cronies. The approximate €50 billion bank bailout figure announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, last Thursday week was horrific. Many people are still trying to understand how the toxic triangle of developers, bankers and Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael politicians has got us into such a mess that the Government intends to pour €29 billion to €35 billion into Anglo Irish Bank, €5. 4 billion into Irish Nationwide, perhaps €11 billion into AIB, €3. 5 billion into Bank of Ireland — one may not have heard the entire story in that regard — and €350 million into the Educational Building Society. A few weeks ago, a Sunday newspaper estimated the full costs of the systemic bailout to be between €45 billion and €55 billion for the recapitalisation and perhaps €45 billion for NAMA. When added together, this provides a possible total cost of €100 billion. In addition, the impact on the national debt is staggering, as the general deficit will hit 32% of GDP for 2010, even though only a few months ago, the Taoiseach was in this Chamber blathering on about how to cope with a debt of 20% of GDP. The question being asked by all Members’ constituents is whether the mind-blowing figures announced on black Thursday constitute the final reckoning. The key concern of everyone observing Members today is whether this is the bottom line on how much the Irish banking sector will need. All the Minister’s previous estimates have turned out to be wildly incorrect, misleading, inaccurate and sometimes simply downright lies. Consequently, why or how can citizens accept this latest forecast to be definitive? A number of months ago, a financial analyst informed me of his belief that the bailout losses would be approximately €50 billion at a time when the Minister was still insisting they would reach a maximum of €35 billion. Moreover, banking expert Mr. Peter Mathews also has mentioned an incredible figure of €65 billion. As there are so many basic pieces of information about which Members have no hard data, the Minister should respond to the questions I am about to pose. How much will the promissory notes cost each year into the future? What about the exclusion from NAMA of the loans between €5 million and €20 million? Will the €7 billion of debt represented by these smaller loans not act as a deadweight on AIB and Bank of Ireland for decades to come? Will Ireland end up as another Japan over the next two decades, that is, treading water, barely trying to keep going and with a national debt of 200% of GDP? What impact will the Hallowe’en deadline for NAMA transfers have on the figures? The original intention was to work through them carefully and slowly but it now must be done within two or three weeks and surely the entire point of NAMA was to examine forensically every bad loan. Will even more surprises emanate from NAMA after 31 October? Its chairman, Mr. Frank Daly, now appears to be stating that the final figure will not be known until February 2011. [593]The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told Members that one of the key objectives of NAMA was to remove the toxic loans from the banks’ balance sheets and to get liquidity back into the system. However, the bigger than expected discounts that NAMA is now applying to loans mean that the banks need much bigger sums of public money for their recapitalisation. Only yesterday, the Minister informed me that the interest figure for 2010 will be approximately €300 million less than the €5 billion he indicated to Members earlier this year. However, he stated that next year, it will be between €6. 7 billion and €7 billion. This means that a huge chunk of national taxation will go down the tube month after month into the vortex of this horrible disaster. If this is the true picture of how profoundly damaged is the Irish banking system, why is this only being found out two years down the road? Banks in the United Kingdom, which adopted a completely different policy in 2008, are already returning to profitability. The Labour Party urged early action to clean up the banks and to restore liquidity for businesses and households but what we got instead were two disastrous wasted years with soaring unemployment, emigration and misery because of the constant dissembling and gross incompetence of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and his colleagues. The Fianna Fáil-Green Party bank bailout has been characterised by constant misinformation and uncertainty about the true state of the banks. Incidentally, as I have stated a number of times at the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department of Finance has proved itself to be not fit for purpose. Clearly, it has a major role in the banking and economic collapse through its total failure to undertake effective economic forecasting, effective strategic plans — Deputy Reilly mentioned that point this morning — or to even moderately invigilate the banks. Shortly after the 2007 election, I asked that Mr. Neary, the then Financial Regulator, be invited before the Committee of Public Accounts to explain himself because I believed there was a fundamental problem with the banks. Mr. Neary appeared before the committee and told its members an outrageous pack of lies about the stability of the banking sector in early 2008. While a member of the aforementioned committee up to a few months ago, I read out what he had to say and every line he told members was rubbish, nonsense and lies. Although Professor Brian Lucey first raised the issue of the lack of legislation permitting subordinated bondholders to share in the losses unless the senior bondholders are in default and a bank is in a special form of parliamentary proceedings, Members did not hear this on black Thursday. We had to wait for several days until Brian Lucey told us in The Irish Times that additional legislation was required. The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, did not seem to have any idea from his briefing with the Department of Finance that there was a major problem in regard to subordinated bondholders and so on. Despite repeated statements to the contrary by various embattled Ministers, Professor Honohan’s report does not categorically find that a blanket guarantee was necessary. While he stated that it could be helpful in certain circumstances, he did not conclude that it was essential. Moreover, he questioned such a commitment to senior bondholders. That crazy decision was an act of criminal behaviour against Irish citizens. It was amusing this morning to hear the leader of Sinn Féin speak about being a party in opposition. The Labour Party was the only party in opposition in September 2008 when our 19 Deputies voted against the blanket guarantee in this Chamber. How can we have any trust in a system that is still largely administered by the senior bankers, Ministers, accountants, auditors and regulators who contributed so much to this catastrophe? The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has often described Anglo Irish Bank as being of systemic importance to the banking system. Yet he gave the institution a blank cheque in September 2008 without being aware of its true situation. No evidence was ever produced to [594]support the claim of systemic importance. A pertinent footnote in Professor Honohan’s report considers the notion of a bank guarantee for all the institutions with the exception of Anglo Irish Bank. Yet we had various Ministers talking to the media who had not even read the report. Phoenix magazine has rightly raised the grave matter of whether the current regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, accepted questionable figures from the board of Anglo Irish Bank in its 2009 annual report. The folly of the Government’s blank cheque approach to Anglo Irish Bank was exposed by the recent decision to split the bank into a so-called funding bank and an asset recovery bank with plans for an eventual wind-down of the failed bank without it ever having positively contributed to economic recovery. What was the purpose of the Government decision in this case? The Government continues to refuse to address the responsibility of senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank. There is still a strong case to liquidate the bank and its fellow casino institution, the Irish Nationwide Building Society, as quickly as possible and with as little further cost to the Irish people as possible. We should seek to recover all taxpayer losses from the perpetrators of this disaster. People ask me every day why Seán FitzPatrick, his fellow directors and senior management have not been prosecuted as would be the case in most other countries. In the case of the Chilean disaster, for example, the director of the company in question is already in police custody. The Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government childishly attempted to smear the Labour Party’s original banking policy to nationalise temporarily those banks that are of systemic importance, namely, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, in order to protect ordinary depositors and to get credit moving to businesses and householders. The Black Thursday announcement by the Government reminded me of the famous description by Seamus Mallon of the Good Friday Agreement as 'Sunningdale for slow learners'. It took the Government two years to realise there were fundamental problems with Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. According to the Minister, Allied Irish Banks will require capitalisation of at least €11 billion with the result that the State will have 90% ownership of the bank. If it had been temporarily nationalised two years ago there would have been a lower cost and a reduced risk to taxpayers as well as the opportunity for the State to clear out the senior bankers who made the bank insolvent. Under a nationalised system the valuation risk is massively reduced as loans can be transferred at market value rather than according to the Minister’s fantastical notion of long-term economic value under NAMA. Both the IMF and the former Swedish Finance Minister, Bo Lundgren — who undertook a very successful temporary nationalisation programme in that country — highlighted this reduced risk factor as one of the most important advantages of nationalisation. What has become clear in the past two years is that the appalling practices of the top bankers in Allied Irish Banks must be rooted out once and for all. That culture must be smashed. This is particularly imperative given the repeated scandals of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s at the bank. That so-called distinguished gentleman, Mr. Peter Sutherland, has in recent weeks been lecturing the nation on the need to reduce social welfare provision, education spending and so on. Is this the same Mr. Sutherland who was chairman of Allied Irish Banks in the 1990s when acts of gross criminality were carried out against taxpayers? Is it the same Mr. Sutherland who was a director of Royal Bank of Scotland when it had to be bailed out by the British taxpayer for at least €45 billion? Is it the same Peter Sutherland who was so closely connected to Goldman Sachs, an organisation described by the last British Prime Minister as 'guilty of moral bankruptcy', a company which defrauded tens of thousands of American investors with a Ponzi scheme whereby credit derivatives were bundled into packages, floated off and then bet against? Why should we heed Mr. Sutherland’s advice about anything? [595]I have the same objections to being offered advice by Mr. Ray MacSharry who, as Minister in the late 1980s, implemented savage cutbacks in services. Those cuts led to desperate suffering for our most vulnerable citizens some of whom died waiting for hospital treatment. That was the legacy of the implementation of Mr. Colm McCarthy’s first programme of reductions. If Allied Irish Banks had been temporarily nationalised two years ago it might not have had to sell its crown jewels in the form of its profitable operations in Poland and the United States. The Minister should consider the retention of the bank in public ownership as a national 'good bank'. We had such a good bank in the 1980s and early 1990s when the State effectively owned the various TSB banks, together with ACC and ICC. In the 1992 general election, my party proposed a third force or people’s bank loosely based on an amalgamation of the three State banks led by TSB. There is no question that such a model would have worked and would have provided much needed domestic competition to Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. We should explore the possibility of making all 4. 25 million citizens equal shareholders in Allied Irish Banks, as one of my constituents constantly advises me. The British Co-operative Society has a membership, at 5 million, that is larger than the population of this country. We should take 100% control of Allied Irish Banks and retain it in public ownership for a long time to come. The Labour Party has also developed proposals for a strategic investment bank to provide credit facilities to small and medium-sized enterprises, invest in innovative companies and take the lead in raising finance for appropriate infrastructural products. If we lead the next Government we will implement that proposal. Apart from Anglo Irish Bank, the failure of the Government, Central Bank and Financial Regulator to regulate the Irish Nationwide Building Society is one of the greatest financial crimes against the Irish people. Raising €2. 7 billion and paying savage interest on that vast sum for years just to dump it into the black hole of INBS is a criminal policy and an act of treachery against this country. Constituents ask me all the time why Mr. Michael Fingleton and his directors and senior management have not been prosecuted. The shocking failure of corporate governance at the Educational Building Society between 2002 and 2008 shows the contempt of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrat Party and the Green Party for mutual institutions. The EBS board and all its senior executives from the pre-September 2008 era should depart immediately. Its actions in becoming involved in speculative commercial developments bankrupted this society and betrayed its 600,000 members, of whom I am one. Those leaders should be investigated by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The Minister for Finance’s proposal to sell off the EBS is a profound mistake. I have already asked him to consider retaining the EBS in State ownership until the Government can establish a strengthened mutual building society and co-operative model. This new structure could perhaps be based on models such as the John Lewis Partnership or the Banque Populaire in France. We must take control of the EBS from the bottom up. Other governments including, surprisingly, the Conservative Party-Liberal Democrats coalition in Britain are examining measures to enhance the role of mutuals and co-operatives in a reformed banking system that prioritises the needs of ordinary households and businesses. Yet here in Ireland we are privatising the EBS even though it was probably the best organisation in the financial system. One of the broader issues that has been highlighted by the current catastrophic crisis is the rotten mortgage system that has enslaved many of our citizens. It was amusing this morning to listen to Mr. Peter Bacon speaking to Pat Kenny on the radio. He spoke on the very important subject of the huge burden of private debt, particularly on young people. Back-breaking mortgages are crucifying them. We need to look at the whole mortgage system. We should have built in a mechanism to alleviate this burden, as was done by some banks in the United States [596]which cut the capital figure. I welcome the campaign of bodies such as London Citizens, a wonderful organisation, which is trying to address the back-breaking nature of interest payments for many families and individuals in the United Kingdom. This approach needs to be extended to the Irish mortgage market. Auditing and accounting firms must also be held to account for their failure to detect and report out-of-control speculative and criminal activity in the banking system. Why have we not had an investigation of what went wrong in the auditing and accounting industry accompanied by major reforms to make sure it never happens again? Public confidence needs to be restored in these discredited professions. An ordinary Joe Soap would be sacked if he failed so abysmally to carry out his key work functions and responsibilities. Instead, the big four auditing and accounting firms, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young and Deloitte, and many other legal, accounting and auditing companies are allowed to carry on their merry way. Not alone that, they are at the heart of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party bank bailout strategy and paid millions. The law firm, Arthur Cox, for example, which was up to its neck in advising Anglo Irish Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland on property deals, was, rightly, named by The Sunday Tribune as one of the untouchables which caused the financial crisis, yet, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General, this company earned €3. 9 million between September 2008 and June 2009 for advising the Government on the State bank guarantee, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland. A Greek citizen, who is a certified auditor, contacted Members of the House to ask how, if Anglo Irish Bank’s accounts were certified by auditors, it went on to collapse. Another person e-mailed me yesterday and signed himself 'yours in despair'. He asked why Goldman Sachs is so heavily involved in Irish affairs, given its toxic role in the domestic and international financial crash. I have already referred to the unbelievable vapourings of Mr. Peter Sutherland. I have already mentioned The Sunday Tribune listing of 20 untouchables. It is outrageous that so many people mentioned on this shameful list are still in their positions, yet a number of members of this group, including senior civil and public servants, may wonder how they are part of the group while their political masters in Fianna Fáil and the PDs are nowhere to be seen, except, perhaps, in cupboards advertising the News of the World. The Sunday Tribune list is like Hamlet without the prince. The princes in this case are five politicians — three right-wing ideologues: the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, and former Ministers Charlie McCreevy and Michael McDowell and the current and former taoisigh, who are still trying to portray themselves as deluded fools, using the Bart Simpson defence. The poor former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is still waiting for Mr. Neary or Mr. Hurley to call to tell him the country is going down the tubes and something needs to be done to deal with the economic bubble. He does not know how this happened. He is going around the world lecturing people about the peace process. I accept we were all involved with that, and it is a wonderful achievement, and we were all involved in the Celtic tiger. It is incredible nonsense to tell us he is waiting for that call. It is also more than a little disturbing, as Senator Shane Ross has noted, that the Minister recruited the architects of the critical valuation system from deep within the toxic banking and property development vortex that helped to create this catastrophe in the first place. Did the Minister make any effort to recruit valuation experts internationally, especially from states such as Germany or the Netherlands that have had fairly stable property systems for the past decades? At the height of the property bubble the economist, David McWilliams, wondered how a small terraced house in Dublin 7 or 8 could be worth more than a chateau in southern France or a farm in Munster in central Germany. How could that have been possible? It is incredible [597]that the Department of Finance, regulators, taoisigh and Ministers for Finance could not understand that this was an anomaly. The role of the IFSC and its impact on national tax policy and the invasion by foreign banks, like Bank of Scotland, needs to be investigated. I commend the ordinary staff of banks, some of whom are facing tough futures, who looked after us day in and day out. They often point to the destabilising role of the off-shore element of the IFSC and how it damaged our larger banks. They talk, in particular, of the foreign invasion led by Bank of Scotland, which gave mortgages of more than 100%. Opposition Members raised this matter with the Taoiseach at the time but he did not seem to think he could do anything about it. Of course, he was only the Taoiseach. Ireland has a structural fiscal deficit but it is the banks and the Fianna Fáil-Green Party blank cheque approach to bailing out banks that has wrecked our fiscal position for the foreseeable future. In 2009, the budgetary position deteriorated by approximately €11 billion of the €22 billion, simply due to the banking crisis. Colm McCarthy, and those in the media and the Government who hang on his coat tails, told us, day after day, that we had a deficit of €22 billion. However, it was the banks that wrecked us, are wrecking us this year and will wreck us next year and the following year. It is so annoying to have to impose this on ordinary people. The Fianna Fáil-Green Party slash and burn approach means we will kill the patient in 2011 by totally deflating the economy and facilitating no stimulus measures to tackle the jobs catastrophe and enhance consumer confidence. In contrast, the policy of the Labour Party is the correct one. We have been clearly focusing on jobs and investments through our policies on the strategic investment bank and on investing in SMEs and innovative companies, retraining opportunities, schools, broadband, communications and public transport. I am a big supporter of major infrastructural investment. In my own region we have done huge preparatory work on metro north. Approximately €160 billion has already been spent on the project and it will, I hope, be passed by An Bord Pleanála in a few weeks time. The immediate preparatory works done next year will be of the order of only €50 million. As a public private partnership, it will not impose a great immediate cost as we try to get out of the fiscal crisis. We can frame a budget for next year. I believe we should do this year by year and one step at a time. The guys and girls who got us into this mess should not try to tie us down for four, five or ten years into the future. We must get out of the mess one step at a time. With a Keynesian-Paul Krugman approach we would gradually work our way out of the debt and rebuild our country. The people who are responsible for this, including the politicians, should be held accountable.",Lenihan
"I thank Deputy Seán Sherlock in the Labour Party for sharing his time with me. I very much support this Fine Gael motion moved by Deputy John Perry. He has a way with understatement, given that one of the bullet points in the motion states '- notes with concern that small businesses are still having difficulty accessing credit through financial institutions for a variety of reasons'. By God that is true. There is less than a trickle coming through. The few tokenistic measures taken by Government are not doing anything to improve the position. The Deputy’s next bullet point states '- recognises that the Government strategy of NAMA and bank recapitalisation has not produced a ‘wall of cash’ in credit for small business promised by the Minister for Finance'. That is certainly true as well. Rather than a wall of cash in credit having been produced for the SMEs a wall of isolation has been built around them in terms of their ability to obtain funding. The Government has done nothing practical to ensure that they will be funded. Admittedly, it has put some money into the banks and ticked the box that it is to be lent to the SME sector but that has not happened. I will spend a few minutes to go through the speech of the Minister, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, which I found most interesting. He took a different attitude from Deputy Perry to the subject of this motion. He said: 'I want to take this opportunity to again acknowledge the extraordinary work done by the Minister for Finance to address the banking problem.' Why would he not commend the Minister for Finance on that, given that he has done nothing else only address the banking problem in the past two years? That is not only true of the Minister for Finance but the entire Government has been dug into addressing the banking system and has ignored the rest of the economy. It could care less about it and it has done nothing positive to bring a solution, initiative or stimulus to the SME sector — so much for commending the Minister for Finance on what he has done. The Minister has not produced a wall of cash in credit for the SMEs, rather he has built a wall of isolation around them. The Minister, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, also told us about the code of conduct for SMEs. Whatever about other regulated agencies, the banks have danced a merry jig around the Government since the evening in September 2008 which they walked into Government Buildings and wagged the finger at the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. They have danced a merry jig around the Government since. If the Minister says they have not done so and if he is aware of what they were at, he must have been compliant in what they were doing. He must be supporting their carry on in not revealing — if they did not — the accurate situation to the Government. Which is the position? The Minister cannot have it both ways. They either danced a merry jig around the Government or the Government was playing along with them. Either way, the comment of the Minister, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, about this code of conduct being some kind of a lifesaver for SMEs is nothing short of ridiculous. The Minister also said: 'Firstly, the Credit Review Office is making a major contribution——",O'Keeffe

Deputy Seán Power without interruption.,Power
"That is kind of the Deputy. One of his more famous colleagues told me prior to the election that I would make a very good Opposition Deputy but it is not something I would like to do. I am very comfortable on the Government benches. Perhaps some colleagues have been on the Opposition benches too long to understand what is like to be a Government backbencher but I have spoken out on issues of concern to my community. I have not been afraid to raise issues or make radical points. However, the myth persists that Government backbenchers should troop through the Opposition lobbies during divisions which is a nonsense. The public does not believe that should happen anymore. It is unhelpful to the debate that every now and then Opposition Members say Government Deputies should vote against the Government. That is a nonsense and I will never do that. Previous speakers referred to the image of the Parliament and the work done in the House. RTE does its best with 'Oireachtas Report' and other programmes cover the business of the House. However, much of our proceedings is not covered, particularly committee work. I agree with colleagues who said the Chief Whip’s office should redouble its efforts to interest the media in the work of the committees. Many important issues are raised by committees and good work is done, which deserves more coverage. Constituents will always say they were watching television and there were only two or three Members in the House during a debate, which creates a different image. I have sympathy for Deputy Brian Hayes. The Minister of State has expressed his interest in scheduling a slot to discuss current issues in the House and this also relates to the ability of Government Deputies to raise issues. Very few Government Deputies raise issues under Standing Order 32 and the relevancy of these issues is a subject for debate. For examples, I could raise issues on every street in Tallaght every day under Standing Order 32 but where would that get me? I have sympathy with the notion that we change our system somewhat. We all welcome the opportunity given to us by the Ceann Comhairle’s office to seek Adjournment debates. When debates are granted, the Minister will come into the House with a prepared script, which is needed to provide information, but the debates do not work. I have pressed many issues on behalf of my constituents on the Adjournment. When I am bored I watch the television coverage of the House of Commons, for example, during Prime Minister’s Question Time. I watched it yesterday and it was riveting television. The coverage is also [820]interesting on other occasions. The speaker calls for contributions from the floor and members of all parties stand and are called by him or her. I am not sure exactly how the process works but it seems to be some type of rotation system. This means that Government MPs also have an opportunity to raise issues in this quick-fire way. I do not wish to be too radical but some variation of this procedure would assist parliamentary business and would be helpful for all Members. Government Deputies are always in the position of being somewhat constrained while their colleagues on the Opposition benches can raise all types of issues. We are obliged to find ways to get around this and I, for example, approach the Taoiseach and Ministers on a regular basis. I strongly support reform of Dáil procedures along the lines the Minister of State has indicated to make it easier for Members to ask questions about current issues. I hope I offend nobody in saying that most of us are agreed that the Adjournment debate has become somewhat dated and that a different system is required. In the past five years I had the honour of being a member of the Oireachtas Committees on Social and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality, Defence and Women’s Rights and, more recently, Government Whip on the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. The work of these committees sometimes goes unnoticed. Deputy Ardagh, the excellent Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women’s Rights, has spoken about the volume of good work done by that committee, with particular reference to the restorative justice report. This was a radical project that was piloted in Tallaght and in the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor’s, constituency in Nenagh. It showed how an Oireachtas committee could work well and in an innovative way. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children has also gained in importance in recent times. Like Deputy Naughten, I have a lengthy record of service on the former health board in my area. My views on recent changes in this area are on the record and I will not say something different today. Under the old health board system, our questions were answered and politicians from all parties were given notice of current and potential issues. That no longer happens. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children has played a crucial role for Members in filling some of the gaps in information. It has, for instance, been able to summon Professor Brendan Drumm and other officials and has facilitated progress on all sides. Life in the Chamber generally requires one to be part of the political game. At committee level, however, the relationships between Members from different parties are such that valuable work is regularly done. This is why I object to criticism of the committee system. I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, is conceding that changes could be made for the benefit of the [821]system. I hope he continues on the road on which he has embarked. He has great support, including from Members on the other side of the House, even though they must play the game as they see fit. The Minister of State is on the right track and I wish him well.",Hayes
"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Second Stage of this Bill. I welcome some aspects of the legislation as it stands, although I would suggest a review is needed of certain provisions. There are a number of inconsistencies between what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is advocating and what is contained in the Bill. The cutbacks and embargoes imposed by this Government on local authorities are responsible for the termination of contracts for a significant number of excellent planners. The Minister should have ensured those who deliver services can remain in their positions. The Bill proposes to extend the time permitted for planning permission in certain instances. Will this include an extension to the length of time for permission on projects which will be taken over by NAMA? The Minister has been highly critical of the decisions that permitted many of these projects to proceed, yet he intends that the time allowed for them can be extended automatically. I ask him to review this issue as a matter of urgency. [103]I regret that he is interfering in the planning process at local level. It would be a retrograde step were he to continue that practice. I say that because when the first Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963 came into operation on 1 October 1964 it became a mandatory function of local government to deal with planning applications. Prior to that the process was discretionary for towns and urban areas. Much has changed since then. Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to many bad decisions being taken by local authority members in County Galway. I was a member of Galway County Council with Deputy Higgins for many years. He was not totally accurate in some of what he said, because as a Minister he had responsibility for European directives. I know for a fact that he opposed the granting of a road licence to relieve flooding in south Galway in the 1990s. The whole world saw the recent impact of flooding on people as well as the flora and fauna in that area. He referred to people giving out about the importance of snails, birds and bees, but at the same time he was responsible for maintaining and retaining a flood plain in south Galway which affected people as well. I do not know how he can reconcile that and be at peace with himself. I accept that at that time there was an abuse of the provision known as 'section 4'. I am delighted that mechanism has ceased to operate in County Galway because councillors have now found a different way of dealing with the issue. I wish to put on record that we had a Minister of State with responsibility for local government who during the 1970s vehemently supported section 4s and put his name to them. Many other Members of the House would have done that subsequently. The system was abused but I accept there was a necessity for it in some cases. Planning is an executive function of the local authority and the majority of planners were excellent and honest and they delivered the service in a good way. Others fell foul of the system whether it was through greed or otherwise. A serious situation had developed in the past ten years and I hope that is over and done with. In effect, we have 88 planning authorities in this country. We have 29 local authorities, 49 town councils and ten borough corporations, whether they be city or county. As a result, it is inevitable that we would have inconsistencies in the delivery of the service and contradictions on city and county boundaries. If one were to look from east Galway into Tipperary one would see positive integrated planning of local development in County Tipperary but the east Galway area remains stagnant because we cannot develop due to the fact that more than two thirds of the county has a designation of one kind or another, for example, natural heritage area, special protection area or whatever else. In addition, we have another designation, usually following a decision by the local authority in conjunction with the Galway transportation study. That started and had an effect on an area within five or six miles of Galway city but it gradually extended and now there are restrictions half way up the Slieve Aughty mountains some 30 miles away. That area was already designated but now another layer of restriction has been added. The Minister must come to terms with the situation. It is difficult for professional planners who advise and decide on planning applications to manoeuvre between those restrictions and at the same time to be fair to the applicant. I welcomed the initiative by local authorities, on foot of a ministerial decision, to have local area plans. Local area plans might provide an opportunity to allow people to enhance their incomes in areas that are currently restricted. Due to restrictions, European directives and Government interference of one kind or another, farmers must resort to some other way of making a living in order to remain in Connemara, Portumna, Slieve Aughty or wherever else in the county. Galway is a county of immense contrast between east and west and north and south. It is important that those local area plans would present an opportunity to allow people to enhance their income. I refer, for example, to tourism in east Galway. When one speaks of [104]tourism in County Galway one thinks of Galway city and Connemara and the rest is forgotten. Local area plans, properly put in place and directed, can present opportunities that will work. I am on record in this House as having said that Shannon Development was a shining example of where people could provide opportunities along the Shannon as far up as Lough Derg. Unfortunately, Shannon Development remained in Munster. It operated in counties Clare and Tipperary. In east Galway we looked with envious eyes across the Shannon at the type of developments that were taking place and that through good planning fitted hand in glove into the environment into which they were placed. We could not do that in Galway until now. Thank God, due to a more co-ordinated regional strategy, some positive development has been allowed to take place. Bad decisions were taken that resulted in flooding in south Galway in particular, in east Galway along the Shannon banks and in Ballinasloe. I accept that some of the flooding was not due to bad planning. When people are flooded insurance companies do not allow them to insure their properties any longer. In such cases it is important for the Government to consider a relocation plan. I do not refer to urban areas but to rural areas such as south Galway. Following the 1964 and 1965 flooding, three families were successfully relocated. That did not cost much. Five families now require to be relocated. Will the Minister and his colleagues who have responsibility for water management investigate the possibility of relocating these few houses? Four families need relocation because of the likely recurrence of flooding. The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works visited County Galway on two occasions. He saw what happened and he discussed the issues with the people. He was readily available and for that we thank him but, despite €1. 6 million being spent on studies on flooding in south Galway, no work has been done because of the demands of environmentalists and Government agencies such as the national parks and wildlife service, formerly Dúchas. Unless there is agreement between agencies before we start, the ideas of, and the resources made available, by the Government will come to nought again. Reference was made to one-off housing, which has been described with catchphrases such as 'bungalow blitz' and 'a blight'. However, many people had to return to their homes and acquire a site from a parent or a sibling to provide themselves with housing in rural areas because of the explosion in the cost of housing during the boom. They were criticised by a number of groups, including An Taisce. The Minister’s intention is to increase the number of agencies that have to be consulted about a planning application. Standard agencies such as An Taisce will still be consulted. People say local authority members and public representatives at large are the enemies of An Taisce but its officials have made many fine recommendations in various places and it was necessary for them to intervene where cowboys were at work. The Minister stated, 'Specifically, the programme for Government 2007-2012 states that the Government will ensure that the Citizens Information Board has the necessary resources to assist and inform the public on planning procedures'. When he replies, will he indicate what resources he will provide to the board? Is he satisfied its staff have the capacity to make reasonable contributions and observations on individual planning applications or in a community context? I agree consultation before decisions are taken is always good but under this legislation another agency will be engaged in the planning process on top of An Taisce, the national parks and wildlife service and the National Roads Authority, NRA. The provision of infrastructure is important and in the past NRA decisions were imposed on the local planning authorities who were told some of their planning applications were premature because of the possibility of alternative routes being used by the authority. We were plagued with these decisions in County Galway. The new M6 motorway between Galway and [105]Dublin is welcome but another national road runs between Ennis and Tuam and passes through Gort and Oranmore. Serious restrictions have been placed on development along these routes. I do not refer to merchants and builders who are in for the quick kill but necessary development could take place near these routes. The NRA, therefore, has had a serious impact on planning. I do not know whether this was ever envisaged. When the authority was first involved in the planning process, it restricted the number of slip roads on national primary routes. This was a great decision in the interest of safety and many lives may have been saved as a result but, at the same time, is it necessary for this agency to be involved? Ireland is unique in Europe, as it provides for a third appeal in its planning system but it is regrettable that, in many instances, the advice and decisions of planners who report on appeals to An Bord Pleanála are overturned and disregarded by the board. The Minister needs to investigate this issue because when local elected representatives ignored planning advice from local authorities under the old section 4 provision, they were criticised heavily. Nobody knew anything about it until somebody read the file and found a planner’s report had been rejected and disregarded and a different decision taken. Something needs to be done to tighten that up. I am delighted the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is present. Many areas in County Galway have been designated for wind energy development but there are major difficulties. The first is physical because they are in designated areas. A group of farmers in a community effort to provide a windmill in the Slieve Aughty mountains had to bring in experts from Scotland to provide a report on the possibility of hen harriers migrating to the area. As a result, the mountains were designated as a restricted area for development because of the potential for hen harriers to migrate in the area, even though none has never been seen in the area. However, the terrain is similar to the habitat of these birds. I refer to the cost of the projects and the number of people involved who have gone far down the line but who cannot access the national grid. Who will be taken in under the Gate 3 directive? Will the Minister intervene with EirGrid to ensure projects are connected? What would it mean to a Green Party Minister if the country could produce more renewable energy? Last Monday night I attended a community meeting in Clonfert, outside Eyrecourt, County Galway, on the banks of the River Shannon. The Government gave out a contract for the provision of broadband internet access under the national broadband strategy. However, certain areas have been left without broadband provision, despite the fact that this was one of the black spots at national level. A total of 111 district electoral divisions in County Galway alone will be officially without broadband. I ask the Minister to ensure that the entire area covered by the contract with 3 to which I referred — from Portumna along the banks of the Shannon, through Ballinasloe and as far as Ballygar — is provided with broadband because there is no sign of it currently in certain areas. I was told today by the Minister’s Department that it will certainly be 2011 before these areas will be provided with broadband. There are no broadband facilities available one cannot, under the present system, obtain access to any at all. I ask the Minister to review the situation as a matter of urgency and extend the marginal area by the River Shannon and in the east Galway area. All of the Galway East constituency is in the area covered by the contract. I remind the Minister that my colleague, Deputy Michael Kitt, was with me at that meeting and he said he would attempt to arrange a meeting between the Minister and the four Oireachtas Members from Galway East to discuss this matter. I would greatly appreciate it if the Minister could facilitate this.",Kitt
"I am delighted to speak immediately after Deputy Burton because as I came into the House I said there is an air of unreality about the debate today in that the proposer of the original motion is not here. I will not dwell on that it is a matter for Fine Gael. I will, however, dwell on the Alice in Wonderland that has been adopted by the Labour Party. I want to illustrate this, in particular, by reference to the two extraordinary reports which were published last week. Let us recall for a moment that when the reports were first proposed the Labour Party suggested they would be whitewashes. In his opening comments today Deputy Gilmore, with all his theatrical splendour, did better than I have seen him for a long time. He produced a flourish that would have done justice to Laurence Olivier in his best moments. Let us think for a moment. Where was the Labour Party on 30 September 2008 when the real test of political leadership in this country was coming to reality? To give credit where credit is due, when the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, at 7 a. m. on that day telephoned Deputy Enda Kenny he was assured that Fine Gael would behave in the national interest. I want to recognise that because Fine Gael has done that before and it is right and proper to do so. What was the response from the Labour Party? It was extraordinary by any standard. This country faced one of the worst challenges it had ever faced. We can debate as much as we want backwards and forwards and engage in Punch and Judy politics about what happened.",Lenihan

Previous communications from me and local residents with Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council have been ignored. I ask the Minister to intervene, take charge and appoint an independent official from his Department to deal with this urgent health issue (10) Deputy Jack Wall — the design lay-out of a school campus, details supplied, in regard to the safety of the students, recreational area for the students, general traffic control of the campus and the future of the campus (11) Deputy Bernard Allen — the totally inadequate services for children with diabetes in the Cork and south Munster area (12) Deputy Simon Coveney — the need for the Minister to outline how he plans to resolve the Cork Airport debt issue with the Cork Airport Authority and the Dublin Airport Authority and to give a time scale for a resolution of the matter (13) Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh — to extend the deadline of 2 November for submission of applications for the community child care subvention scheme and for a thorough review of the scheme in full consultation with the community and voluntary child care sector and the suspension of its introduction [1076]pending essential changes to ensure equity, accessibility and affordability for all users of these facilities (14) Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin — to suspend the introduction of the community child care subvention scheme pending full consultation with the community and voluntary child care sector, given the widespread concern at the impact of this scheme in its present form, including the creation of a two-tier child care system, increased costs for many families and the closure of facilities (15) Deputy Dan Neville — the discharge from Tallaght hospital of a suicidal person where a recruitment ban has prevented the hospital from appointing a suicide prevention nurse and (16) Deputy Chris Andrews — in light of recent difficulties, that the Minister for Health and Children encourage meaningful dialogue and consultation between the HSE and the IPU, the Irish Pharmarceutical Union, on the new policy on the pricing of drugs due to come into effect on 1 December 2007. The matters raised by Deputies Kathleen Lynch, Ciarán Lynch, Bernard Allen, Dan Neville and Jack Wall have been selected for discussion.",Andrews
"I move:        I wish to share time with Deputies Shatter, Clune and D’Arcy. Following the 2007 general election, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, decided to provide a few additional posts of responsibility as Ministers of State and committee chairmen to members of his party. People were mindful that this had happened previously but, nevertheless, the economic climate warranted political leadership in making the Oireachtas more cost effective and effective in parliamentary terms. This is about saving taxpayers’ money and making Ireland competitive in order that people can keep their jobs. It is about fairness in order that the matters about which the House must come to conclusions in the next few weeks can be seen to be taken in the context of fairness by public representatives. [257]In 2007, the number of Ministers of State was increased from 17 to 20 but nobody could understand the gaping hole in policy by which the increase was justified nor could anybody see the justification for additional committees and posts of responsibility because sufficient committees were appointed to do the same volume of work in the previous Dáil. Why did the then Taoiseach do that with the approval of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen? The only conclusion one can come to is he had to appease the unease in his parliamentary party to ensure members had posts of responsibility and were working hard on behalf of the people and, therefore, were not too concerned about the deterioration in the nation’s finances and increasing unemployment. The three newly appointed Ministers of State were scattered throughout various Departments. For example, at a time when the Health Service Executive is not even accountable to the House, the Department of Health and Children has four Ministers of State, one with responsibility for children and youth affairs, another with responsibility for health promotion and food safety, another with responsibility for older people and the fourth with responsibility for equality, disability and mental health. It is difficult to justify four Ministers of State for a Department that has abdicated responsibility and for which the Minister is not accountable to the House for the bulk of its budget. It is reasonable to ask what the Ministers of State do. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has three Ministers of State with another Minister of State who deals with issues cutting across multiple Departments. Four Ministers are, therefore, in the House for Question Time dealing with labour affairs, trade and commerce and science, technology and innovation. The roles and responsibilities of some of the Ministers of State in these areas are justified but not to the extent provided for in this Dáil. Fine Gael wants to know whether we need the current number of Ministers of State and whether the number can be reduced to ensure effective administration. Currently, responsibilities allocated to such Ministers are ineffective and unnecessary. The junior Ministers are entitled to their salaries but their offices cost a significant sum when support staff are taken into account. Senior Ministers have 33 staff assigned to them to deal with constituency work while the number assigned to Ministers of State is 85. Whey would a Minister of State require additional posts of responsibility for people to do constituency work when senior Ministers, who receive more correspondence, including from their parliamentary colleagues, require only 33 officials to address constituency business? The cost of the staff of senior Ministers is €3. 616 million while the cost of the staff of Ministers of State is €8. 2 million. That requires examination. Fine Gael believes the average cost of the office of a Minister of State is €750,000 annually but only 12, not 20, Ministers of State are required. Each Department does not need a Minister of State assigned to it. Given the responsibilities of Ministers and the busy lives they lead, cover must be provided at various events and functions and for departmental and parliamentary responsibilities. Delegating responsibilities to a Minister of State is essential if we want to ensure the Cabinet system works effectively and well on behalf of the country. I concede a Government Chief Whip is needed to ensure the parliamentary affairs of the State are overseen. A Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs is required given the large number of meetings on European issues. However, I am not sure Ministers of State with responsibility for lifelong learning and the Information Society are needed. Other people could cover these areas over a cup of coffee judging by the throughput we have witnessed. What does 'local services' mean in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government? Rationalisation is easy to accomplish in the Department of Health and Children which has four Ministers of State who have no responsibility for the largest budget in the State. This is given to the HSE, which is not even accountable to the House. [258]The motion is intended as a catalyst to discuss the various issues in which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been interested since Christmas. He has been talking out loud about the need for parliamentary reform and the way the political class must show leadership on this matter. Three weeks ago, he stated, 'It is now time for all of the political parties in Dáil Éireann to play their part. They need to lead by example and show those people currently feeling the pain that the political class will play its part'. That is a noble statement by a Minister whose party is a partner in government with Fianna Fáil. I am sure he has influence over decisions made at the Cabinet table. Why is he in government otherwise? The Minister could at any time decide to make this a major issue but he has chosen not to do so to date. All we have from him is rhetoric with no indication that he is serious about electoral reform because he has not even set up the electoral commission, which was promised in the programme for Government in 2007. We are on the verge of local and European elections. We were told an electoral commission would be in place to oversee them as a trial run before the next general election but there is no sign of any change. The Electoral (Amendment) Bill before the House is the epitome of the failure of the Minister to initiate and implement a programme of electoral reform. The net point of the legislation is how many days are required before posters can be erected prior to polling day. If that is the best that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, can do I would not like to see the end result in the White Paper on local government reform. This was promised for before the end of 2008 but we have not yet seen it although we are on the verge of European and local elections. Those who will be elected to local government on 5 June do not know in advance what the Minister has in mind and have no programme of legislation or policy devolved to local government that will give them any meaningful involvement in the affairs of their communities. It is business as usual, as the Taoiseach said recently about the economy and Anglo Irish Bank. It is business as usual too for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley. We will hear a great deal but will see no action on his genuine concerns about reforming this House, having a leaner and more effective administration and devolving real power to communities through their local government system, in the form of a White Paper on local government. I look forward to the proposals but I do not think I will see much meat on them between now and 5 June. Tonight’s Fine Gael motion gives the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and others like him, an opportunity to reflect on their rhetoric and take action tomorrow night by voting with the Opposition on some of our proposals. It is not a comprehensive package of electoral reform but a small item that will make a meaningful contribution to showing the public that we are serious about becoming more effective and making Departments leaner for the times we are in. I was heartened to see that many staff are allocated in various ways in Departments but I know now why Ministers and Ministers of State have been so busy doing constituency work since Christmas. They have enormous resources and contributions that people on this side of the House would love to have. We do a reasonable job with a parliamentary assistant and a secretarial assistant. Why not let everyone have the same resources to look after their constituencies? They would do it effectively and well. There is no reason that any Ministers or Ministers of State who have significant backup, apart from constituency office staff in their Departments, cannot do their personal constituency work with two people in their constituency offices. That is a reasonable suggestion, instead of Ministers of State having an average of eight staff doing their constituency office work. Ministers of State have a total staff of 189, at an annual cost of [259]€8. 24 million, while Ministers have a staff of 78 at a cost of €3. 6 million. If an bord snip nua examines how this House does its business, those proposals speak for themselves in favour of rationalisation. We have heard too many promises from this and previous Governments about the need to carry out parliamentary reform. Deputies Stagg and Stanton, and others, have been to the fore in contributing to that debate but it is up to the Government to bring forward proposals to make this Chamber represent the electorate more effectively. Some of its procedures are so archaic and out of date that reform is urgently needed. People demand and expect this of us. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, has a legitimate and genuine interest in how this House conducts its business. In his response to this motion he might flesh out how we can have meaningful Dáil reform, with accountability from quangos, some of which we do not need, and from Ministers of State in terms of the effectiveness of their responsibilities in these financial circumstances, and also what committees we need. Committees are necessary to shadow the Departments. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which sat today for 90 minutes to discuss the social housing programme. We could not spend that much time in plenary session here doing such detailed work. Committees are important but we do not need all of them. After the last general election many were established for political convenience rather than for the work they might do. While some people need remuneration for their work, Members of this House can take their responsibilities seriously by being chairmen, vice-chairmen or convenors of committees without remuneration. It is a great honour and privilege to represent one’s constituency here and to be asked to take on such a responsibility by the Houses of the Oireachtas and one’s party. People would look forward to that additional responsibility and to getting stuck into work they would not have the opportunity to do as an ordinary Deputy. I suggest that there is an opportunity to have a meaningful debate about how we do our business, the number of people we need to do it and how we can be a more effective Parliament and Government. We do not need as many Ministers of State. Government Members, particularly those in the Green Party, will have the opportunity to vote with the Opposition tomorrow night in favour of reducing the Ministers of State from 20 to 12, and the number of ministerial constituency office staff to two. That would be a start in showing whether they are genuine about meeting the objectives about which we have recently heard so much rhetoric from the Minister, Deputy Gormley.",Carey
"I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity of raising this very important issue. It seems to be all bad news with regard to the health service. I seek a clear commitment from the Minister of State that the €39 million redevelopment of Ennis General Hospital will proceed. At least in the case of Naas General Hospital, a €75 million project was completed in 2003 but we have not seen any money like that in Ennis General Hospital. The Ennis Hospital Development Committee has on occasions been accused of scaremongering. However, the constant downgrading and withdrawal of services from County Clare does little to dispel the fear that there is a hidden agenda to reduce Ennis hospital to little more than a first aid injury clinic. At a meeting with the Minister for Health and Children which I attended on 20 September 2007, she indicated that this development would proceed. When the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, visited Ennis in May, prior to the general election of course, he was happy to show up for the photocall announcing that the development had progressed to planning, saying that it 'symbolises Fianna Fáil’s ongoing commitment to safeguarding and developing the health services available to the people of County Clare'. I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question on 31 January 2007 and I have been advised in writing by the HSE that the review of the acute services in the mid-west is to be published shortly and that this review is likely to have significant implications for capital developments for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, I have heard from reliable sources that this review is likely to recommend that this project does not proceed or that it could be delayed. Alarm bells are ringing and I have grave concerns. The drip by drip leaking of reports and the [652]downgrading by stealth of services in County Clare is an emergency health warning to the people of Clare that a decision has already been made with regard to Ennis General Hospital. The population of County Clare is 103,277, with more than 44,000 of the county’s population outside the golden hour travelling time away from an accident and emergency department. Over 25,000 tourists stay in County Clare overnight during the summer season and Shannon International Airport is on our doorstep, handling 3. 4 million passengers. It is also the designated emergency airport for all western traffic. This seems to matter little to this Government which has presided over the downgrading of health services in our county. The HSE’s vision for 2010 as outlined in its Transformation Programme 2007-2010 of easy access, confidence and staff pride, meant nothing to the three expectant mothers living in west Clare when no ambulance was available to transfer them to Limerick Maternity Hospital. The ambulance service in County Clare is under-resourced and clearly understaffed. The staff are working in appalling conditions and must clean out their ambulances with a mop and bucket. The vision of easy access means nothing to the women of Clare who, following the closure of mammography services in County Clare may now face up to a two-year delay for a publicly funded mammogram in Limerick. It means nothing to those patients in County Clare who, following the closure of the rheumatology services at Ennis, cannot meet with a rheumatologist in Limerick because one consultant cannot possibly handle the numbers. The lives of people who live in Clare, especially in west Clare, who suffer major traumas will be put at further unnecessary risk as they will not receive emergency treatment in time following the decision to bypass Ennis for all such cases from April next. Access to Limerick Regional Hospital at certain times of the day is a disaster. If the bypassing of Ennis hospital is not reversed then at the very least an air ambulance service should be provided for west Clare and the Kilrush ambulance station must be upgraded with extra staff and two permanent APTs in the station at all times. Ennis General Hospital is essential for life-saving and stabilising emergency care. This is been undermined and people’s lives been put at risk because there is no CAT scanner in the hospital. When a CAT scanner was approved for the hospital it was an outdated machine, not a 16 slice scanner as is required. Very little progress has been made in installing a scanner. I raised this matter in the Dáil last year. The centre of excellence in Limerick cannot cope with the extra number of patients who are arriving on their doorstep following the closure of some services at Ennis and Nenagh. The withdrawal of acute beds from Ennis and Nenagh will add 57% to Limerick’s acute bed numbers, if accident and emergency department closures proceed. With leaks emanating that accident and emergency services are also to close at St. John’s Hospital in Limerick, I question how are they going to cope with the extra numbers. A total of 5,000 people marched on the streets of Ennis last September to urge this Government to sit up and listen. The health service is a shambles in County Clare. The tactics of withdrawing by stealth services from County Clare with no alternative in place is unacceptable. In 2000, €20. 9 million was promised to develop Ennis. In 2005, five years later, the Minister announced the investment. This Government is great at turning sods and showing up for photoshoots. However, eight years on, there is no sod turning ceremony for Ennis and nothing but downgrading for the hospital. I am asking the Minister of State for a firm commitment that the €39 million promised to redevelop Ennis General Hospital will be given, no matter what the report on the acute health services recommends for the region.",Ahern

"I would like to raise a number of matters. It transpires that the HSE is confused about the request the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, made of it. We were told it was impossible to find out the number of children who may have died in the care of the State over the past decade but now we have been informed the figure will be available in the next two days. What has happened to ensure this information will be available in the next two days as it should have been in the first place, given the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children, who seems to have washed her hands of this matter entirely, and the Minister of State were unable to confirm the figure? Second, what progress has been made in regard to having the Attorney General approve the wording agreed by the all-party Oireachtas committee in respect of a referendum on children’s rights? Today’s Amnesty International report joins in the request that this matter be dealt with as quickly as possible. I respect the fact that we have to get the wording right. What progress has the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, made in giving his proposal to the Attorney General for confirmation to the Government in order that we can have the referendum? Third, the Government voted down a Fine Gael proposal last December to extend the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with the audit of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, which was supported by other parties in the House. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is now of the opinion that this should be so. Will that be done by regulation based on what he said yesterday or will it require primary legislation? If so, when will it come before the House? As Deputy Terence Flanagan has pointed out on a number of occasions in his role as spokesperson on housing, the number of people in mortgage arrears is increasing by 4,000 a month. What is the Government’s response in terms of a policy decision to deal with this serious matter for an increasing number of people? The current figure is 36,000 but it may go as high as 300,000.",Flanagan
"I thank my colleague, Deputy Jan O’Sullivan, for allowing me to intervene in this debate. I have seldom spoken on health matters because, quite frankly, I know very little about the medical side of health and I would hate to have to deal with the complexity of the problems in our system. Therefore, I do not propose to try in any way to second guess those who have put much more effort and consideration into these matters. I wish to offer some observations, from a personal point of view and from a constituency point of view. I will start with the HSE itself. I do not think any of us - certainly I did not - opposed the concept of the HSE at the time. However, I do not think any of those who vigorously proposed its establishment, including the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, and the present Minister, would ever have believed it would become the unmanageable monster it now is. In the course of that transition from inefficient and various health boards to what became an integrated single unit, the credibility of our ability in efficiency terms to deliver an efficient health service, or the perception of that — and frequently perception is more important than reality — is that it is a dysfunctional body. The Minister proposes to implement the Hollywood report and, as she stated to me in reply to a question in March 2007: It is my objective, and that of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and St. Luke’s Hospital to see the earliest delivery of the Government’s Plan for Radiation Oncology. I am determined that the HSE will deliver on this Plan in 2011 as originally scheduled. The HSE and my Department are considering options to speed up the pace of delivery. This is a challenging timetable and I will provide the HSE with the necessary support to deliver on it. As regards the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke’s Hospital, my objective is to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services. I will discuss this issue in due course with the HSE and the Hospital Board. At the time, that reply sent shockwaves and fear across the cancer community I encountered who visited St. Luke’s on a regular basis and among many of the residents who live there. I never encountered a resident in the Rathgar area who was worried or upset by the excessive car parking that took place on occasion or gave out about it. I never encountered a resident who felt his or her privacy or the tranquility of a residential area was marred or disrupted by people walking manifestly sick and dying relatives because of the haven of calm, to use the phrase referred to by Deputy Jan O’Sullivan, that was Rathgar and that still is St. Luke’s. Let me declare a personal interest. I am a graduate of cancer treatment and I can still remember, five years on, that extraordinary sense of total inner panic and fear that came right through me when my doctor said to me that one of the six sample tests which took place out in Tallaght was cancerous. The word 'cancer' for my generation has the same resonance as 'TB' for my parents’ generation. The health outcomes, as the Minister knows much better [628]than I do as she has the statistics to hand, are wonderfully positive. It is not the TB of our generation it is a curable disease. We know a great deal about what cures it but a framework and context in which those around one can be reassured is critically important. I had my full total body assessment after I went to the consultant when he told me that the first task was to find out if there was any cancer anywhere else in my system. I went through a long process. Going to St. Luke’s was like going to a religious retreat. It was not like going to accident and emergency in St. James’s. It was not like trying to find a parking place in the vicinity of St. James’s and then negotiating something akin to a bazaar in Istanbul to get to the right place. The best architecture in the world will not transform St. James’s into a place which will provide the sort of calm which already exists in St. Luke’s. In her speech and in the overall report that has been produced, I understand the Minister is bringing the facilities that were offered by St. Luke’s to the National Oncology Centre. I am sure the medical treatment will be of the best possible quality. I consulted with some colleagues in my constituency who are medical professionals and they said from a medical point of view the recommendations are the best, but we do not know everything about medicine. Our present standing in the world does not mean we are the most knowledgeable or that future cohorts of population and expertise will not discover anything new or different. We do not know what psychosomatic elements contribute to recovery from prostate cancer for some people and a failure to recover for others. In sports psychology the whole area of mind over matter is discernible and has been observed but given the limitations of science and knowledge it cannot be quantified. When I was a young athlete my coach gave me a book which described an incident in a garage in England. A man who was an athlete and had a young child had a Morris Minor up on a block. Something happened, the block shifted and the child was trapped under the car. The man let a roar out of him, bent down and lifted up the Morris Minor to save the child. When it was all over somebody asked him if he knew what he had just done. He said, 'No, is my kid all right?'. The person said, 'You have just lifted this car. Try and do it again'. Of course he could not. There are aspects of the human condition, physiology and emotional drive that we know about but cannot yet measure. I am putting to the Minister that what we know but cannot measure is the healing calm that is St. Luke’s. I respectfully suggest, with the comfort of ignorance because I am not a medical scientist, that there are components of the campus in St. Luke’s that provide that healing calm. After the diagnosis in my case, which took place in St. Luke’s, I had regular treatment. I cycled up to St. Vincent’s on the Merrion Road at 8 a. m., got my 15 minutes of treatment and came in here on the bus or by bicycle. It was in July five years ago. I was the lucky one because I was not very sick as they got it very early. Other people were receiving chemotherapy and serious radiotherapy and had to be driven from different parts of the country. I met people who flew down from Donegal. There is a string of bed and breakfasts on the Merrion Road which cater for outpatients of St. Vincent’s for that kind of thing. Where are they going to find that close to St. James’s? The Minister’s medical report examined the X-rays and the medical inputs. It is a one-dimensional world. They do not travel with a relative who has to come and stay in a bed and breakfast on the Merrion Road. I ask the people down the road to reconsider and not to throw out the healing haven which is there. I share the concerns of Deputy O’Sullivan regarding undertakings given in all good faith by the Minister, her colleague sitting beside her or the HSE. Things change and those guarantees cannot necessarily be honoured. They were not given dishonestly or in bad faith, but things [629]change. We know that ourselves in our personal and professional lives. In the answer the Minister gave to me as regards the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke’s she said her objective is to ensure the resources are utilised in the best interests of the health service. What does the health service need? More cash. What is the most valuable site in Dublin 6? St. Luke’s. It was a no-brainer in terms of making a decision to sell the site.",O'Sullivan
"I agree with the rationale put forward by Deputy Flanagan on this matter. We are discussing the partial exclusion of people from availing of the provisions of cohabitation based on marriage. In its consultation paper, the Law Reform Commission originally proposed to exclude all cohabiting relationships where one or both cohabitants is married to a third party. I understood the reasoning behind the commission’s view was that if the State, by its laws, were to recognise and improve the position of a cohabitee who is already married to somebody else those laws would undermine the constitutional institute of marriage. That was the reasoning the Minister gave on Committee Stage. The Law Reform Commission changed its view because it was criticised. In its report it changed its attitude and accepted it would not be appropriate to exclude married cohabitants. Although the Minister does not include a general exclusion in this subsection he has made a partial exclusion. The effect of the subsection is to remove from the definition of qualified cohabitant someone who lives with a person who may be long separated but not formally divorced from a former partner. They could be separated for four years, although not formally divorced. After four years, the Bill as proposed would be prepared to include such couples. It is my view that this will create unfairness and discrimination. [389]There is also a contradiction between subsections 4(a) and subsection 5, because subsection 5 implies that at least some married persons could be cohabitants, whereas subsection 4(a), taken in conjunction with subsection (1), implies that no married persons are cohabitants. My advice is that this constitutes an arbitrary and an unnecessarily complex set of exclusions. I hope the Minister reflects upon that.",Flanagan
I move: 'That the Bill be now read a Second Time.' I am very pleased to bring the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill 2010 to this House. I appreciate the co-operation of the House in agreeing to take this Bill at relatively short notice. I thank the Opposition for its understanding in this respect. I congratulate Deputy Shatter on his promotion to the position of spokesperson on justice. I am looking forward to having the same level of co-operation with him as I had with Deputy Flanagan.,Flanagan
"I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue again tonight. With other Deputies, I raised it in 2006 and we are forced to raise it again tonight. Effectively, Professor Brendan Drumm, who is the chief of the Health Service Executive, has given the two fingers to the Oireachtas Members of Cork North-Central and Cork South-Central. We all signed a letter, which was one of the few signed by all Deputies in both constituencies, in March last. We requested a meeting with him to discuss this serious issue and we have not even got a reply. That is accountability in the style of the Health Service Executive, which will go through another one in a series of charades of meeting public representatives — I intend no insult to the Ceann Comhairle who will chair a meeting next week — preaching to us and not giving us an opportunity to interact or to communicate properly. We sent a request, signed by all Oireachtas Members concerned, for a meeting but we received no response. That is why we must raise the issue here. No doubt I will be told tonight this is a matter for the Health Service Executive. Accountability has gone out the window. We do not know what is happening within senior management of the Health Service Executive. They are all promoting themselves. There are many managers but there is no management of the health services and we will not stand for that because the people of Cork deserve better. The parents of chronically sick children were forced to take to the footpaths of Cork University Hospital again this morning because of the situation, as outlined by Deputy Kathleen Lynch. I will not repeat much of the detail the Deputy has given. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, will not tolerate the attitude and the behaviour of Professor Drumm and his management team who seem to think that public representatives are just a crowd of nuisance makers. The Ceann Comhairle and I served on a health board for a number of years and we saw that on every item on the agenda, and even items that were not on the agenda, we could challenge and question management on the burning issues of the day. Now one cannot even get a response. A parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on 2 October was referred to the Health Service Executive and I have yet to get a reply on that urgent and important issue. [1189]In November 2006 there was need for a consultant paediatric endocrinologist, who has still not been appointed. There was need for a consultant paediatrician — there is a part-time one in place at present. There were supposed to be three clinical nurse specialist to help the 270 children, to whom Deputy Kathleen Lynch referred, but there is the equivalent of 1. 1. There is no dietitian, there is a half-time social worker and there is no dedicated clinical space. This matter has been rolling on for many years with no accountability and no real response. This issue is not being taken seriously. Cork and the southern area is out of touch totally with what is happening in the rest of the country in the treatment of child diabetes. This should not continue. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, who is representing the Minister for Health and Children, to carry out a departmental investigation into the mismanagement of this entire affair by Professor Drumm who, as I stated, is giving the two fingers to Oireachtas Members by not even responding to a request for a meeting where we could discuss with him and his many highly paid managers this ongoing burning issue. He should be brought to task for non-performance, despite his large bonus, and his contempt, not for public representatives but for the parents and sick children of the greater Cork area.",Lynch
"I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Denis Naughten — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline her plans for the provision of acute medical and surgical care of the people of Roscommon, Galway, Westmeath, Longford, Leitrim and Offaly, following the HSE decision to close the inpatient surgery and accident departments at Roscommon County Hospital and transfer them to Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe, on an interim basis (2) Deputy Michael D. Higgins — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline her plans for the provision of acute medical and surgical care of the people of Roscommon, Galway, Westmeath, Longford, Leitrim and Offaly, following the HSE decision to close the inpatient surgery and accident departments at Roscommon County Hospital and transfer them to Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe, on an interim basis (3) Deputy Ulick Burke — the need to include in the proposed new intoxicating liquor Bill a section that will ban the sale in Ireland of the highly potent and exclusively designed shot packs (4) Deputy Frank Feighan — the need for a person in County Roscommon to receive radio iodine ablasion treatment (5) Deputy Pat Breen — the issue of the proposed Carrigaholt sewerage scheme in County Clare, if the Minister would provide an update on the present situation, when the Minister expects to have the preliminary report for the scheme approved and the timeframe for this project going to tender (6) Deputy Noel J. Coonan — the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline what plans her Department has in place to provide alternative employment for the employees of the former Erin Foods factory in Thurles, what plans her Department has to attract industry and investment to the town, and to outline how many jobs have been created in Thurles town since a delegation from the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment visited there in January (7) Deputy Joe Carey — the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that water supplied to the public under the water services investment programme is clean and wholesome (8) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for Transport to provide an up-date on his plans regarding the reopening of Killucan railway station, County Westmeath and the provision of structural fund financing for same, in the light of the urgent need for easily accessible public transport, due to the rapidly increasing population in the area (9) Deputy Ciarán Lynch — the need to address the gynaecological service provided by Cork University Maternity Hospital (10) Deputy Charles Flanagan — the need for a strategy to resolve the issues of outstanding warrants and execution orders (11) Deputy Olwyn Enright — that Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Health and Children to outline Government policy on the provision of day care services in Laois-Offaly, how much funding has been allocated to the HSE for the service in this area this year, and whether this is sufficient to ensure that the service remains available on the same basis as every other year (12) Deputy Michael McGrath — that every possible step be taken to resolve the current Iarnród Éireann dispute affecting the Cork-Dublin train services (13) Deputy Dan Neville — the siting of the Central Mental Hospital at Thornton Hall (14) Deputy Tom Hayes — to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss the funding of a sewerage scheme in Golden, County Tipperary, to confirm what the delay is in allocating a sewerage scheme for this area (15) Deputy David Stanton — to ask the Minister for Transport to debate the rail service dispute which has led to the cancellation of trains and service disrup[453]tion over the last six days, leading to serious inconvenience to passengers and the public generally (16) Deputy Fergus O’Dowd — to discuss an issue of urgent national importance namely the need for a no strike clause in essential transport services as a result of the effect of the unofficial strike in Irish Rail thus causing mayhem and disruption for thousands of passengers and adversely affecting the economy and showing no regard whatsover to the travelling public and the taxpayer and (17) Deputy Martin Ferris — the effect of rising fuel prices on Irish fishermen. The matters raised by Deputies Frank Feighan, Ciarán Lynch, Ulick Burke and Charles Flanagan have been selected for discussion.",Lynch
"I should have six minutes. Deputy McHugh did not go two minutes over time. The reason we have some information in regard to the Milliman report is Fine Gael’s tabling of this motion. The Minister has had the Milliman report since September, yet she only told us about it in the House yesterday. She gave us a little snap-shot of it and stated she will release the remainder of it, with the commercial information redacted. We have little to be grateful for. Deputy Conlon spoke about the wonders of the medical assessment unit in Cavan General Hospital. While I welcome that unit, there were, according to the IMNO, 45 people lying on trolleys at that unit today. Some 32 people were lying on trolleys today in Tallaght hospital. A total of 444 people were lying on trolleys today in hospitals throughout the country. Many people are not on trolleys but are sitting on plastic chairs with drips hanging out of them while waiting for admission. This is relevant to the VHI. It is a fear of not being able to access the service which encourages people to take out insurance. The Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, continually muddies the waters saying that the service is excellent. The service is excellent if one can access it. The quality of care in the country is also excellent if one can access it. However, there is a lack of access in both regards. My colleague, Deputy Ring, spoke of a lady with cancer who is waiting for an operation. A colleague informed me today that a public patient who had a scan in November, following which he was diagnosed with cancer and now requires a further scan, will not get that scan until February. That person and his family were left to worry about this all over Christmas, which is unacceptable and is no way to treat people in a modern society. The proposed VHI increases are horrendous. They are a kick in the teeth to people. I believe it is the VHI telling the Government to get up off its rear end and bring in risk equalisation. A 45% increase on top of increases of 48% over the previous four years clearly makes VHI insurance unaffordable for people. The Minister’s failure to introduce risk equalisation is a disgrace. She told us in 2008 that it would take her three years to do so and that in the meantime she would introduce a levy. That levy has resulted in an increase in the cost of insurance for younger people, pushing 70,000 of them out of the market. The VHI is now proposing to hit the very people it is supposed to be protecting, namely, older clients who have remained loyal to it for, in many cases, 40 years. The VHI is now running a campaign in relation to its provision of free insurance for children. I am told this is costing in the region of €9 million. Consequently, older people will be subsidising younger people rather than the reverse, which was previously the policy. Furthermore, the Minister told us this was revenue neutral, that there was no gain to the Exchequer. The Exchequer got €13 million last year and stands to get another €23 million this year, which amounts to €36 million. So much for spin. This contravenes the Minister’s policy on community rating. I was told today that 50 beds are not open at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Raheny, which is an overflow for Beaumont Hospital and could alleviate some of the problems there. There are 26 people lying on trolleys or sitting on chairs in the accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital, yet these beds in St. Joseph’s Hospital remain unopen. Deputy Collins berated the IMNO for releasing daily figures on trolley-watch. Why would they not do so when they have to listen day-in and day-out to HSE spin that only half a particular number of people are trolleys, with many people as I stated earlier sitting on chairs and in distress? Deputy Byrne stated that our universal health insurance is flawed. There may be some tweaking to be done in that regard but what is certain is the current system is deeply flawed. It is broken and is not delivering for people. [124]The VHI has not sought — the Minister has not sought to encourage it to do so — to provide chronic illness care in the community, which would allow people be treated in their communities, or to offer a great range of diagnostics to general practitioners so they can diagnose and treat in the community. Very little prevention takes place in the community and health insurance companies are doing little in that regard. They may have plans. The Minister stated last night there will be further plans on this, she would like to see a bit of that and she will do the other. This is more of her modus operandi— plans for tomorrow instead of action today — while the people suffer day in, day out. Our economy is wrecked with 440,000 people out of work and young people haemorrhaging out of the country with more making the decision to emigrate. Even more of them will probably leave after yesterday’s decision by Fianna Fáil to retain the Taoiseach as its leader. He should go to the country and give people hope. We should have an election. Apart from that, there should be control from Government. The Minister is the principal shareholder in the VHI and she can instruct the board not to implement the increases in charges until there has been a proper debate and an examination of the costs the organisation incurs. As other colleagues have pointed out, bills are paid in many instances without being questioned and no attempt is made to reduce the cost of medical care, despite the company operating as a monopoly for almost 50 years. I ask the Minister again to consider those who are responsible for building the country and bringing us the Celtic tiger era. They are in the latter years of their lives and, despite their loyalty and all the pain they endured, they will find they cannot afford health insurance, which would give them comfort during years in which they know their medical need will increase. I commend the motion to the House. Amendment put. The Dáil divided: Tá, 76 Níl, 74. Tellers: Tá, Deputies John Cregan and John Curran Níl, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe.

"I remind the Tánaiste and the Government that at the time of the flooding of the Tolka in my constituency the Red Cross was heavily involved at the invitation of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. That worked very successfully and I would recommend it to the Government in regard to relief in terms of the current floods. Many people are not used to going to community welfare officers. The Red Cross was very flexible and fast in its response on that occasion. The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, would also know that. Has the Minister any proposals to review the arrangements in respect of the aviation regulator? There are approximately 700 Irish people abroad at the moment with Budget Travel. The people in Egypt are having a great difficulty——",Carey

Deputy Lynch has made his point.,Lynch
"I commend Deputy Brian Hayes for tabling this important motion. The review of SNAs being undertaken by the NCSE is having a huge impact in my constituency, Tipperary South. Pupils with special needs and other pupils in their classrooms have been affected by the removal of much needed supports. I refer, in particular, to Ballingarry national school, St. Patrick’s, Ballylooby and St. John the Baptist’s in Cashel in the constituency. However, I would like to instance the craziness of this issue in Fethard, County Tipperary, where an SNA earning €225 a week was notified a few weeks ago that she was not needed anymore. She was put on a FÁS scheme to be trained as a secretary for which she is earning €280 a week. The country is full of redundant and unemployed secretaries but this lady was working as an SNA and costing the State much less. That is crazy and unacceptable and this is what is wrong. As Deputy Barrett said, if the needs of those who need only a small helping hand were met, it would be of huge benefit to them when they attend secondary school. The value of this support cannot be calculated and it is deplorable that the Government can stand over these cutbacks. The country is not broke. Billions of euro were found yesterday to give to the banks. The Government has plenty of money to waste left, right and centre. Shame on us to allow a Government to stand over a situation in a society that we are supposed to be proud of where children with special needs have to beg for basic help and education.",Hayes
"I thank the almost 11,000 people who voted No. 1 for me and those who gave me their second preference in this election. I appreciate this vote of confidence and thank all those who helped. I also congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his appointment to what is an extremely important job. I hope he will be, as he stated, unbiased. I congratulate the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on his third term in office. I also congratulate him on the peace in Northern Ireland. While all Members worked towards that goal, he was its spearhead and all Members welcome it. I also welcome the incoming Tánaiste to his post. However, this is a different Government. As some Members have already noted, given what has been said in recent weeks and months, it is hard to reconcile how this Government can come together. I clearly remember the Minister for Finance’s comments about the Greens and the damage they would do. When matters became tough in my constituency, the issue raised was that Fine Gael would need the support of the Greens to enter Government, which it was said would not work as farmers would be destroyed. As five of the six Green Party Deputies are from Dublin, I hope the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, the Taoiseach and all others——",Ahern
"On promised legislation in the justice area, the Money Laundering Bill has been promised for some time. Given the need for that legislation, I ask the Taoiseach to indicate whether it is likely to be included in the priority list to which he referred in his earlier reply to Deputy Charlie Flanagan. On the issue of the transfer of assets from the ESB to EirGrid, what is the likelihood of that Bill being electrified and brought through the House before the summer recess?",Flanagan
"The Hayes Report makes detailed constructive recommendations about the operation of specific services in the hospital and all of these will be implemented. Following its publication, I met with Dr. Hayes to discuss the implications of his report. I have also had discussions with the Chair of Tallaght Hospital and the CEO of the HSE about the report. Their main focus is on what initiatives are needed both in the hospital and in the wider health system to provide sustained improvements in the services for patients. An additional 2 locum consultant radiologists were appointed to the hospital in January 2010 to assist in dealing with the backlog of X-rays. The backlog has been cleared. On 7 September 2010 the HSE issued formal approval to Tallaght Hospital to appoint two new consultant radiologists. This is in line with the recommendations of the Hayes Report. The interviews took place in late 2010 with an expected start date for the successful candidates as soon as possible in 2011. The Hayes Report recommended that consultant radiologist staffing levels should be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate to the work load in each radiology department. The HSE is committed to carrying out a review of consultant radiologist staffing levels in hospitals and to strengthening workforce planning across all radiology departments. The review will be informed by the results of a survey of consultant radiologist staffing which is currently being undertaken by the Faculty of Radiology. This report is awaited. [278]Since 2005 there has been a 34% national increase in the numbers of consultant radiologists, from 183 to 245. Ireland now has a ratio of 1 consultant radiologist per 17,959 population, which is similar to the UK at 1 per 18,040 per population. The HSE is fully committed to implementing the recommendations of the Hayes report in the shortest possible timeframe. I am confident that adopting this approach will help ensure the provision of a timely and quality radiology service in Tallaght Hospital.",Hayes

"I join with colleagues in wishing Deputies Pat Carey, Tony Killeen and John Curran well in their new portfolios and I congratulate my colleagues, Deputies Seán Connick, Mary Alexandra White and Ciarán Cuffe on their new appointments. I look forward to working with them. I thank the Taoiseach for assigning me extra responsibilities and I look forward to working with him and the Minister for Finance on the transformation of the public service, which is one of the key challenges facing the Government in the coming months and years. We can have a public service that will make a highly significant contribution to sustainable economic recovery and renewal. We need a public service that is better integrated to meet the needs of citizens, that is fit for purpose and affordable. We must renew our focus on what is achieved and how we can improve outcomes across the public service, while simultaneously focusing on reducing the cost of doing business, not just for Government but for citizens interacting. Doing more for less is not just [53]an economic imperative, it presents us with the opportunity to reconfigure how public services are delivered and to re-engineer processes across the Government system, in agreement with those who work in it. Our policy priorities in economic and social policy areas are clearly set out in the revised programme for Government and in other key policy frameworks published in the last 12 months. No one doubts what needs to be achieved and the critical task now is to drive the implementation of those policies. The ongoing pressure on resources means that progress is essential and urgent. The citizen must be at the centre of everything the public service does. We want to remove barriers between different branches of the public service and different organisations to make sure there is clarity of purpose, a stronger leadership and better co-operation. We need a more joined-up Government to respond to the joined-up needs of our people as they live their lives and look after their families. The emphasis must be on the citizen. We want to see an ongoing expansion in the services available on-line to the individual and particularly to businesses. We have to apply new technology, some of which has been developed within the public service, to boost productivity and improve customer service. We also need to share information more widely across the system and in the process reduce the burden placed on citizens and businesses. To achieve our objectives here it will be necessary to make strategic investments in innovative technologies and to acquire specialist skills which may not be currently available. There must be a major reshaping of how we manage our public service. We have to re-engineer the way we do business so that the various components of our services are delivered in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible. One important opportunity to do this is through developing shared services which achieve economies of scale and the opportunity to innovate and streamline procedures, which will be a particular focus of mine in the coming weeks. There are many examples of how this approach to managing standardised procedures could generate very substantial savings, without compromising standards. In particular, I look forward to working closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh on public procurement reform, especially with small and medium sized enterprises. The key element in the public service are the people. The greatest asset of our public service are those who work in it every day delivering diverse and varied services to each citizen. They have a commitment which I want to harness and a knowledge and professionalism which I want to use to reshape our public services, in agreement with them, to ensure they are efficient, effective and focused on our people. Progress has been made on the reform agenda in recent times. We must now dramatically accelerate that reform. Current discussions between the public service management and unions are being facilitated by Mr. Kevin Duffy and Mr. Kieran Mulvey. All parties must engage in this process in good faith. This is the appropriate forum for all of us to direct our energies and opinions at the current time. It is clear to me that there is a shared view on the sort of changes across the public service that would produce greater efficiency and better services for the public and more satisfactory working conditions for public servants. We now need to reach a realistic and fair agreement so that we can move on with the priorities of transformation. The public interest and the long-term interest of public servants coincide with those of the Government and our citizens in creating a public service of which we can be proud and, equally, a public service which we can afford. There is much hard work and challenges ahead but I look forward to working with public servants right across the system and with stakeholders in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance.",Carey
"I was struck by the point Deputy Shatter made about the emphasis there has been in this House on NAMA and on how we could bring forward such complex legislation so quickly. Understandably, there has been a huge concentration in this House in the past year and a half on economic matters. That is the climate we were in. However, we need to spend a lot more time looking not just at how we want the country to run economically but how we want the country to be and how we want society to behave. The biggest measure of any civil society is how we treat our most vulnerable and by any standard our children are the most vulnerable people in society. The Government is failing them by not holding the referendum. I welcome the motion tabled by the Labour Party and Sinn Féin. It is simply seeking a date for a referendum. That is not a lot to ask. I appreciate that there is a level of complexity involved. I was a member of the committee. With Deputy Howlin, I was also a member of the [291]previous committee that reported in 2007. Sometimes I am amused at how Government operates. The Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, was on the committee. His predecessor, the then Minister of State, Deputy Smith, was on the committee and his predecessor, the then Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was on the previous committee. The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, was on the previous committee and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, sometimes attended the most recent committee. They were involved. They knew what was going on. Following meetings where it was decided complex areas would be discussed Fine Gael Party members met as a group, as did members of the Labour Party and Sinn Féin. I am not sure what the Green Party did but Fianna Fáil Party members met as a group. Discussions were held and parties formulated their positions prior to us arriving at our conclusion. The third report had all-party agreement. On several occasions, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, went back to the Attorney General for clarification, which means the latter also knew what was going on. It is not as if a report suddenly landed on a desk in February without anyone’s knowledge or that Departments are being asked to deal with a new issue. I am surprised that it was the Minister for Health and Children who presented a copy of the committee’s report to the Cabinet in March because I would have assumed the Minister of State has more expertise from being on the committee. This referendum is part of a process of reforming our law and enforcing the legislation that is already in place to protect children. As a member of the committee, I can understand to an extent the Minister of State’s comment that the emphasis of tonight’s debate is on child protection when many other issues are set out in the report. However, it is difficult for us to refrain from emphasising child protection when the system is so appalling and lets children down so badly. The other issues are also extremely important but do not call for the same degree of urgency. The Government’s approach, however, reveals a worrying lack of urgency. We respond to tragedies with debates but then there is silence until another tragedy occurs. Today’s tragedy, unfortunately, involved Daniel McAnaspie. In three months’ time there will be another sad case involving a child or young adult and we will have another discussion. When are we going to see action? In his third report, the Government’s rapporteur, Geoffrey Shannon, identified a number of significant problems. We still do not have independent oversight of child protection services, a system of inquiring into fundamental failings or consistent application of the Children First guidelines. Mr. Shannon also recommended a review of our current child protection system. Why is that work not being done? We have spoken about a system that is bursting at the seams. The system is not working. A child was murdered today and another 20 died in care over the past decade. A HSE representative stated on radio this morning that 5,600 children are in care. Twenty out of 5,600 children is a significant proportion. How many are missing and why is a distinction being drawn between Irish children who go missing in State care and the other children who come into this country to be exploited? Are the latter regarded as less important? When something happens, we call it a systemic failure as if it was a computer glitch or human error. A systemic failure means the system is broken and needs to be changed. I will outline an example of how parts of the system do not communicate with each other. A family in my area fostered an extremely troubled child and wanted to stick by him even though he became a danger to the family. His social worker did a lot to help, despite the lack of an out-of-hours service, but the child needed a place in a special school. The school would not take the child unless the National Educational Psychological Service would agree to provide the necessary [292]services but the latter would not agree to provide the services unless he was placed in the school. He ended up back in full-time care at enormous cost to the State when he would have been better off in a family environment. The Minister of State argued that it is unfair to accuse the Government of tardiness on vetting. Fine Gael first raised the issue of vetting in this House in 2003. The Government was toing and froing on whether we needed a referendum until committees were established to investigate the issue. It is far too late to be announcing legislation seven years later. Furthermore, as Deputy Shatter noted, this legislation continues to languish on section C of the legislative programme after being transferred between three Departments since 2003. The church has asked experts from the North, such as Mr. Elliott, to advise it. When will legislation in this area be published? Every day we wait, we put more children at risk.",Lenihan
"I challenge any Member to meet the so-called high standards applied by the so-called Opposition. It is interesting that some of the matters involving the Opposition are conveniently ignored.

"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. In terms of general principles, it is in everybody’s interests that clear accountability be established in health policy. We have all suffered from a lack of definition in the transfer of responsibilities from Parliament to the Health Service Executive. I recall a paper delivered by former EU Commissioner with responsibility for health, Mr. David Byrne, to the Law Society in University College Dublin, in which he discussed the issue of the transfer of responsibilities. Mr. Byrne suggested that democracy and the Constitution required a clear policy envelope on the occasion of the transfer of powers, for which accountability resides in Parliament, to the Health Service Executive. While it is not my intention to knock people who have been trying their best, the performance of the HSE in delivering accountability in health policy has been insufficient. Professor Drumm recently offered to meet parliamentarians to discuss how the executive could be more accountable. The 8. 30 a. m. meetings in the audiovisual room are regarded by all those who attend them as a complete waste of time.",Byrne
"I propose to take Questions 124 and 141 together. Over a period of several months, I have been involved in intensive efforts with my British counterpart, Shaun Woodward, to assist and encourage the Northern Ireland parties to complete the devolution of policing and justice and to address other outstanding aspects of the St. Andrews Agreement that still require implementation. Towards the end of last month, it became clear that the parties themselves were unable to agree on how to move ahead. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister met in London on 25 January and decided to travel directly to Hillsborough where they convened all party talks. During the course of those talks, which concluded on Friday, 5 February, I met with the leaders of all of the political parties in Northern Ireland and with members of their Assembly Groups. We worked hard to establish common ground, to build dialogue between the parties, and to re-establish the trust necessary to complete the devolution of policing and justice in Northern Ireland. On 5 February, the DUP and Sinn Féin finalised a comprehensive agreement which will ensure that policing and justice powers will be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly by 12 April of this year. The agreement also includes provisions to identify a Justice Minister, who will be a full member of the Executive, and to expand the Programme for Government to take account of the work of the new Department of Justice. The agreement reached is extremely significant and will complete the process of devolution as envisaged in the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements. Devolution of policing will allow Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, who have a clear understanding of the needs of the community, to identify the best local solutions to local problems. This will make government more accessible and accountable. The evil, criminal attack on PSNI Constable Peadar Heffron and recent attacks on police stations are a stark reminder that there remains a tiny minority intent on destroying all that has been achieved. The best response to give to such people is the early implementation of the agreement reached on devolving policing and justice, thereby securing the stability of the devolved institutions, and showing that the democratic political institutions are delivering for all of the people of Northern Ireland. At Hillsborough, the parties also agreed to develop an improved framework to regulate and adjudicate on public assemblies and parades. A working group, set up by the First and deputy First Ministers, will bring forward agreed outcomes on parading issues. These will feed into the preparation of draft legislation on parading. Following a period of public consultation on a proposed Bill, it is intended that legislation will be in place by the end of 2010. As the agreement announced by the parties makes clear, the aim is to bring forward agreed outcomes which can achieve cross community support. Any improved framework agreed will be based on the core principle of local people providing local solutions, with respect for the rights of those who parade and those who live in areas through which they seek to parade. Given the history of parading and the potential it has to destabilise communities, this agreement between the parties has the potential to transform the situation. The Parades Commission will continue to operate until new arrangements are agreed and in place. During the talks, agreement was also reached on improving the functioning of the Executive and on clearing outstanding Executive business. This will enable the Executive to get back to work in a spirit of genuine partnership. The First and deputy First Minister are also tasked with looking at all areas from the St. Andrews Agreement which are yet to be implemented. [344]The Government welcomes the agreement to set up an Executive working group to identify how progress can be made on these outstanding issues, including the key issue of the protection and promotion of the Irish language and implementing the other outstanding North/South commitments from St. Andrews. Both Governments will continue to encourage, and work with, the parties to ensure that all aspects of the agreement reached on 5 February, together with outstanding issues from the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews, are implemented. This agreement provides the basis for the stable and sustained functioning of the devolved institutions into the future, in a renewed spirit of partnership to deliver success for the entire community.",Andrews

It has initiated legislation not just in this area but also in the area of white collar crime, etc. It is up to the State agencies, the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement to prosecute under the legislation for which they are responsible. If we pass this Bill, it will not be the Government that will be prosecuting anyone but the Garda. The Deputy should not try to suggest otherwise. Comments made by Deputies on this Bill have been measured in the sense that, while the Government is amenable to making amendments thereto, it must obviously do so in the context of the parameters laid down under the Dillon case. As I stated previously, there are some who feel this legislation is not going far enough. Equally, there are those who feel it is going too far and that we should not be legislating in this area at all. Deputy Clune referred to the fact that some of the tourism bodies have not raised this issue with her. When I was in Paris on St. Patrick’s Day duty, I was lobbied at a function promoting Ireland as a tourism destination by some Irish organisations that were plying for business on [44]the basis that this legislation was not going far enough. We must strike a balance and I believe we have done so. Deputy Ó Snodaigh suggested there are ways around this legislation, such as providing something as a quid pro quo for the money received. Equally, there is ample opportunity for people to beg and stay within the law because we made it clear that, under the Dillon judgment, we cannot ban begging entirely. Under the judgment we cannot ban begging entirely and under the freedom of expression provision in the Constitution, we must allow that people are entitled to beg, provided they do it within the law and in a reasonable way. There are others who feel that no one should be entitled to beg and that there is no need for anyone to beg because we have excellent State services and supports and NGO supports. It is, however, a social reality and we must deal with it legislatively and in terms of assistance. I acknowledge the contributions made by voluntary organisations, many of which are supported by public funding in the work they do, to provide assistance to those who feel the need to beg. Equally, I have a duty as Minister to discharge my responsibility to preserve public order. That is what this Bill is termed, it is specific public order legislation to deal with a public order problem, namely, aggressive begging. Some Deputies asked about public places. The definition of a public place is contained in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. A public place includes a highway and any outdoor area where there is access and that is used for public recreational purposes. Deputy Johnny Brady asked about begging around a church. In the 1994 Act there is a reference to a public place including any cemetery or churchyard. It also includes any train, vessel or vehicle where the carriage of persons is for reward and any premises or other place where the general public has a right to go to or would go there for a payment. That would include concerts and places where people congregate, such as football matches. If there is any further scope when we go into the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage, I will agree to some amendments if we can tailor them. A number of Deputies raised the issue of begging interfering with normal social and commercial activity. The Department has received a considerable number of representations from groups including IBEC, the Business Association of Ireland, the Cork Business Association, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Dublin City Centre Business Association on the need for this legislation. We have also received correspondence from Oireachtas Members exhorting us to deal with this problem and, equally, have received representations from members of the public. I was at a football match recently where a man asked me to deal with the situation in Dundalk, where there was a suggestion that a non-national was begging to such an extent that €2,000 a week was mentioned. That is ultimately an issue for the Garda but it shows the public is exercised by this. Deputy Rabbitte asked about the additional statistics on begging. Recorded incidents in 2003 numbered 961, in 2004 there were 575, in 2005 there were 891, in 2006 there were 605, in 2007 there were 461, in 2008 there were 30 and since then virtually none. That is a result of the Dillon decision, which meant the Garda no longer proceeded on the basis of the Vagrancy Act. I was asked about the use of children to beg by Deputy Joe Carey. Section 247 of the Children Act 2001 is not concerned with children begging but with those who procure and control children for the purpose of begging. The numbers show a similar pattern in the opposite direction of the recorded begging incidence. In 2003 there were six such incidents, in 2004 there were four, in 2005 there were two, in 2006 there was one and then in 2007 there were 75 and in 2008 there were 124. This section was used more often than before because of the Dillon judgment. [45]Deputy Rabbitte mentioned that the penalty under section 247 was low compared to the levels proposed in this Bill. The maximum fine for a first offence is €250, with a fine of €500 for subsequent offences in this Bill. The fines under the other Act will be upgraded by the Fines Act under the indexation provisions. There would not, there, be much difference ultimately. The involvement of foreign nationals was raised and there is concern in this regard. My wife and I recently witnessed a situation in Dundalk that brought to mind the purpose of this legislation. A non-national lady was begging, not in an aggressive way but it could have turned aggressive quickly because of the nature of the conversation with the people she was begging from. The people involved were quite upset afterwards. If this legislation is passed, it would be difficult to ground a prosecution because it could not be said the lady, and I witnessed this, was being aggressive but it could have turned aggressive and could have been very nasty within seconds. Perhaps on Committee Stage we could look at this again within the parameters of the Dillon judgment. Deputy Rabbitte asked about the Human Rights Commission and we were pleased to be able to accommodate a number of points it made, some of which I mentioned in my speech. He also referred to the submission from Barnardo’s, which echoed the statement from the Human Rights Commission and which we took on board. It stated that begging in itself should not be criminalised but the Bill recognises that begging cannot be banned because of the court decision. Deputy Joe Carey asked about the report of the Law Reform Commission on vagrancy. In the Dillon case, the High Court referred favourably to that report and many of the proposals referred to have been enacted in subsequent legislation: the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. While people make the political point that we should not be addressing this Bill, that we should look after 'bigger' criminals, I do not accept that we are not passing the required legislation to allow the State authorities to prosecute those people. We have made it clear that if other legislation is required in that area, the Government is more than amenable to bringing such legislation forward. The fact we are dealing with one area does not mean to say we completely ignore other areas. It is safe to say that given so many people have spoken in the House about begging on Second Stage, and that so many Members have raised these issues with me, it was right to introduce this Bill. I look forward to the more forensic examination of these issues as the Bill passes through Committee Stage and Report Stage in this House. Question put and agreed to.",Brady
"I hope we will not be told the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is in charge.",Lenihan
"There are no offices and so on attached to the position of cultural ambassador. The new ambassador will work closely with the Government, with Culture Ireland and [18]with artistic bodies to develop a vision that is inclusive of the Irish diaspora throughout the world. It is about how we can promote culture on its own intrinsic merit to expand the footprint of the country worldwide, so that people can know who and what we are. There are also economic ties to culture, such as cultural events and the impact they make. There are many prominent Irish people involved in the cultural life of many societies around the world. The US contains a huge part of the business of culture, otherwise known as the entertainment industry. Mr. Gabriel Byrne is somebody who can assist Ireland in that respect. He will work with Culture Ireland and with artistic bodies. He will be involved in trying to make sure that we assist in funding for the new arts theatre in New York. There is a range of issues involved, but it is open for Mr. Byrne to use those issues. These bodies will work with him on how to use his personage as a means of promoting our country and our culture in the US and elsewhere. He may not be our only cultural ambassador in the future, as others might be of assistance as well. It provides an outlet for the diaspora to contribute in a meaningful way to modern Ireland. The second question was on fiscal issues. On my first meeting with President Obama last year, he made it clear when I raised this issue — and perhaps it was more current, not long after his inauguration — that he does not regard Ireland as being among the countries that he would have in mind. He was talking about those where people name-plate their operations and use such jurisdictions for fiscal purposes. That is an issue which is not only a matter of policy development or an ultimate decision for the President, but also for Congress. Therefore there would be a considerable legislative process to be considered as to how all that would work out. We will be in close touch with senators and members of Congress, including the Friends of Ireland group who will be of assistance to us in that respect as well, to ensure that there is a clear understanding of Ireland’s position. We are totally compliant regarding all international tax treaties. It is not well known by some who do not know how the relationship has developed, particularly the economic relationship, so we will also use the opportunity to emphasise the level of cross-investment between Irish-owned companies in the United States which, in terms of employment, practically mirrors the level of employment of US companies here. That fact is not even well known, understood or appreciated at home, let alone abroad. There are 227 Irish companies with operations in the United States, employing more than 81,000 people across 2,630 US locations. That gives an indication of just how changed the relationship is in terms of an industrial, manufacturing and services presence in the United States by Irish companies. We are currently the 13th largest investor in the United States with cumulative investments valued at approximately $34 billion. The US is Ireland’s largest services trading partner, and our second largest merchandise trading partner. Taken together, that trade was valued at $50. 5 billion in 2008. Therefore the economic relationship between the United States and Ireland is one of significant two-way trade and investment that generates jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. We see ourselves as representing the perfect gateway for US industry to the European market. Getting those messages across in the context of how people view Ireland is an important part of the discussion and interaction we will have, not only with President Obama and his administration’s officials but also with Congress. Despite last year’s difficult trading conditions, 47 Irish companies opened up operations in the United States. There is a huge opportunity for us there, even in the current difficult circumstances. As we move out of recession and as world trading conditions improve, the diverse nature of Irish trade in America is an important factor in our recovery.",Byrne
"I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter, an important one for Ballygarvan, County Cork. The need for a new national school building in Ballygarvan was accepted by the Department of Education and Skills in the late 1990s. Enrolment at the school has expanded in recent years while conditions in the existing buildings are substandard with an over reliance on expensive prefab accommodation. There is also a lack of space for recreational and play areas for the children. The Department approved a 16-classroom school to be built on a green-field site. The project, however, was bedevilled by the need to secure a suitable site. Although three separate land parcels with three separate owners comprised the preferred site, after enormous work by the local community, its public representatives and the Department the site was secured. The then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, who also had served the constituency as a Deputy, approved the appointment of a design team and the project progressed through the various planning stages. It was then put out to tender. The school was to be constructed using a modular build model in a five-month timescale. The preferred bidder for the school building project is McInerney Holdings but it went into interim examinership recently. I hope it will be in a position to fulfil its contract with this building and begin construction as soon as possible. The community in Ballygarvan wants to know the status of the project and if the preferred bidder will be able to proceed. If this were not to be the case, will the project have to be retendered or can the Department select the next bidder from the original tender process? The local community also wants funding for the project to be confirmed. If construction proceeded, it would be a great boost to this close-knit community which has fund-raised for many years for a new school building. Will the Minister of State give some indication as to when construction on site will begin and a reassurance the project is going ahead?",O'Keeffe
"I thank Deputies for their contributions and constructive comments in respect of this matter. I also thank them for their pledged support for the motion. A number of issues were raised. Deputy Brian Hayes referred to the role played by the Department of Education and Science in 2002 and subsequently. Mr. Matthias Kelly was appointed by the then Minister in 2003 to review the Department’s processes and procedures relating to the making of discoveries by it to the commission. Mr. Kelly’s interim report reached the conclusion that 'the difficulties over discovery were not due to obstruction or concealment but rather due to poor historic record storage systems and misunderstandings as to what in fact was required'. Deputies Brian Hayes, Quinn, Shatter, Connaughton, Durkan and Naughten referred to the current situation and the situation that will obtain in the future. In many respects, this motion deals with past events. A number of topics were raised in this regard, including that of child protection guidelines. The Department issued guidelines, in line with the Children First policy document, to primary and post-primary schools in respect of dealing with and reporting child abuse. The Department has also provided training to designated liaison persons on the implementation of these guidelines as part of a range of measures, including the Stay Safe programme, relating to child protection. I will be happy to provide Deputies with details of this training if required. Deputies Brian Hayes and Quinn also referred to child protection procedures in general. Having regard to the future, the Department will conduct a review of its procedures in light of the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the review of Children First and the national child protection guidelines and in the event of the ratification of the referendum relating to children. This is an ongoing concern to the Department of Education and Science. [264]I thank Deputies O’Rourke and Neville for their caring and compassionate insight in the cases we are dealing with. Both clearly have an intimate knowledge of these cases and have interacted with the people who have come before the commission. They brought an insight into the human tragedy that all this involves. The issue of vetting was raised by Deputies Brian Hayes and Shatter. Special arrangements for newly-qualified teachers are co-ordinated through the teaching council. Currently, existing teachers are not vetted but the Department is working with the appropriate authorities to consider how best to put the appropriate arrangements in place as the roll-out of the Garda vetting unit expands. Irrespective of the position on vetting, where facts are brought to the information of the school, the school must be vigilant, check references and probe any gaps in records. I probably do not have time to go into the indemnity agreements now but the decision to establish the redress scheme was made regardless of whether the religious congregations would contribute to the cost. The State had a duty to make amends for the abuse of children placed in institutions by the courts. Nevertheless it was considered desirable that the congregations should make a meaningful contribution and agreement was reached on the provision of €128 million. At the beginning of the negotiations, the Department of Finance had recommended that the negotiating team should strive for a 50% contribution from the congregations. However, it was subsequently recognised that this was not achievable and the Department of Finance was satisfied with the contribution of €120 million. I commend the motion to the House. Question put and agreed to.",Hayes
"I welcome the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009. The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide a good quality cost-efficient public bus passenger transport service for the people of the country. To effect that vision, the Government believes there is a need to examine the licensing regime that exists and examining it clearly shows a necessity to reform it. The Bill sets out the framework to facilitate regulated competition in the public bus passenger service. Despite what the previous speaker, Deputy James Bannon, stated, the Bill builds upon knowledge and experience gained from other jurisdictions which sought to liberalise the market. I was taken by the comments he made and by the position put forward by Fine Gael which seems to involve liberalisation or absolute deregulation in the bus market. Other jurisdictions have done that, believing that open competition in a full and open market would lead to better value and perhaps a better service for the consumer. My understanding from the research I have done is that this theory has been proved wrong. The approach taken by the Government will lead to a much better outcome than those achieved elsewhere. Fine Gael has put forward proposals which seek to mirror the approach taken by the UK. Its experience of deregulation and tendering has generated very negative comments. I received material on a study undertaken by the Office of Fair Trading in the UK. The initial report outlined some worrying trends which undermine much of what Deputy Bannon said about deregulation or open tendering. It sounds good but the experience has not been to the benefit of the consumer. The material I received seems to indicate that deregulation resulted in reduced or, in some cases, no competition resulting in lower quality services. It was found that in areas with only one operator fares are typically 9% higher. This would be worrying from a consumer’s point of view. The term 'gaming' was used in the report, and this was identified as a practice where an operator could cut rural or less profitable ends from a commercial route with the expectation that ultimately the UK local authority would have to tender that element of the route to an operator who could then operate it as part of a subsidised route. This means that what was all under a commercial licence initially would end up receiving further financial support from the state at a greater cost to the state. I understand the initial report of the Office of Fair Trading refers to the Darlington case where a multinational company submitted a bid to buy a local municipal bus company, the Darlington Transport Company. It was unsuccessful in that effort and immediately flooded the market with free buses. The municipal bus company could not compete and went bust within a number of days. The local councils lost out because they had a facility and service with an inherent value of in excess of €1 million. Due to a deregulated environment, the financial resources available to a multinational company were able to put a company out of business. [47] This shows that deregulation does not work. The predatory practices of large multinationals will wipe out any competition in a short period of time and ultimately control the market to suit themselves and make a profit. It requires greater thinking. I am somewhat concerned about elements of the Bill but, by and large, its structure and framework are right and some areas might be tightened up through amendment. The Office of Fair Trading’s study dealt with tendering, which happens outside London. There was a near doubling in the cost to the taxpayer over the past ten years with a cost today of £1 per kilometre. In half of all local areas outside of London, 20% of tenders receive just one bid. This sets out the basis for the information gleaned by the Minister and the Department which shows the importance of retaining to some extent a regulated environment for liberalisation in a regulated way. While the two words might seem somewhat confusing, it is important that we take that approach. Bus Éireann provides a very good service throughout Ireland and there is a quality to that service. It provides value for money and its cost structures were recognised by Deloitte in its most recent report as being to a very high standard. That was based on independent research. To seem to undermine — as Deputy Bannon did perhaps inadvertently — what Bus Éireann does is wrong and unfair to the people who work in that service. They carry out their work in a very efficient way and that is down to the management of Bus Éireann, particularly people such as Tim Hayes, whom I believe to be an excellent public servant. At present, there is much criticism of public and civil servants orchestrated by some elements of the media. When one makes an effort through research to understand what is going on in many State and semi-State companies, one meets people of the calibre of Tim Hayes, John Lynch and others on the board of CIE who give it their all they have the common good of people at heart. These people are often undermined by the unnecessary commentary that goes on in this House in seeking to gain political advantage and outside the House by elements of the media. It is right that we recognise where public servants have put in place a service that has been to the benefit of all and, it is hoped, can be maintained, worked upon and built upon through the passage of this legislation. The integrated nature of the Bus Éireann network is a vital component of the service provided. It offers a vital link throughout rural and more urbanised areas. The current service is not, and was never intended to be, a rural service. A recent development, whereby the Government put aside funding through the rural transport initiative, is a way of dealing with that. I will address this later if I have an opportunity to do so. It is important that we focus on the integrated nature of the service as it is constructed because it is open to larger multinationals to cherry pick commercial routes. The multinationals will exploit some point-to-point routes and generate as much business on them as they can and seek to generate profits for themselves. The existing service facilitates some PSO or subvented work as a part of or at the tail end of some routes. We need to examine this aspect. As the Government rolls out the interurban routes, which will connect Cork, Limerick and Galway with Dublin, we must ensure that a service is maintained along what were the old routes. The new services will go point-to-point and carry the greatest number of passengers but it is important that those towns which are bypassed — some of them are quite large — still have an effective transport service. We must be careful in the issuing of licences by the transport authority at a later stage that, in an effort to offer a point-to-point service, we do not undermine the existing service. Deputy Bannon spoke much about Athlone and other places in his constituency. The simple reality is that if we were to deregulate the market, the bulk of people from Galway, Sligo and other locations would take the main routes and there would not be the business to allow a service provider to call to the villages and towns he discussed. What he [48]is asking for would be to the detriment of many of the towns in his constituency. We must be very careful about this and it needs to be taken into account in the issuing of licences. In an effort to address that, the State would have to provide more money for routes which would start to carry public service obligations after the removal of commercial services along interurban routes. I am aware that a large multinational company has begun to provide an unlicensed service on the Dublin-Galway route in an effort to put an indigenous provider out of business. The financial resources of this multinational allows it to offer €1 fares. Such companies will be able to push the indigenous operators off routes very easily. They have sought to undermine the existing regime because the 1932 Act fails to provide the sanctions required to deal with them. The framework set out in the Bill before us will, however, allow the State to act. I ask the Minister to ensure the issuance of a licence does not impact on the integrated network. The licensing of routes which have a commercial basis alongside PSO components by virtue of the way Bus Éireann has operated in the past should not be done in such a way as to require the State to pick up the cost of the PSO. I ask the Minister to consider strengthening the legislation to protect the network. Perhaps he could consider excluding those who have previously operated in an unlicensed or predatory manner from receiving future licences. I accept this would be difficult to achieve because companies can change names and directors but it is not beyond the Minister and his officials to come up with a method for excluding directors or operators. Some operators, including in particular the multinationals, recognise the landscape is changing and have sought to soften up the marketplace in advance. We need to get tough by ensuring they do not achieve their aims. As somebody from a rural area, I am cognisant of the difficulties experienced by those who live in isolated areas. In areas with aging populations, there are people who do not have access to private transport or relatives. It is vital, therefore, that the State manages a rural transport service. While the Bill before us does not deal with that issue, I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister that funding will continue to be made available for the rural transport initiative. However, we will have to await the budget for the details of that funding. Although rural transport was identified in the McCarthy report as an area in which cuts could be made, I am delighted that the Government in its wisdom has decided to protect that service. The Clare accessible transport project, which originated in the part of east Clare from which I come, has developed a great service for people in isolated rural areas. It has already been working on the pilot projects identified by the Minister which bring together the HSE, Bus Éireann and the rural transport initiative to develop a more comprehensive approach to the movement of people in rural areas. We owe the project our gratitude for targeting the most important groups, namely, the elderly, the young and the disabled. An inherent part of its work is ensuring that young and elderly people with disabilities can access bus services. Rural transport needs to move beyond initiatives and pilot projects and into the mainstream public transport network. The outcome of the pilot projects and other research can facilitate the State in introducing a comprehensive rural transport network which is integrated into national bus and rail routes so that people living in Mountshannon, Killanena, Feakle or Corofin have the same access to transport as those in Athlone or Dundalk. The frequency of service may not be the same but at least people would have access to the outside world. Rural transport services would also contribute to decreasing carbon emissions by reducing the necessity for cars. Rural transport becomes even more critical in the context of the Government’s plans to reduce the blood-alcohol limit as part of its road safety agenda. While there are differing views on these plans, the Government intends to progress them. A proper bus network will be necessary if people who live in rural Ireland are to have the same social opportunities as those who [49]live in larger towns and cities. To that end, I hope the rural transport initiative is put on a legislative footing. I ask that further consideration be given to the issues I have raised. Strengthening the conditions on which licences are issued can protect the PSO components of the network from practices which could otherwise lead to the deterioration of services or require greater investment by the State. I also ask that the legislation be strengthened in respect of operators. I suggest that we investigate whether licence applicants have criminal records, particularly in regard to drug or child offences. It is necessary that the financial stability and integrated network of the direct award contract of Bus Éireann’s PSO services should be considered when granting all categories of licences. Licences should not be issued if they cut across PSO services. Otherwise, the State will bear the costs of supporting the services in question or will be forced to close them and, possibly, reinstate them at further cost to the State at a later date. Those who have sought to undermine the current licensing regime should be dealt with appropriately and effectively. While this is not possible under current legislation, they could be dealt with when they seek a licence under the new regime. Their past practices should come back to haunt them because they have inflicted damage on the bus network.",Hayes
"I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Pat Carey, on his new appointment and welcome a counterpart across the room, Deputy Curran. I wish them both the best. I thank the Minister for his answer. I cannot pronounce the name of the drug either, so I will refer to it as BZP. I will briefly make a few observations on the Minister’s answer. I am delighted something will be done by March next year but it is somewhat far away as it will come in much earlier in the UK and other places. Some 24 of these shops are established throughout the country and there are grave concerns among parents on their activities particularly regarding the sale of mind-altering substances such as BZP. For many young people going out in the evening BZP has replaced ecstasy and other drugs that were previously used. The real concern is that yesterday’s newspaper reported research from the Health Research Board showing the prevalence of treated problem drug use among 15 to 64 year olds increased by 15% between 2001 and 2006. The sooner this drug is taken off the shelves the better for everybody and I ask the Minister to reconsider the timeline and do this earlier.",Carey

"The Hayes Report makes detailed constructive recommendations about the operation of specific services in the hospital and all of these will be implemented. I met with Dr. Hayes on 8 November to discuss the implications of his report with him. I met with the Chair of Tallaght Hospital on 9 November. I have also had discussions with the CEO of the HSE about the report. The main focus will be on what initiatives are needed both in the hospital and in the wider health system to provide sustained improvements in the services for patients. [333]An additional 2 locum consultant radiologists were appointed to the hospital in January 2010 to assist in dealing with the backlog of X-rays. The backlog has been cleared and currently there are 0. 54 locums in post at the hospital. On 7 September 2010 the HSE issued formal approval to Tallaght Hospital to appoint two new consultant radiologists. This is in line with the recommendations of the Hayes Report. Interviews are expected to take place shortly and the two successful candidates will take up duty be as soon as possible in 2011. The Hayes Report recommended that consultant radiologist staffing levels should be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate to the work load in each radiology department. The HSE is committed to carrying out a review of consultant radiologist staffing levels in hospitals and to strengthening workforce planning across all radiology departments. The review will be informed by the results of a survey of consultant radiologist staffing which is currently being undertaken by the Faculty of Radiology. The aim is to complete this study by the end of the year. Since 2005 there has been a 34% national increase in the numbers of consultant radiologists, from 183 to 245. Ireland now has a ratio of 1 consultant radiologist per 17,959 population, which is similar to the UK at 1 per 18,040 per population. The HSE is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Hayes report as soon as possible. I am confident that adopting this approach will help ensure the provision of a timely and quality radiology service in Tallaght Hospital.",Hayes
"I thank my colleagues on all sides of the House for their contributions to this debate. I sometimes wonder whether Private Members’ motions have any effect on Government policy and earning some dividend or change for people outside this House. If ever there was a motion that I hope will have some impact on the Government’s attitude towards an issue, this is such an issue. Every Member of the House will agree that one issue raised by all constituents is the cost of electricity and the increasing cost of simply living in Ireland. I want to offer some suggestions to the Ministers who are present — I am glad to see there are some present for the conclusion of this debate. I do not simply wish to give out about Government performance. Actions can be taken by means of legislation and regulation to improve the energy market in Ireland and reduce energy prices. I ask the Minister to consider legislating to allow the regulator to set a maximum price for energy rather than setting a set price, as is the case each year. The ESB could then be permitted to generate power at below the price ceiling if this is possible. It could benefit from increased market share as a result of more competitive pricing. I can understand why there has been a set price for the past ten years because we have been trying to introduce competition into the market and attract new entrants. Such new entrants could not survive under normal competitive conditions whereby the ESB would simply offer to generate at a lower price. However, the situation has changed in that regard. I would encourage the Government to fast-forward the transfer of ESB assets in the electricity grid to EirGrid, in an effort to send a strong signal to the marketplace that we support competition and a fair market place for all generators. We should reform the public consultation process around the decision-making when the regulator decides to increase prices or, if ever, to reduce prices. It is hugely stacked in favour of generators or the ESB who makes their case. In the United States or Canada the practice is to have a forum of discussion that includes organisations such as the Combat Poverty Agency and others who understand the worries and concerns of consumers and households. The regulator has a legal responsibility to protect consumers as well as offering fair prices to generators. The Minister needs to look at the regulatory regime for gas pricing as at some stage in the future gas will be coming ashore from the Corrib field. Under the existing regulatory structure for gas, this will result in increased gas prices in Ireland because we will be importing a much lower volume of gas which will therefore be more expensive and the price of gas to consumers will be increased. We have missed the boat this year with regard to the famous windfall profits being made by energy generators. The ESB has made what I would describe as a generous donation in a rebate of €300 million. We must be honest with people. Every household is already paying a carbon tax of 10% on top of their energy bills. That money must be taken back, put into a [397]ring-fenced energy fund and spent responsibly looking after poor people and low-income households who need support from the Government. There are some issues regarding smart metering but I will raise them separately with the Minister. In terms of energy rating, I welcome the substantial work being done on housing insulation. However, I encourage the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to examine energy rating issues regarding windows, through which large amounts of heat and energy are lost. Our rating system for windows is not satisfactory and we should examine the UK’s system which is a far more exact measurement of the overall window structure rather than just the glass pane. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has described fuel poverty as the most crucial social issue facing society, an issue of a crisis of affordability for homes across the country. Those are strong words from a senior Minister. Yet all this motion seeks in terms of a commitment — everything else relates to suggestions — is that the Government would introduce a comprehensive policy which puts fuel poverty at its heart rather than a description of other energy policies, as heard this evening, regarding conservation, climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, etc., where benefits for families struggling with energy costs are just a by-product of such policies. That is not good enough for an issue as important this one. We want a specific, targeted policy with a set timeframe and budget, financed by windfall energy taxes. Even the Commission for Energy Regulation at yesterday’s meeting of the Joint Committee on Communication, Energy and Natural Resources called for a carbon tax on energy generators. The commissioner acknowledged it is ridiculous that 50% of energy produced in Ireland is coming from private energy generators who get windfall profits on the back of consumers and households struggling to meet their payments. That is not just. If the Minister brings forward a real and measurable strategy to tackle fuel poverty, he will get constructive assistance and criticism from all Opposition parties. I commend the motion to the House. Amendment put. The Dáil divided: Tá, 75 Níl, 68. Tellers: Tá, Deputies Pat Carey and John Cregan Níl, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg. Amendment declared carried. Motion, as amended, agreed to.",Carey
"I was proud to listen to the contribution of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, when he introduced the budget. I applaud the Minister’s efforts and I am glad he listened to people such as me. Deputy Michael Kennedy suggested that I am on the socialist wing of Fianna Fáil. I was not afraid to speak up for my beliefs on social inclusion policies at our parliamentary party meeting. I am strongly of the opinion that we should cater for those who are more vulnerable, particularly at times when the economy is facing challenges. I do not wish to make too many political points but I am not going to take a lecture from those on the Opposition benches who do not remember — it does not suit them to do so — decisions taken in the past which led to people being deprived of money. During the period in question, benefit entitlements were so meagre that they made absolutely no impression. That is not to say I do not have ongoing concerns, of course I do. I see the challenges ahead and I am concerned about the future direction of pensions policy, which is an important matter. I would like the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen — he did a good job this week — to examine the position as regards back to school allowances, in respect of which further improvements could be made. [478]A number of individuals brought to my attention in recent days the fact that people who obtain good increases in their social welfare benefits are often ambushed by local authorities, which present with new rent assessments. Someone must grasp the nettle and take action in this regard. Highlights of the budget include the changes to stamp duty, provisions to reward work, income tax changes and improvements relating to child care. The latter will provide supports for hard-working families. I welcome these various improvements. The Minister referred to Tallaght and the Luas. His colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, mentioned the provision of almost €260 million in additional funding for public transport capital investment over the pre-budget outlook. He went on to point out that this funding will guarantee continued progress on expanding the Luas network. I strongly support this development. The extension of the existing tram fleet on the Tallaght line will be completed in mid-2008, bringing a 40% increase in passenger capacity per tram. As a Dubliner, I am pleased that construction will continue on the Cherrywood and Docklands extensions. I must, however, challenge the Minister regarding the proposed building programme as far as construction on the Luas extension through Tallaght is concerned. As stated on previous occasions, the Luas is an absolute boon to my community because it brings many people to Tallaght and allows them to enjoy the great facilities there. However, as the Minister indicated, there appears to be a problem. I call on him to ensure there will be no delay in respect of the Luas extension through the estates of west Tallaght to Saggart and Citywest. I hope many colleagues will support me in this regard. I could spend all day discussing with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Ahern, who is present in the Chamber, the need for a new Garda station in Tallaght. I hope the Minister of State will not object to my mentioning this matter, in respect of which I have been strongly campaigning. Other colleagues in the House are not afraid to refer to their local communities and the priorities relating thereto, and I take this opportunity to do so as well. Previous speakers criticised the Government’s drugs policy. There will always be challenges to be faced in that regard. However, I am a strong supporter of the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey. I was present in the Chamber last week when the Taoiseach took time out of his busy schedule to make a fine speech on the drugs policy. His doing so was a great compliment to the House and to the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey. It is important that Members should continue to inform the Government that drugs programmes should be properly funded. [479] The drugs problem represents a challenge to all our communities and we should continue to fight against it. I look forward to making a further and more comprehensive contribution in respect of the budget as part of the Second Stage debate on the Social Welfare Bill. I commend the resolution to the House and I will now concede the floor to my Independent colleague, Deputy Finian McGrath, who has some even more important announcements to make.",Carey
There could be many reasons for it. I call Deputy Ciarán Lynch.,Lynch
"I am not convinced that Transport 21 is a plan for the sustainable development of transport. The Green Party is concerned that placing 80% of the capital investment over the next several years in roads is not the right way to promote social cohesion, econ[1156]omic success or environmental sustainability. I hope the Minister for Transport will carefully consider his predecessor’s plans before accepting them as gospel. The present Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has made excellent comments about the need for sustainable policies. However, we need a change of course. When Transport 21 was launched I was surprised at its lack of detail compared with the Dublin transportation initiative final report of 14 years ago or many other fine transportation documents. The so-called 'slow modes' of transport, cycling and walking were not mentioned. As a land-use planner I noticed too that there was almost no reference to land-use planning which is crucial to transportation. I am enthusiastic about the references in the programme for Government to multi-criteria analysis on future projects and by the establishment of a national transport regulator and the discussion about joining up land use and transportation, particularly in the greater Dublin area. Greater Dublin is no longer confined to Kildare, Meath and Wicklow but includes Cavan, Laois, Offaly, Carlow and Kilkenny where there is a significant suburban sprawl. Unless the people in these new homes have access to high quality public transport we are creating a mess that will take several generations to sort out. I have grave concerns about rail transport. We are going backwards in respect of rail freight. While most European countries increase their rail networks to transport freight we are decreasing ours. There was almost a 50% reduction in the volume of freight carried by rail between 2005 and 2006, according to the International Union of Railways, going from 1. 8 million tonnes to 970,000 tonnes. That is a crisis for the rail network and we must do something to alter that. The new Minister will consider these issues carefully but we must do a U-turn on rail freight. This comes at a time when our carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector are up by 160% from 1990 levels and road transport accounts for 96% of these emissions, according to the EPA’s report in 2005. I am sure the Minister is well aware of developments with regard to the disconnection of lines at Foynes and the North Wall rail jetty in Dublin and the proposed closure at North Esk in Cork. I am concerned that if we keep stripping this country of its rail freight infrastructure we will soon be beyond the point of no return with no alternative to road haulage. This is not necessarily the fault of the Minister or his predecessors but the most damning issue is that Irish Rail did not make a submission to the Department of Transport’s Statement of Strategy 2008 — 2010. What was Irish Rail doing that precluded it from making a submission suggesting rail had a role to play in the future of transport in Ireland? Many people are aware that Ireland is the only country in Europe where railways are not used after 11. 30 p. m., despite the hundreds of millions of euro invested. Cork’s freight yard is [1157]slated for closure in January 2008 and Irish Rail’s regional managers seem to be turning away business as to court business would, apparently, incur disfavour higher in the company. What is going on at Irish Rail? Perhaps this approach can be traced to the negative sentiments expressed by Irish Rail’s CEO, John Lynch, under the previous Minister for Transport. It is time to chart a change in course and the first step is to make proper use of the €4 million invested in a high specification container fleet purchased in 2002. Grass is now growing under the wheels of those container wagons at the Limerick depot and something must happen in this regard. The use of demountable units means all key products can be carried in containers and container compatible units and I urge the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to examine in detail what can be done in this regard. I wish to spend a moment on the issue of integrated ticketing because with it in mind I pulled out my old Dublin transport initiative, DTI, final report from 1994. There seems to be a widespread belief that the issue of integrated ticketing has been around for five or ten years but on page 139 of the DTI’s final report from 1994 there is mention of integrated fare structure and ticketing. I would like to take the CEOs of Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, by the scruffs of their necks, kicking and screaming, to London. I would give each of them an Oyster card and a day to see how it works. I would then bring them back, give them six months to implement such a scheme in Dublin and if they did not achieve this I would fire them. It is quite simply outrageous that integrated ticketing has been an issue for 13 years without such a system being put in place. If the jobs of these CEOs depended on delivering an integrated ticketing system in Dublin they would have done so ten years ago. Their jobs do not depend on this so we must drag them, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century — or perhaps into the mid to late 20th century, since which time cities around the world have taken integrated ticketing as a sine qua non of a decent public transport system. Regarding Dublin’s bus service, I was glad to hear an Taoiseach express sympathy with the commuters left walking in the rain this morning. Even Deputy Joan Burton admitted to having a bad hair day due to the difficulties in finding a bus this morning. The bus drivers simply want to start their routes at the Harristown depot, rather than the middle of town, and this seems a reasonable request. I am sure the drivers also have unreasonable requests in this matter but I find it reasonable that one should start one’s route in the suburbs where commuters are and where many of the bus drivers live. Other elements are also required, however, such as a regulator for Dublin Bus and that is part of the solution. If I had my way I would sell off the bus depots in Ringsend, Summerhill and Donnybrook and [1158]use the capital earned to build decent new garages north, south and west of Dublin — where people live, where drivers live and where people want bus routes to start at 5 a. m., 6 a. m. and 7 a. m. It seems crazy that buses are parked on some of the most valuable land in Dublin much of the time when that land could be put to far better use. We probably do need some residual capacity close to the centre of Dublin but leaving dozens of acres of land covered in buses close to the middle of the city is a mistake. I would retain the facility at Broadstone because, as Deputy Tony Gregory mentioned, we need to reinstall the rail link that was there until the middle of the last century. We must provide more buses as Dublin Bus has been stuck in a rut with around 1,000 buses operable each year for the past decade. Some improvements have occurred in this regard and I would give the extra buses to the company. If Dublin Bus delivers the right routes that is well and good if it cannot deliver the right routes perhaps we should allow the private sector its fair share of the market. This is a matter for another day. There are some fine elements in the programme for Government and in Transport 21 but I want to put it on public record that we cannot meet our climate change targets while spending the vast bulk of capital funding for transport on new roads. A slight change of heart is required and we must run climate change policies across every Department, particularly the Department of Transport. I look forward to a change of heart in transport policies.",Lynch
"Yes, tomorrow evening. Recent revelations have added massively to the cost and uncertainty surrounding Fianna Fáil’s bailout of its pals, the bankers and developers. So badly has Fianna Fáil’s blanket guarantee turned out that the interest rate on Irish bonds, as we have seen today, is now well over 7%. If we stay at this rate, our national debt will double in ten years. We are on an upward escalator the size of Mount Everest. Although ordinary Irish people are taking tremendous hits in terms of cuts in services, extra taxation, pension levies and so on, the amount involved does not come near the actual increase in interest costs that Fianna Fáil and its disastrous mismanagement of the bank bailout and guarantee have brought down on the heads of the unfortunate citizens of this country. There are two major contributors to the cost of the bailout, as mentioned in the recent announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The bailout IOUs, or promissory notes, give rise to super-sized interest payments, adding at least €1. 7 billion to the deficit in 2011, which means that higher taxes and harsher cuts will be needed to meet deficit targets. Many people have been surprised by the rise in the deficit from €7. 5 billion to €15 billion. The answer is simple. Most of it — almost all of it — relates to higher interest costs, particularly with regard to promissory notes to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide. When he announced this last Easter, the Minister seemed to think there would be no interest charge at all, or else he did not tell us about it. Thus, either he was stupid — which I do not think he is — or he exercised his discretion and did not share his knowledge with the plain people of Ireland. In addition, the Government has agreed to buy all shares in the AIB rights issue at a price of 50 cent — as announced on black Thursday — even though the shares are trading on the open market at about 35 cent. This reminds me of the purchase of Farmleigh by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in his salad days. It was on offer on the open market at €15 million, but by the time he managed to acquire it the cost, believe it or not, had risen to well over €20 million. AIB shares cost 33 cent, yet the poor unfortunate taxpayer will pay 50 cent per share for them. Of the total €5. 4 billion rights issue, upwards of €1. 6 billion will be a [569]straight gift to existing AIB shareholders, including the many who took a punt on those shares — hedge funds and private equity funds — when they were floating at the bottom. Bankers have treated taxpayers as doormats. It is a case of all take and no give. It is time this balance was redressed and the banking sector made to contribute to the cost of cleaning up its own mess and preventing a similar mess in the future. There are two options I will recommend to the Government in this regard. The first is to provide that 100%, rather than 50%, of the cost of financial regulation be covered by the industry, which will result in savings of about €30 million per year, or €150 million over five years. At the moment, the banks, financial institutions and insurance companies pay half the cost of regulation, with the State paying the other half, which runs to about €30 million per year at present. Why should the industry not pay for all of this? Why should the banks and financial institutions not also pay the cost of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement? It is the least they could do, given the billions of euro we have poured into them. The second recommendation, which would require a little courage and engagement by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, is to campaign for an EU-level financial transaction tax on speculative transactions in derivatives and other types of financial product. Believe it or not, this would raise €1 billion to €2 billion per annum for the Irish Exchequer. However, it could only be done on an EU-wide basis, and therefore our Government should lobby for the introduction of such a tax in the EU. It would help to curb speculation and to document transactions, which is important. The Taoiseach shed some light on how Ireland is to pay down the IOUs incurred in bailing out Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society and EBS when he described the promissory notes — a cool €31 billion — as being akin to paying a mortgage. This is a €31 billion mortgage on Irish households for the sake of Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide and, in a small way, the EBS. To date, the Minister for Finance has issued €18. 88 billion in promissory notes to Anglo Irish Bank, with the issue of a further €6. 4 billion to take place before the end of the year. A promissory note for €2. 6 billion has been issued to Irish Nationwide Building Society, but the Minister has indicated that this will very soon increase by a further €2. 7 billion. A smaller promissory note, amounting to a mere €0. 25 billion, has been issued to EBS. These IOUs will total €31 billion by the end of 2010, but that is not the end of the story. The interest rate on the promissory notes will average around 5%, because the interest rate on the day the note is issued is applied. With repayments totalling €3 billion per annum, the total interest charge will add a further €10 billion to €14 billion to the final bill for bailing out the banks. The Minister for Finance must come clean on the interest rate, the term, the annual cost and the total overall cost of paying off these IOUs. We need to see the small print of the 'mortgage agreement' which the Minister has signed the country up to. The use of the word 'mortgage' by the Taoiseach in the Dáil confirms the Labour Party’s view that these IOUs will generate large annual interest payments in the budget every year for the next ten to 15 years. This makes the target of a 3% deficit by 2014 more challenging and will result in more tax hikes and spending cuts in the Government’s four-year plan. On 8 October, I tabled a parliamentary question on the proposed rights issue to recapitalise AIB. I was concerned that this €5. 4 billion transaction, which is to be underwritten by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, could involve an immediate and significant write-down on taxpayers’ investment. In his reply to me on 14 October, the Minister confirmed to me that he intends for the rights issue to go ahead at a price of 50 cent, even though the market price has ranged between 30 cent and 40 cent in recent weeks. In the topsy-turvy world of Alice in Wonderland, when, in a market-driven transaction such as this, would one pay 50 cent for a share that is currently trading at 33 cent, with an average of between 30 cent and 40 cent? It [570]is customary for shares to be offered at a discount instead, the State is taking them on at a premium, which will result in a further loss of €1. 6 billion in the State’s investment in the NPRF, because the share values will be diluted. The net beneficiaries of Fianna Fáil’s largesse will be existing AIB shareholders, particularly bottom-feeders who bought when the shares were very low — including hedge funds and private equity funds — whose investments will not now be diluted as much as they would have been. A further €1. 6 billion gift to punters on bank shares may not sound like a large amount to those in the Department of Finance in the context of an overall bailout cost of well over €50 billion, but to put this in context, €1. 6 billion is approximately one third of the total budget cuts and tax rises Fianna Fáil has in store in the December budget. The cause is the blanket guarantee that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and even Sinn Féin passed in these Houses in September 2008. Had we avoided the blanket guarantee, we could have probably avoided tens of billions of euro in losses that now lie on the backs of the taxpayers. We must make the bankers pay for the crisis. Even if it takes 100 years as far as I am concerned and as far as the Labour Party is concerned, we will get every cent these bankers have swallowed and that Fianna Fáil has given its cronies in the banks. When these people move away from being in government, we will produce a serious programme for reform and corporate governance that will end the cosy old boys’ club that exists between Fianna Fáil, the developers and the bankers.",Lenihan
I call Deputy Charles Flanagan.,Flanagan
"As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said yesterday, the budget has been constructed with six broad policy objectives, namely, to place the public finances on a stable and sustainable path, to restore our banking system to ensure that credit is available to both businesses and consumers, to regain our economic competitiveness, to protect employment, to stimulate economic confidence and to restore our international reputation. I must emphasise the importance of restoring our banking system. Some Members have criticised the Government for trying to tackle what is a very difficult situation not only in Ireland, but throughout the world. We have seen the attempts made in the USA and in Britain to deal with the crisis. If we could successfully tackle the banking system and restore it to what we were used to and provide the confidence that is very much missing, that would be the biggest and best protection we could provide to employment in this country. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have explained that on several occasions. Members understand the lack of credit that is available to businesses throughout the country. The banking system must be our priority, namely, to restore confidence in it, to get credit flowing again and to give businesses the opportunity to survive during this difficult time and to flourish later on. It has been necessary to take very hard decisions on both the expenditure and tax fronts, but in making these decisions fairness has been the cornerstone of our efforts. Notwithstanding the tough decisions taken, the Government has still made some provision for productive investment and this includes important provisions in the communications, energy and natural resources sectors. My ministerial colleague, Deputy Ryan, outlined to the House details of some vital investment projects in the areas of energy efficiency, renewal energy and broadband and this will play a major role in promoting sustainable development and competitiveness. Ireland is not alone in facing this severe economic crisis. Recent events show that we are in a situation of almost unprecedented international economic and financial volatility. As a small open economy, we are particularly vulnerable to the international situation. All the experts would indicate that global trade will reduce by at least 9% this year. As a small island nation that is very dependent on exports, that has to have a serious impact on our country. However, the firm and prompt action already taken by Government in response to the financial situation has now been complemented by equally decisive action taken in this sup[91]plementary budget. It has been necessary to take additional steps to achieve savings in the departmental budget and in the budgets of agencies under its aegis in 2002. The Department has further reduced gross current expenditure by more than €12 million since the October budget. In addition, a reduction of €15 million has been announced in capital expenditure. With regard to the allocations for this year, the area of current expenditure will demand substantial efficiencies and these efficiencies will be delivered to ensure that we live within budget. It should be noted that the overall allocation for the Department’s administrative costs is down, reflecting savings in respective consultancy, procurement and an 8% reduction in professional fees. The allocation for consultancy in the Department’s administration budget is down 27% per cent on last year’s spending. This reflects the cuts in consultancy expenditure. As Deputies are aware, as part of the agencies restructuring programme approved by the Government, the central and regional fisheries boards are to be replaced by a single national fisheries authority. This move is generally in line with the 2005 Farrell Grant Sparks report on the sector. It will over time promote the conditions for greater flexibility in the use of inland fishery resources while ensuring that the regional focus remains. I compliment the people who have served on the boards and the support we have received from all involved now that the new authority is being created. The rationalisation of the boards will strengthen this valuable sector, which fulfils an important role as a guardian of our inland fisheries environment. Implementation is currently under way to ensure a smooth transition to the new structure. The restructuring is being designed to consolidate and strengthen the service, improving its efficiency and effectiveness. I am happy to report that the 2009 budget makes provision for the continuation of the INFOMAR project, Ireland’s national seabed survey. This important strategic programme provides vital baseline mapping for a range of initiatives in the offshore, chief among these are the marine renewable energy developments supported by my Department, but the project also underlines offshore exploration, fisheries, aquaculture, aggregates and safety. This project is acknowledged as the best practice worldwide and it is carried out by the Geological Survey of Ireland jointly with the Marine Institute. The first three years of work on this project have been carried out very efficiently and within budget. It is the envy of several other countries. We are aware that a number of them are trying to replicate what we doing here. With regard to the communications sector, I am acutely aware of the importance of encouraging and facilitating more people to participate in the knowledge society and what we call e-inclusion has the potential to be positive in many ways. Information and communication technologies, ICTs, have transformed the lives of many people. They make it easier, quicker and sometimes cheaper to access services. They also make it easier to search for information, goods and even jobs. People who use the Internet can avail of on-line shopping. They have access to more purchase choices and thus can often avail of better value. The same holds true when it incomes to communication, with a range of excellent value on-line options available. However, it is clear that people right across the country are missing out on that opportunity. The full extent of the potential benefits technology can deliver for society will only be realised when its use is more widespread. This will be tackled on a number of fronts. The national broadband scheme will bring broadband to those parts of the country that would not be able to have it without some assistance. This will result in all parts of Ireland being connected. There is also a need for the rapid growth we are experiencing in broadband uptake to continue so that people may have the very real benefits that will follow. The e-inclusion fund has achieved some significant positive impacts. Last year, grant allocations were made to 87 organisations amounting to just under €2. 25 million. The reduced 2009 allocation [92]in the current fiscal climate facilitates continuation of this important programme with focused interventions to achieve maximum benefit from the resources available. We will have less funds to allocate, but I am confident that we should be able to make as much impact as possible. I started off by talking about Ryanair. It is very much acknowledged as a company that provided cheap air travel. Almost inadvertently, it has, too, played a major role in encouraging people to use technology. People came to realise that they could make savings by booking on-line. This encouraged more and more people to use the Internet. By using this technology, people were provided with great opportunities and this has led to increased confidence among the public. It is important to build on this and give people right across the country the opportunity to use information communication technology on a daily basis. In conclusion, I do not take any great satisfaction from supporting yesterday’s budget. It is very much with regret that we had to take the decisions we did, but we had no option as regards those difficult choices. I hope the sacrifices we are asking the Irish people to make will be very much of a temporary nature and that by all of us working together and playing our part, we can make this country great again.",Lenihan
Allow Deputy Byrne to address the House.,Byrne
"In addressing the issues arising from the Morris tribunal report and in referring to earlier reports, the Minister made the centrepiece of his presentation an attack on my colleague, Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP, who was formerly a Member of this House and was not here to answer for himself, and on Deputy Howlin, who is well able to speak for himself but who deserves also to be defended. It was Mr. Higgins and Deputy Howlin who, for a period of five years, sought to bring about a public inquiry into the events taking place in Donegal. It was they who brought information before this House and to the attention of successive Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the basis that these were matters of grave public concern into which inquiries should be made and which were ignored for far too long. I was the Fine Gael spokesperson on justice in the 12-month period leading in to the formation of the Morris tribunal. I became privy to all the information of which Mr. Higgins and Deputy Howlin were aware and formed my own view that there was a need for a public inquiry. On 23 May 2001, in a parliamentary question to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O’Donoghue, I asked whether he accepted, in the public interest, that a public inquiry should be conducted into the alleged events in Donegal. I emphasised on that occasion the importance of such an inquiry both in the interest of the many fine members of the Garda Síochána who wished to see the allegations addressed and in the public interest in order to restore confidence in the force. I said at the time that these matters should not have been left festering. On that occasion, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform kicked essentially to touch. I then made the point in this House that a banana republic would not deal with an issue as serious as this in such a manner. Fianna Fáil was in government for most of the period during which events took place in Donegal that gave rise to concerns that had to be considered by the Morris tribunal. It was Fianna Fáil who in government took five years to reach the conclusion that a public inquiry was necessary. On 20 November 2001, I tabled a motion in the House regarding the holding of the required public inquiry. I was supported in that motion through the contributions of former Deputy Jim Higgins, who had a different portfolio in the Fine Gael Party, and by Deputy Brendan Howlin. We made the case in respect of why an inquiry was required and why issues should not be left unattended to. The response we got from the then Minister was that he was going to appoint an eminent lawyer to examine all the relevant papers and the progress of various investigations into the allegations made. It took from 1998 to November 2001 for the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take these steps. [796]In March 2002, the Morris tribunal was established. Had these matters not been raised in this House and responsibly in discussions quietly held with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by former Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin, there would have been no Morris tribunal inquiry. Without the motion that I brought before this House, which was supported by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, no eminent lawyer would have been employed to consider the papers then in existence. It is true that if this had not happened the Morris tribunal would not have been established. Also, the initial draft terms of reference for the Morris tribunal, produced by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O’Donoghue, were the subject of discussions between the Minister, myself and Deputy Howlin and without those discussions the terms of reference, as ultimately adopted by this House, would have been deficient and issues that required investigation and on which important findings have been made would never have been addressed. This House and the State owes a debate of gratitude to former Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin for the work they did on this issue. A whole succession of Morris tribunal reports have resulted in revelations of improper Garda conduct that should never have occurred, of individuals being wrongly targeted and persecuted and of individuals’ lives being destroyed. The conduct of a small number of gardaí in Donegal affected the morale of the vast majority of the force who do their duty by this State and on occasion put their lives at risk in the interests of the public. If there is a criticism of a political nature to be made, that criticism is that the Morris tribunal inquiry, only initiated in March 2002, should in fact have been initiated three years earlier. It is farcical for, of all people, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to come into this House and launch a political attack on the people who primarily put pressure on the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government to hold such an inquiry. The Minister attempted, in a moment of artifice, to suggest that the €50 million incurred by way of public expense in respect of the Morris tribunal derived from one particular issue raised by former Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin, on which the Morris tribunal determined there was not a cause of complaint. However, complaints on all other issues were upheld. This is the Minister who was appointed to check out the corrupt activities of former Minister and Deputy Ray Burke of Fianna Fáil and who, by way of his own investigation, looked up every tree in north Dublin and reported to the then Taoiseach that there were no issues about which he should be concerned, a former Minister and Deputy attached to the Fianna Fáil Party who has been disgraced as a consequence of taking money in circumstances where no Minister should have been taking money or have succumbed to temptation. If there is a complaint to be made in this House about taxpayers' money being wasted in tribunals, it derives from the manner in which members of the Fianna Fáil Party going back to the late Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, the late former Deputy Liam Lawlor and former Minister and Deputy Ray Burke and others have tried to lead another tribunal a merry dance to avoid making appropriate disclosures and have regularly litigated in a manner that delayed that tribunal doing its work and completing reports. I would much prefer to deal in this debate with the specifics of the Morris tribunal reports. It was some of the earlier reports produced by Mr. Justice Morris that forced the Government to recognise the inadequacies of the Garda Complaints Board, a body long known to be incapable of fulfilling its statutory functions, as stated by Mr. Justice Morris. It was as a result of these reports that we now have a Garda Ombudsman and new statutory provisions dealing [797]with disciplinary issues in the interests of gardaí and the public with regard to the Garda Síochána. 4 o’clock The role of the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform today was to apologise to the public for the manner in which a small number of gardaí behaved in Donegal. Instead, he sought to deflect public attention from the shambles and incompetence of the Government by launching an unwarranted attack on a former Member of this House who could not answer for himself and on a current Member. The Minister should at least have had the humility to acknowledge that he, as part of a Fianna Fáil Government, delayed this inquiry and contributed personally to the damage done to the reputation of the Garda Síochána, to the public perception of that force and to the difficulties that continue to be experienced by individuals to whom this State has already had to pay compensation and to some of whom compensation payments remain to be made.",Ahern
"At the opening of his speech, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to households and businesses that continue to work off the excesses of the boom. He made the adjustments and cuts sound like a walk in the park just after the Christmas dinner or, alternatively, like joining the gym or going to Unislim. It is a way of working off the excess built up during the boom years. It is a pity that such slimming of income has been applied to working people and those on middle incomes because they are the people doing the heavy lifting in this budget. I daresay the Minister must be aware that people with children took the biggest cuts this year and last year. Let us remember child benefit is paid almost universally to women. I suppose that is a comment on how few women are Members of this House and what little political power women exercise compared to bankers. The Minister always says 'Yes' to bankers but in his different budgets he always finds it difficult to make payments in respect of children. The table of reductions in expenditure is spot on. Well done to the Minister, who has passed the first test in the memorandum of understanding. It is spot on for the IMF and the European Central Bank. The reductions of €2,192 million are very close to the figures in the memorandum so when they are sent over on Friday, as per the memorandum of understanding, I imagine the Minister will get one star for getting so close to the required figures. However, it is very noticeable that out of cuts of €2,192 million, the Department of Health and Children will take a cut of €746 million and the Department of Social Protection will take a cut of €873 million. Those two Departments, Health and Children and Social Protection, will take a hit of €1. 6 billion from total cuts of €2. 1 billion. That is a really heavy hit on a particular sector which, more than any other, encompasses the notion of social solidarity and need. We should remain a one-Ireland society. Yes, we had our billionaires but we should remain close to that notion. The principle of the Labour Party is that we are a one-Ireland society and those who have most should contribute most. Coming after 13 years of Fianna Fáil misrule, this budget might be described as the last sting of the dying wasp but it is a fairly vicious sting and one that carries a long tail life, not only for today but for the coming four years. The people who will feel the biggest sting will be those with children. I shall return to that issue presently. There is enough austerity in today’s announcement by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to make even the most ardent Tea Party fan grin in delight. There is pain for the poor, money for the rich, particularly for the bankers, and the rolling back of the State. In Ireland, we are now entering our third and a quarter year of fiscal austerity. It is very important that all the international cameras and press which have been covering this country should understand this fact. This is our sixth budget or adjustment statement since July 2008, shortly after Deputies Brian Cowen and Brian Lenihan were elected to their current offices. The first five budgets and adjustment statements took €14. 6 billion out of the economy but those in the austerity and hairshirt camp want more. The Irish are a little like Oliver —'Please sir, give me some more austerity'. Today, €6 billion of further austerity will bring the total taken out of the Irish economy over three and a quarter years to an eye-watering €21 billion, or 16% of GNP. I and my party met with the IMF on a number of occasions during the recent talks and it was very clear to us that those people clearly understood there is no modern example of a developed economy deflating to this extraordinary degree but claiming it can grow like Topsy. The €21 billion of deflationary reductions risks putting Ireland into the dreaded deflation spiral, the terror of the Hoover years of the Great Depression in the United States. That is why the Labour Party argued for an adjustment of €4. 5 billion, which, of course, would be extremely tough. There is no doubt about that. However, we wanted to promote and leave room for the certainty of growth. I met Mr. Rehn when he was here and discussed the magic figure of €6 billion which had appeared. I talked with him about what had happened in Finland and Sweden [42]during those countries’ banking crises. Mr. Rehn told me that the Swedes had learned a great deal from the Finnish banking crisis and what the Finns did, in nationalising and taking the banks into temporary public ownership, and so on. Then he said, 'And Ireland ... ' but he left any further comment unspoken. Ireland did not learn from Finland or Sweden. This budget smacks of Ireland having done case studies in Japan, with all the unfortunate effects of zombie banking on that economy. Unfortunately, we have mirrored that situation to an extraordinary extent. Japanese people who live in Ireland talk continually about the close parallel between what happened in their economy and what is happening now in Ireland. Japanese people I know tell me what the next thing will be. It is very unfortunate. Mr. Rehn, having delivered the €6 billion adjustment, I presume on behalf of the ECB, last week came back and reduced his forecast for the Irish growth rate to 0. 9%. What has all the austerity and deflation done for us as a country so far? In more than two a quarter years of austerity, unemployment has risen from 4% to 14%, which is 435,000 people. Austerity has slashed growth, it has killed consumer confidence and turned us into a nation who are busy paying down debt or saving — anything but spending. Those who study the behaviour of people in depressions, in particular shopkeepers and not just economists, can tell one that in a great depression such as we in Ireland are enduring, people change their spending patterns permanently. People who know people who lived through the great depression in the USA know that those people remain what the Americans call 'frugal' and 'tight' right to this day because they had the searing experience of what happened to them then. Many people fear that all this austerity is doing the same to Ireland. When walking down Grafton Street, one used to see people with two or three shopping bags. One would need to be a very dedicated, well off fashionista to come from Grafton Street with two or three shopping bags nowadays. One is lucky to see one shopping bag, often just a tiny one tied up in a bow. What else has austerity done? It has brought the return of the emigrant aeroplane. It is reckoned by the ESRI that by next April 100,000 people will have left this country, some of them our brightest and best young people who will have left during the austerity period of the first quarter of this budget. It is very sobering, particularly in regard to people who came home and began to build a life here and then left again. We know that GAA clubs throughout the country, not just in rural areas but even in Dublin, can no longer be sure of getting the guys and girls for teams at weekends because they have gone away to get work as, unfortunately, many of their grandfathers and grandmothers also did. It is very sad for people in Ireland to have to relive this experience. The European Commission and ECB are understandably outraged at what they see as Ireland’s fecklessness but should the punishment be visited disproportionately on the more vulnerable sections of Irish society? Ever since the fall of Lehman Brothers, the Government and orthodox economists have insisted that bank losses should be socialised whereas bank profits during the boom years were privatised. The debt burden which Ireland now carries, and which this budget is designed to ensure we repay, smacks more of reparations than of repayments. A more holistic approach adopted by our international 'helpers', with burden sharing of the bank restructuring, including by bondholders and foreign banks, and a longer timespan would leave us better placed to repay and to be part of a European wide reflation. In the end, this would be better for Germany as well. In one of Keynes’s best known works, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, he predicted that reparations to be paid by the German people after the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles would produce an economic and political catastrophe. To quote Keynes, 'If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp.' Europe and the European Union has an extraordinary range of achievements to its credit and membership of the Union has been exceptionally beneficial for Ireland and its people. The [43]European Union rests on a fundamental concept of solidarity. Without the glue of solidarity, Europe as a concept could be fatally undermined, not just in Ireland but in all those weaker countries, from Greece to Portugal and even to Spain, Belgium and Italy. A new Government should seek, as a priority, to renegotiate the terms. We need a cheaper interest rate, a longer timeframe and the kind of interest rates the IMF would normally apply to a country like Ireland, which could be as low as 3. 2% and as high as 4. 2%. That is the kind of interest rate the Government and its negotiators should have negotiated for our people. I know that many people are nervous of market reactions to large public deficits and sluggish growth. Let us imagine the market reactions to no growth and much larger deficits. What has driven the panic in the bond markets over both Ireland and Portugal is just that. There was the belief that both economies would be stagnant in the coming years and, therefore, would become even more indebted because we were so mired in the consequences of our banking failure. Growth matters desperately to Ireland’s prospects. Ireland, Spain and Portugal — all very different economies — are crudely lumped together in a bond market sin bin. We can escape from that sin bin if we can restore confidence in future growth from all sectors of the economy, not just the export sector. This means getting ordinary people buying and spending again, not just saving. Who are the winners and the losers in today’s budget? The winners are undoubtedly the banks, both Irish and foreign, which are hoovering up our money, not just to bail out Irish banks but to bail out the bondholders who so foolishly lent to our out-of-control bankers and developers. There is no doubt Ireland had exceptionally greedy and foolish bankers and developers, who borrowed like crazy when the flow of cheap money from the euro zone seemed literally like the gold at the end of the rainbow. There is no doubt Ireland and its failed system of governance and regulation carries the major share of the responsibility. However, some responsibility must be borne by those foreign banks which lent so recklessly and greedily. The ECB, from its lofty perch, should have been more familiar with bubbles. Another class of winners are those developers and property tycoons whose comfortable exile has been enabled and abetted by our kind and generous Government regime, which permits those who owe billions of euro in unpaid loans safe and easy transfer of very large amounts of assets to spouses and family — perhaps all those tycoons with their multi-million pads in nice places like Connecticut, within easy commuting distance of New York city, like Mr. Dunne and Mr. Drumm. We read all about them in the newspapers, this weekend and every weekend. To use the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan’s phrase, 'they continue to party on'— it is Unislim for the rest of us but party time for them. Who are the losers? A family with three children will lose €40 a month, which is in addition to the previous cuts in child benefit last year, where they lost a significant amount. Jobseeker’s benefit is being reduced by €8 and there is a cut to disability benefit. Most of those on disability benefit have limited capacity for work and their expenses are normally higher due to their disability but their benefit is being cut by €8 per week to €188. In addition, a payment to a person who is blind is down by €8 to €188 per week and carer’s benefit is also being cut by €8 to €204 per week. Payments for those with adult dependants have been decreased by €5 per week. Therefore, a couple in these categories will experience a reduction of over €13 per week. That is tough when one is on a fairly tight income. People in these categories are certainly losers. Other losers are the small and medium businesses, in respect of which the budget does not mention the flow of credit. We were promised credit would flow like milk and honey once NAMA got under way. Instead, NAMA seems to involve a reverse proposition sucking life out of the economy because its operations are so large. NAMA is probably the biggest property company in western Europe and it dominates a huge sector of commercial activity. The people [44]who provide professional services charge service fees of up to €240 million per year and NAMA is sucking the capacity out of banks to give credit to SMEs in the villages and towns of Ireland. I believed the Government, including the Minister, would have had something to say about the people who are under water or in difficulty with their mortgages, particularly after the Government Members’ experience of campaigning in Donegal. These mortgage holders are facing Christmas terrified that they may lose their homes. The Government, in addition to saying 'Yes' all the time to bankers, could make an effort to provide people with certainty that they will not lose their family homes, particularly when those family homes are also the homes of their children. A popular show that many teenagers like and produce is called 'High School Musical', one of the hits of which is called 'We’re all in this together'. Bearing in mind all the catch-phrases and soundbites that come from this dejected set of Ministers, nothing grates more than the sound of our two Brians repeating, 'We’re all in this together'. I have news for them: nothing in this budget offers a shred of evidence that they really believe this themselves. Every line of the budget suggests the exact opposite. At the end of this set of Fianna Fáil budgets and as a direct result of the Government’s policy, the gap between rich and poor will have widened. Ireland, after this budget, will be a more divided society than ever. It is the disadvantaged who will carry the bulk of the cost and those whose reckless antics caused the disaster will survive best of all. While their wealth will be diminished, they will have escaped, waiting for the chance to strike and come back again. The experience of past recessions shows the legacy of the past three years will be long-lasting. Unemployment at an early age can leave permanent scars. Many studies have shown that someone laid off during a recession suffers an earnings loss even when he returns to the labour market. He returns to less well-paid employment and earns less than those fortunate enough to remain in work. Even 15 to 20 years later, these losses continue to take their toll. There are wider social costs. The loss of a job has a marked impact on health and results in an average loss of life expectancy of one to one and a half years. Children suffer when their parents are laid off. They are more likely to fall behind in school and tend, on average, to earn less than the offspring of those who stay working. It is remarkable how standard orthodox policies have come a cropper in the past few years. Unemployment is a case in point. According to the Tea Party types, countries with flexible labour markets and low minimum wages find it easiest to adapt to the more challenging environment while those countries that insist on higher wages for workers reap the consequences of being soft. However, it has not turned out like this. Remarkably, Spain, which took the orthodox route, has a youth unemployment rate of 40%. Germany and Norway, which have protected workers rights, have kept their jobless rates at low levels. Therefore, I do not buy the argument that there should be a reduction in the minimum wage. We all know about the famous three Rs that are the bedrock of early education. There is another set of three Rs that became the bedrock of economic recovery in the post-Depression era and formed the basis of the post-war politics in Europe, irrespective of the country or party in power. These three Rs are reflation, redistribution and reform. If the Labour Party is in Government after the next election, reflation, redistribution and reform will be what its participation in government will be about. Governments have abandoned financial regulation with the calamitous consequences that are evident today. Where would we be now if there had not been some international reflation in 2009 after the shocks of 2008? The Taoiseach constantly points out, correctly, that our export sector does well. It has continued to do well because of international reflation. However, if the rest of the world had experienced the deflation that Ireland has experienced, our export sector, which unfortunately is not as employment rich as it once was, would not be doing nearly so well. [45]The Government must bring the budget into balance by a reasonable target date. The least plausible way of doing this is to starve the economy excessively of money in the short term. An adjustment of €6 billion is excessive at present. Next year is not the first year of a four year plan. As stated, we have already endured two and a quarter very difficult years, and adjustments amounting to €14. 6 billion in the past two years. Can the Taoiseach honestly state the adjustments have achieved their objectives? If he cannot claim this, how can he prescribe more of the same medicine? Why is the Government doing what it is doing? To some extent, it is because it is mixing with the wrong people. It has forgotten the advice of religious teachers in school on the dangers associated with keeping bad company. The Taoiseach and his party mixed with developers for years and wined and dined with them. They gave the developers every tax break and subsidy they demanded. They now associate with bankers, who are totally obsessed with the security of their position and, therefore, with budget harshness. Do Members recall that after the Taoiseach very kindly bailed out Anglo Irish Bank on the first occasion, Mr. Seán FitzPatrick stated on the radio, without a moment of self-reflection, self-awareness or shame, that he wanted cuts to the old-age pension, child benefit and all social welfare payments. He asked people to take their medicine and to give the money to him. This is what the Taoiseach achieved he gave the little people the medicine and gave Mr. FitzPatrick’s bank, Anglo Irish Bank, the money.",Lenihan
"I am getting involved in something now, about which perhaps I should not have said anything. Deputies Rabbitte, Brian Hayes and myself brought forward a joint matter on the Adjournment last night, which is proof that we work well together. We and the other colleagues in the constituency would want to support St. Joseph’s special school in Balrothery. I apologise for hijacking the debate in that regard. I am happy to make a brief contribution on this Private Members’ business, the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Powers of Inquiry) Bill 2010. Other colleagues, including Deputy Thomas Byrne, have covered issues the detail of which I do not want to cover. We have had an interesting day in the Dáil and I will not rehearse any of the earlier debate. I wonder how the SDLP delegation led by Ms Margaret Richie, MLA, whom the Chair welcomed, found that business. The business before us is important. While we are all entitled to express our point of view and make our views known on this Bill, we should compliment the Labour Party on raising this issue and bringing forward this Bill. The matter will proceed from there. Other speakers made the point that the main purpose of the Bill is to address the legal implications of the findings of the Supreme Court in the Abbeylara case for inquiries to be undertaken by the committees of the Oireachtas. Deputy Ardagh was the then Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women’s Rights and he did a fine job in that regard. The jury is still out on that episode and I am sure many people throughout the country and in this House would want to see those issues dealt with. We are advised that this Bill does not adequately address the complex legal issues which arose from the decisions of the Supreme Court on its ruling in the Abbeylara case regarding the powers of Oireachtas committees to conduct inquiries or to make findings of fact and conclusions as to personal culpability of an individual not a Member of the Oireachtas. The Bill, as drafted, might then be open to legal challenge, a point other colleagues have made. While the Bill may present a starting point for this process, which is important and I am happy to acknowledge that, further examination of work will clearly need to be done to fully address shortcomings in the Bill, particularly regarding sections 4 and 9. I suspect Deputy Rabbitte would be very much part of that debate. Section 4(3) allows for a committee of the Oireachtas not to be inhibited in the performance of its functions by the possibility of liability being inferred. It also allows for such provisions in section 8 regarding the performance of investigators. The advice from the Attorney General is that these provisions require further consideration relating to the issue of liability being inferred. [662]Other colleagues, including Deputy Thomas Byrne, referred to the banking inquiry. The Government has already decided that an independent statutory commission of investigation be established to identify, examine and report on the causes of the systematic failures in the Irish banking sector following completion of reports by the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and by other independent persons. The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland is due to address a meeting in Cavan next week of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am a member. That will be interesting. Perhaps that kind of appearance should also be duplicated here in Leinster House because I suspect many colleagues would like to discuss those issues with our leader. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to say a few words on this Bill. Deputy Rabbitte has done fine work on it, which is a starting point. I suspect he understood what the Government’s reaction to it might be, but I wish him well. I look forward to further debate on this subject.",Byrne
"I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Michael P. Kitt — the Milltown and Claregalway sewerage schemes, County Galway (2) Deputy Bernard J. Durkan — the operation of voluntary housing associations, whether they are operating in all cases in accordance with the articles of association as laid down in the relevant Act, if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will set out the requirements for the operation of such schemes in detail, whether the holding of annual general meeting, furnishing updated rent reviews, carrying out maintenance is a requirement, whether this has been followed by the Léim An Bhradáin Housing Association, Leixlip, Co. Kildare, and others given the funding provided by his Department in conjunction with the local authority under the capital allowance scheme which included the award of free sites, a 100% grant and if the Minister will make a statement on the matter (3) Deputy Pat Breen — the future of the newly refurbished dementia unit at St. Joseph’s Hospital, Ennis, County Clare, and the need to lift the moratorium on employment to allow for the filling of the positions so that this facility can open immediately (4) Deputy Jimmy Deenihan — the difficulty being experienced by parents of children suffering with autism in claiming domiciliary allowance since responsibility for this was handed over from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection (5) Deputy Deirdre Clune — the need to ensure that the vital upgrading of the N28 in Cork is prioritised (6) Deputy Tom Sheahan — the need for the Minister to confirm the future of the public service obligation, PSO, to Kerry Airport beyond 2011 from which Ryanair will receive €1. 75 million, a reduction from €3 million (7) Deputy Máire Hoctor — the need to restore recognition to Knock national school, Roscrea, County Tipperary (8) Deputy Mattie McGrath — the future of the Tipperary Hostel project and the situation regarding the supervisor and staff involved with this project (9) Deputy Kathleen Lynch — the need to discuss the difficulties for children with special needs in accessing primary care education in the Cork area (10) Deputies Seymour Crawford, Damien English, Shane McEntee, [742]Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin and Rory O’Hanlon — the need to review planning legislation and to compensate community groups following the recent withdrawal of Eirgid’s application in relation to the North-South interconnector (11) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to urgently outline the steps he is taking to avert the closure of B3 Cables in County Longford, in the light of the company going into receivership with a mere six days remaining to sell it and prevent the loss of 100 plus jobs, to the detriment of the socio-economic recovery of the region and the future industrial and commercial profile of Longford town and surrounding areas (12) Deputy Pádraic McCormack — the drastic cutback by the HSE west in the budget to the Brothers of Charity in Galway city and county which will have a severe impact on the service they provide to recipients in Galway city and county and (13) Deputy Tom Hayes — the detention of a person (details supplied) in prison in France.

"Consequently, the Government’s record is of a reduction in such activities. First, I wish to extend my sympathy to the victims caught up in this crime. I am sure I speak for all sides of the House when I express my hope that they will soon recover from this awful trauma. Members will also appreciate that it is incumbent upon me to remind the House that the robbery last Friday is the subject of an intensive and ongoing investigation. A number of individuals have appeared in court charged in connection with it and I suggest that all Members should be careful to avoid saying anything that could be prejudicial to the case. There are agreed response procedures between the Garda Síochána and the banks and financial institutions to deal with hostage situations in which members of staff or their families are taken hostage to facilitate robberies. These response procedures are detailed and all-encompassing. It is clear that some of the aforementioned security protocols were not followed in this incident. A number of questions arise regarding the apparent ease with which such a large amount of money was accessed. I accept that everyone is worried about how easily this money was taken from this bank. Shortly after the incident, I had a conversation with the chief executive of the bank involved. I also met the Garda Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner of operations in the immediate aftermath of the robbery. Following our consultations, it was agreed that senior gardaí should immediately meet the heads of security of a number of financial institutions to consider the implications of last Friday’s robbery. That meeting took place yesterday and the institutions have undertaken to carry out a fundamental review of their procedures and to report back, while working with the Garda in this respect. Further meetings are envisaged. It is no surprise that in the wake of ongoing improvements to the physical security of banks and to the cash in transit industry — Deputy Flanagan must admit the cash in transit issue has been taken care of reasonably successfully in recent years — these thugs have shifted their focus to the human vulnerability within the system. In general, the Garda Síochána will continue to combat such so-called tiger raids as part of the concerted efforts being made to tackle organised criminal gangs and the continuing measures being taken as part of Operation Anvil. In recent years we have introduced tough new measures, including seven-day detention periods, that [907]have been used in the recent past highly successfully by the Garda Síochána with the consent of the courts, for those suspected of various serious crimes, including kidnappings and mandatory sentences in respect of firearms offences. The Garda is continuing to make every effort to defeat the crime gangs responsible and I reiterate that I will not be found wanting in ensuring that it has the necessary support, both from a resources and legislative perspective, to so do. For example, I emphasise and have indicated in the House many times, the budget for Operation Anvil has been increased and ring-fenced from €20 million last year to €21 million this year. This is in spite of an overall reduction in my Department’s Estimate. In response to the claims made by the Deputy, while it would be completely counter-productive for me to comment on any detail of the surveillance activities of the Garda, I can confirm to him that the Garda Commissioner, at a follow-up meeting in this House today, assured me there is absolutely no basis for any suggestion that the resources devoted to the targeting and surveillance of such gangs have been reduced or withdrawn. Such claims are as baseless as they are irresponsible.",Flanagan
"I welcome the chance to speak about Bord Gáis and pay tribute to its management and staff on the handling of the Gaswest project. I have been listening to comments, including those of Deputy Tom Hayes, on the need for gas in various counties. We are lucky that the Gaswest project is providing gas to 12 towns in Mayo and Galway. The management of the project on the part of John Mullins and his team has been extremely professional. The impact of the project has been minimised through proactive working relationships with local authorities, both officials and elected members, and with various business organisations in the area. The project is an example to other State organisations of how to roll out complicated infrastructure. The Gaswest project depends on the passage of this Bill. It involves an investment of €40 million in 12 towns in Mayo and Galway, thus enhancing our economic potential and offering businesses and domestic users a choice in a very competitive fuel market. Given the increases in fuel prices in the past two years, piped natural gas is important to the region. The Gaswest project would not be possible without bringing the Corrib gas ashore. I welcome the initiative of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, in setting up the north-west Mayo forum. I appeal to everybody to use this forum to air their differences and concerns regarding the project, thereby allowing us to reach agreement and complete the project as soon as possible. The Gaswest project is being rolled out but there are outstanding applications with the regulator and Bord Gáis from various towns in the area. I speak on behalf of the east Mayo towns of Swinford, Foxford, Kiltimagh, Ballaghaderreen and Charlestown, all of which serve a key economic area in the country and are being outpaced by gas developments in adjoining towns. This area of Mayo is home to Ireland West Airport Knock, which has the potential to be an enormous driver of industry in the area in the coming years. A gas supply would be a key element in finally allowing the airport to fulfil its potential. There is an outstanding gas application from Belmullet, the capital town of Erris. It is the home to the Corrib gas field and also to all the controversy and trouble associated therewith. There is thriving industry in Belmullet but recognition should be accorded to the difficulties that have been faced in the area. I hope this matter can be addressed by the forum and the regulator in the coming weeks and months. The operations of Bord Gáis and its embracing of new alternative energies in recent years serve as an example to other companies. We are lucky that both Bord Gáis and the ESB, our two main power and energy companies, are embracing the need to change their methods of business to respond to the challenges of climate change, and to consumer demand as consumers become educated on climate change and alternative energy. The investment flagged in this Bill will allow Bord Gáis to further its work in this area and increase the options available to its consumers to provide energy-efficient and energy-friendly products. The board of Bord Gáis was appointed by the Minister. Credit is due to it on its foresight in respect of the advancement of the company in recent years. It has been transformed from a single-utility operation into an energy company that not only provides gas but also provides electricity. When considering this Bill, it is timely and appropriate for the House to acknowledge this transformation.",Hayes
That issue is definitely not in order. I call Deputy Ciarán Lynch.,Lynch
"Yes, I will produce terms of reference. Because this is such an important issue I would like an all-party approach to be taken, in the same way as I sought an all-party approach to the Green Paper on local government. Many of Deputy Ciarán Lynch’s colleagues sit on the consultative committee and do very good work. When drawing up the terms of reference I intend to consult broadly with members of the Opposition such as Deputy Ciarán Lynch so we can get the most important aspects included in the terms of reference.",Lynch
"This budgetary move by the Government is another in a long line of budget and other announcements by a Government, which, like its predecessors, has not done its homework on the implications of such a move. This fact is what makes the viability and workability of this scheme so questionable. The introduction of the early child care supplement in the first place was made without any idea of the cost implications. At least six separate times, the then Taoiseach, the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, who now is the Minister for Finance, as well as other Ministers all gave different responses as to the cost implications. At the time, the Government had no idea that it would be obliged to pay the supplement for all EU children with a parent who was resident here, regardless of where the child was resident. This was despite the fact that its purpose was supposed to meet the costs of child care where it was most expensive and unaffordable, namely, in Ireland. This was of course at a time when the Government thought money was no object and its approach was to find a problem and buy it off or to throw money at it. Instead of attempting to find the best solution or attempting at that point to begin to develop and nurture a successful and viable preschool system in Ireland when the money was available, the Government ignored the sector. It has decided instead to develop it during a recession. The Government simply gave parents a few more quid to use howsoever they wished and ignored the opportunity to develop a long-term system that would serve generations. That is the background to this issue. Fine Gael and other parties produced detailed proposals for the development of a preschool system that recognised the practical steps that had to be taken to develop it. I wish to make clear that Fine Gael fully supports the concept of one year’s free preschool for all children and regrets it took the Government so long to recognise its importance. While the Government finally appears to have seen the light, the details remain hidden, perhaps even to itself. Its amendment to this motion sheds no further light on the issue and does not even reflect what the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, himself has admitted, which is there will be areas in which places will not be available in January 2010. Fine Gael has tabled this motion because of the deep uncertainty among both providers and parents, who need time to plan their arrangements, particularly when they are operating on far tighter budgets. One should not forget the Government pulled the rug out completely from under Irish families. Young couples who struggled to pay massive mortgages in an era of pay cuts, job losses and pension levies at least had the early child care supplement to help meet child care costs and originally had the benefit of it until the child reached the age of six. However, the Government began to pull that back last year and then removed it completely for all children from the end of this year. No one has been fooled by the Government’s sudden conversion to the importance of preschool. It introduced this measure suddenly in an attempt to blunt the [462]impact and response to this massive cut to families. To use the Government’s favourite phrase, 'we are where we are'. However, the problem is that no one knows where we actually are with this commitment as there are a number of key difficulties, none of which are addressed by the Government’s amendment to the motion. The first and possibly the biggest problem is the issue of cost. According to the Irish Preschool Play Association, IPPA, following meetings with the Minister of State, it seems the capitation fee was set by surveying costs notionally and taking an average the Department believes to be viable. Coincidentally , this figure is practically the same as that offered by the vocational education committees, VECs, for these services. However, this conveniently ignores the fact that the VECs require the service from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m. and allow extra charges to cover this extended period and in effect, the child care provider is able to ensure it is adequately covered for the entire period. Most worrying is that in trying to sort out this issue, there appears to be a veiled threat on the part of the Department, which according to an IPPA statement is insisting 'the fund is hard won and generous', to the effect that if services do not make it work, the €170 million may be withdrawn as the sector would be perceived as being unready to implement the funds. In other words, it is a case of take it or leave it, regardless of viability, of whether one can afford to stay open and give a quality education to children. How can one expect a sector to be in a position to implement something so new and unexpected in eight months? It is the manner in which the Government has gone about this that has made it unimplementable, rather than the response of providers. Has the Minister of State thought about where his plan will stand, were the providers to decide not to take it but to leave it? While he is concerned about creating a two-tiered system, there may be instances in which providers simply cannot continue to exist because of the scheme’s impractical nature. How then will the commitment to a year’s free preschool for every child be met? Although the providers are practical and know that parents will opt for places offering the scheme, many of them believe they will not be able to remain in operation on these figures. The Government announced this measure without any consultation with the sector on its roll-out or its practical implementation. It has asked the services to be creative and to ensure the scheme works. While they want it to work and parents desperately want and need it to work, it will not and cannot work because providers cannot afford to participate in it. I have met some providers and have examined their figures. This is not a case of seeking more simply for the sake of it but is a genuine issue of viability. Costs are not the same across the country as almost everything varies and rents, rates and wages in particular. There is also an issue of affordability for parents. This is paramount and the Government should have taken that into consideration before it removed the early child care supplement and before it set the blanket fee of €64. 50 for 38 weeks. Many providers will be unable to provide the service for this fee and those that charge below this rate will move up to this figure. If providers cannot offer this service, children will lose out either way. The Government should have negotiated on this issue this prior to the Budget. Did it learn nothing from the over-70s medical card fiasco? The difference in this regard is that families and children will lose out. These services pay wages, PRSI, PAYE, accountancy fees, telephone, ESB and heating bills, water rates, mortgages on premises and loans for equipment. They also rightly must meet strict HSE requirements in terms of staffing numbers and space. The Government is said to be considering the issue of what will be the fee. When will Members know the outcome? When will parents and providers have certainty in this regard as the notion of a voluntary top-up will only make an uncertain situation worse? Members are familiar with the experience of voluntary top-ups in primary schools. [463]The Government has created this problem and now must solve it in a way that allows preschools to operate and allows parents to afford to send their children. It could consider, for example, a regional difference index based on local authority areas. This would take the basic capitation fee and index it to regional differences in the cost of living, wages, rent and rates and would account for much of the variance that is raising concerns at present. The newly-founded National Association of Private Childcare Providers has also made suggestions and I believe it is meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, on Thursday to discuss them. However, the Government cannot simply ignore the real difficulties many operators are raising. At an IPPA consultation meeting held to discuss this issue, only two out of 200 present voted in favour of the scheme as presently formulated and this was from a group that has campaigned so long for its introduction. There is a related issue of duration of service. While the recommended duration for Montessori training is three and a half hours a day, 38 weeks a year, the Government only is offering three hours per day. Parents can be charged for the additional 30 minutes but those who do not wish to pay this can still avail of the three hours. What is to stop a provider only accepting children whose parents are willing to have them stay for three and a half hours? Moreover even if a provider is willing to operate on the basis of both periods, Members can imagine the practical difficulty in a class full of three and a half year olds in which half get up after three hours, pack their bags, put on their coats and exit the classroom. Nothing will happen for those who remain for the final half hour anyway. Montessori training also ideally starts at age two and a half. However, under the rules, children of that age cannot be in the class of those coming under the scheme. For smaller child care or preschool providers, this will mean that where space is limited, such children now will only be minded in crèche-type or child care settings, rather than being educated through the preschool model. To judge by his statements and replies to parliamentary questions, the Minister of State seems to be convinced that availability will not be an issue and I genuinely question this conviction. The Government’s amendment to the motion also states that more than 65,000 additional child care places will have been created by the end of 2010. Ignoring the fact that this will be a year too late to honour the Minister’s commitment, this motion is not about child care but pertains to preschool, which is not the same thing. The Government is now admitting that some issues of under-supply may arise in the initial period, although that is not mentioned in its amendment, but that it will monitor the situation carefully. How big does it expect that gap to be and how does it intend to address it? How will it be addressed for the children affected? Will they simply get nothing, that is, neither early child care supplement nor a year’s free preschool? When the Government states that many providers are reporting vacancy rates of up to 25% in their facilities, does it refer to preschools or crèches? Moreover, exactly how many is many? How many areas has the Government examined to ascertain that such facilities have full occupancy and cannot afford to expand because it has removed all financial supports for set-up and expansion? Finally, there is a difficulty with the imposition of a minimum quota of eight eligible children. It will be a nightmare to administer for smaller services. If only six eligible children are enrolled, they will not be allowed to operate and where will such children then go? This issue must be addressed. Moreover, the tax implications of the scheme must be addressed. I assume that people will only be taxed on the profit at the end of the year, rather than on the fee that will be paid to them. In short, the principle is something that Fine Gael and I have long supported but the devil is in the detail, or in this case, the lack thereof. The Government has made this commitment and it is up to it and not the providers, to ensure it can be honoured in a workable way.",Andrews

"I thank all contributors to the debate on this Bill, in particular Deputies Ring, Wall, Michael D. Higgins and Deputy Ciarán Lynch on behalf of Deputy Wall. I extend my appreciation to my predecessors, Deputy Noel Ahern, who published this long awaited Bill and brought it into the House and to the Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey, who dealt with Committee Stage of the Bill. [111]Also, I thank the Ceann Comhairle, Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Acting Chairmen who have presided so efficiently over the passage of the Bill and, specifically, the Attorney General and his officials who have provided tremendous support at all times, as have the staff of the Bills Office in Leinster House. I believe we have had a constructive debate on all Stages and although there have been differing views on particular issues, we all had one objective, namely, to put in place an appropriate regulatory framework to enhance public confidence and to protect charities. I believe the issues raised during the debate have resulted in amendments that have improved the Bill. While we often divide on issues we have, through the overall package of measures introduced to regulate and provide public confidence in this sector without overburdening it, achieved the right balance. I hope the provision that those who are registered with Revenue will transfer across to the authority provides some comfort to those charities concerned from day one about issues of compliance. Also important is the commitment to review this legislation in five years. We may not have got everything right but we have moved a long way towards doing so. I hope this will be beneficial legislation that addresses many of the issues raised in this House.",Carey
"I think Mr. Prendeville is mellowing a little, as he has not fought with me for a while. However, I will send my regards to him. He has given us a very tough time on occasions, rightly so, as a broadcaster. Section 8 is a new provision which deals with the membership of the authority, about which my colleague Deputy Andrews spoke, as did Deputy Coveney. Five people will be nominated by the Government on the advice of the Minister who will nominate four people from names sent to him by the joint committee. This is a welcome move and a major shift from current Government policy, under which the Minister nominates and appoints all members of State boards and statutory bodies. I would like this issue to be teased out. I have not heard much more about it but the Minister of State, Deputy Power, mentioned it at our parliamentary party meeting last night. How will it work? Will there be a list of suitable candidates? Will people be asked publicly to send in CVs? Will there be advertising? Will expressions of interest be required? Is it envisaged that the committee will sift through the CVs in private session before it comes to public hearings and examination of witnesses? What background will be required? What will be the make-up of the authority? What is required to get the balance right? If we are asking people to attend a meeting of the committee, what examination will take place? Will we be grilling witnesses, similar to the American system under which names are sent either to the Senate or the House of Representatives for scrutiny and examination? If so, I foresee a major problem. I discussed this issue recently with Mr. John Bruton, the former leader of Fine Gael, in Washington DC when I was there to examine the committee system in my capacity as Chairman of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen. As Deputies know, [88]we are compiling a draft report for consideration by the House and the Government. I asked Mr. Bruton whether we should have a system whereby people nominated to any State board would be sent before a committee. He said we should be careful because such a system would put people off and they would not put their names forward. They will not want to serve if they are to be grilled about their suitability at an Oireachtas committee. Prior to that discussion, I was of the view that we should have the right to interview people. Mr. Bruton made some very important points, for which I thank him. I look forward to receiving a submission from him on the whole committee system because he had some very good ideas. I ask the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his officials to consider this issue closely and carefully. If a list of names is sent to an Oireachtas committee, some people might have political pedigrees, while others might not. A person may be ridiculed on the floor of the committee, even if he or she was the most qualified for the position, and not recommended by the committee. I would like to know more about this. Unfortunately, as I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I will not be able to hear the results. However, perhaps I will tune in to hear them. I commend the Minister who is probably the most suitable person for the job he holds. I had the pleasure of working with him for five years on the committee and he was an outstanding member, with outstanding vision and tremendous ideas. He was most helpful in every report we produced. Whether it was on fisheries, energy, broadcasting or mobile phones, he had a major input. I commend him on this Bill and his tweaking of it. I see his fingerprints all over it in certain areas, which is good. I have no doubt that during the lifetime of the Government he will do a tremendous job for it, the Oireachtas and the people. How much time do I have left?",Andrews

"The Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Deployment Programme, currently operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) provides information and support to those interested in pursuing the use of CHP, including financial support for feasibility studies. Capital support is available to those installing Biomass fired CHP plants, or CHP plants based on Anaerobic Digestion (or AD), or small scale fossil powered CHP plants. Anaerobic Digestion involves the processing of plant or animal by-products in digesters, allowing the material to breakdown and release methane, which can then be burned in a CHP plant. Since the capital support element of the CHP Programme opened, 80 applications have been received, with 58 approvals to date, amounting to a total commitment value of nearly €5m. Based on all approved projects the installed capacity of the Capital Investment projects will be 14,562 kW of electricity and 19,937 kW thermal — representing a potential saving of 25,254 tonnes of CO2 per year and annual displaced grid electricity of 77 GWh. The projects installed to date have a combined capacity of nearly 8MW electrical and almost 12MW of thermal energy, and have drawn down over €1. 6m in funding. To date, 4 grant applications have been made for Biomass CHP, of which 3 were received in the last few months. One application has also been received for an AD CHP plant. Of the 4 Biomass applications, 1 has been approved in County Cork (to a value of 1. 3 million). This project is currently under construction. My Department and SEI is also in regular contact with the IBEC CHP Group and directly with individuals in the CHP industry. Decisions in relation to funding for CHP Programmes in 2010 will be subject to the Estimates process.",Power
"With no disrespect to the two Ministers of State opposite, I regret the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is not in the Chamber to take this important matter. She did not even attend the Chamber earlier when the matter was raised on the Order of Business. My only concern is for the best outcome for the country’s children. The resignation of Philip Lynch as chairman of the national paediatric hospital development board has cast a cloud over the hospital’s future, however. Several substantial issues raised by Mr. Lynch have not been adequately answered by the Government. Has the €400 million funding for the project been ring-fenced? A gap in funding, already believed to be €200 million, will have to be made up in philanthropic donations. From inquiries I have learned no one believes such a gap can be filled by this means. The site for the proposed hospital has been controversial since it was first announced. There have been constant questions about the level of consultation and transparency in this choice. It is also believed political pressure was brought to bear on the choice. It is now being asked whether a national children’s hospital can be delivered. Clear answers need to be provided to these questions. Mr. Lynch also raised questions as to whether funding has been secured for an ambulatory centre at Tallaght which was to be part of the national paediatric hospital. [88]The public has lost trust in believing the Government has the capacity or even intends to develop a national paediatric hospital. Questions have also been raised as to whether the preferred site is appropriate since access, in particular, seems to be a problem. I do not just raise the question of whether it should be built on a greenfield site. Other suggestions, such as locating it at St. James’s Hospital, were put forward at the time. The questions I ask must be answered in the immediate future. Somebody must examine these issues independently, preferably somebody with expertise from outside this country. He or she should provide the public with honest answers to all these questions. The biggest question now is whether the funding will be available at all, irrespective of the site on which the hospital is to be built. Is the funding secured or can it be secured? These questions should have been answered tonight by the Minister for Health and Children, who is responsible. She went on the airwaves over the weekend and blustered on this. She basically said: 'I am the Minister, I am telling you it is going to happen and that will have to be good enough.' A Green Party Minister and Fianna Fáil Minister are present. It should not be good enough for either of their parties to simply have the Minister for Health and Children say that. This man was put in the position of chairing this group. He is a person in whom I presume the Government had faith at the time. He has now resigned and raised these substantial questions which were not answered in a transparent or effective way by the Minister for Health and Children over the weekend. I look forward to the Minister of State’s reply, but this is not an adequate way of dealing with the issue. The Minister for Health and Children has not been in the House to answer questions and there was no response from the Government today to provide for a proper question and answer session with the Minister to address this crucial issue for our children.",Lynch
"I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Lucinda Creighton — the urgent need for an investigation by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government into the practices in the Dublin City Council planning department which arrived at such an inconsistent decision on planning application 5051/07 (former Jury’s and Berkeley Court site, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4), in light of last Friday’s decision by An Bord Pleanála (PL29S. 228512) (2) Deputy Alan Shatter — the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to make public the Hynes report, received in her Department on 30 October 2008, which investigated why the McCoy report into allegations of abuse at Brothers of Charity services in Galway took eight years to complete, from 1999 to 2007 (3) Deputies Tom Sheahan and Seán Sherlock — the proposed closure of St. Columbanus’s Hospital, Killarney and of Heatherside Hospital, Cork (4) Deputy Joe McHugh — the future of the Lough Foyle and the Lough Swilly ferry services (5) Deputy Frank Feighan — to ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if her Department will make necessary changes in the qualifying criteria for CE schemes given that there are many vacancies on CE schemes, in particular in County Roscommon, while FÁS does not have eligible candidates to fill these vacancies, despite the high rate of unemployment in the county, owing to extremely strict eligibility requirements, including being unemployed and receiving social wel[472]fare payment for 12 months to ask the Tánaiste if she will amend the regulation whereby a person, unemployed for 11 months and offered temporary employment for, for example, two to four weeks is automatically ruled out of qualifying for a CE scheme and is forced to commence again the 12 months unemployment status to ask the Tánaiste if she is aware there are people due to come off CE schemes in County Roscommon shortly and there are no candidates available to replace them due to the strict guidelines and to ask the Tánaiste if, in the current climate, she will reduce the unemployment criteria and the 12-month in receipt of social welfare payment clause and ensure if persons get temporary employment during that time they are not automatically disqualified (6) Deputy Timmy Dooley — the psychological assessment of children with suspected autism in County Clare (7) Deputy Ciarán Lynch — to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government if he will lay before the House the details, including financial implications, of his plans to enable local authorities to lease estates from developers as outlined by the Minister of State in recent days and if he will lay out his programme to spend €20 million in leasing currently idle properties from developers (8) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that after a wait of 12 years a full complement of appropriate services for secondary care facilities is provided under phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital, Mullingar, County Westmeath, to ensure patient safety and best possible outcomes (9) Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to instruct the HSE to respond positively to the call by general practitioners in Counties Cavan and Monaghan for a full independent risk assessment of the safety implications for patients affected by the planned closure of 56 acute medical beds in Monaghan General Hospital and of the GPs’ capacity to provide a safe service in such circumstances, concerns which have led GPs in Cavan-Monaghan to withdraw from HSE planning groups (10) Deputy Jimmy Deenihan — the arrangements that will be put in place to ensure the continued efficient transport of blood samples on a daily basis for a patient (details supplied) in County Kerry (11) Deputy Joe Costello — the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure the FÁS training, employment and community facilities in Jervis Street, Dublin 1 are not closed down (12) Deputy Noel J. Coonan — that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provide funding for a new fire station facility in Cloughjordan, County Tipperary — an application was first made by North Tipperary County Council in May 2005 — taking into account the extreme and deteriorating conditions at the establishment and consequent health and safety concerns (13) Deputy Seymour Crawford — the urgent need to have the four hours home help at least returned to an 83 year old County Monaghan person (details supplied), who had her seven hours home help first reduced to four hours per week and has now been further reduced to two hours per week since the 28 January 2009. This lady has no family or relations to support her and depends on her home help and kind neighbours (14) Deputy Kieran O’Donnell — that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government release the committed funding for the Limerick regeneration project to enable housing, infrastructural and other programmes to commence immediately in order to restore public trust in the project and (15) Deputy Ulick Burke — to ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to indicate her plans for FÁS apprentices who have been made redundant by their sponsors and who cannot find an alternative placement in the current climate. The matters raised by Deputies Tom Sheahan, Seán Sherlock, Timmy Dooley, Jimmy Deenihan and Joe McHugh have been selected for discussion.",Lynch
"I wish to share time with Deputies Jim O’Keeffe, Paul Connaughton, Tom Sheahan, Catherine Byrne, Kieran O’Donnell and Simon Coveney. The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, spoke eloquently in the debates leading up to the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2007. On 19 December 2006, he stated that 'a Government can have no greater priority than the safety of its people' and pointed out that the Government had provided a 'comprehensive programme of measures to ensure that the full resources of the State are brought to bear as never before'. He also asserted that it is 'no use willing the end of gangland activities unless we will the means'. The Criminal Justice Act 2007 introduced a wide range of means to deal with the scourge of gangland crime, yet two years later we still await fundamental operational measures on the ground. Hurdles are continually being placed before the Garda Síochána in it efforts to apprehend gang members and establish cases against them. Problems have been encountered with the establishment of a DNA database, the upgrading of Garda communications equipment and the updating of interview principles and procedures. Without reform and change in these areas, bail laws, sentencing recommendations and judicial instruments will be of little use. I express my sympathy to the family of the late Shane Geoghegan. The brutal murder of Mr. Geoghegan in Limerick during the weekend before last horrified the nation and clearly illus[107]trated the threat posed by gangland figures to innocent members of society. The failure of the criminal justice system to secure convictions in 113 of the 127 gangland killings which have taken place since 1998 shows the Government is losing the war on gangland crime. The Minister’s response to this issue last week and in speaking to the motion last evening struck me as one of resignation, an acceptance of the status quo and an acknowledgement, as it were, that society will have to put up with this problem. The Minister’s attitude is not good enough. Has anybody been convicted of directing gang activity under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2007? The answer is 'No' and this will continue to be the case for as long as the Minister fails to take control and lead a strong, unstoppable effort to break up the gangs and put the thugs behind bars. I commend members of the Garda Síochána, especially those based in Limerick, on their work in solving the cases presented to them. Better police work solves crime in the short term. Unfortunately, however, the Garda must be lucky all the time, whereas gangs can afford to be lucky occasionally. The Government must ensure the Garda is equipped with the most modern equipment to counter gangland crime. The force needs the long promised digital radio communications system as the current equipment is outdated and easy to hack into. Speaking on the Garda communications system in December 2006, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. McDowell, referred to high level project groups, procurement processes, financial due diligence and finance approval, in other words, the usual web of red tape and paper shuffling. Nothing has changed under the current Minister’s watch. Those on the ground who put their lives on the line are still waiting. When will the essential communications system be made available to the Garda? On the criminal age of responsibility, anecdotal evidence suggests children are being exploited and drawn into gangland activity. In recent times, we have heard of ten year olds proudly wearing bullet proof vests. I urge the Minister to treat those responsible for drawing children into gangland crime with the full vigour of the law. With regard to Garda interrogation, the procedure under which members of the Garda Síochána are compelled to document and record evidence needs to be revised. The practice of gardaí having to transcribe questions during interrogation is outdated. Surely it is time video recordings of interrogation sessions were allowed as evidence. Gangland crime is closely linked to the drug trade. Gangs rule with virtual impunity and jealously guard and fight for territory. Their members have no regard for life and will do anything to protect their empires. The value of drug seizures in the past year is approaching €1 billion. The link between gang suppliers and so-called middle Ireland must be tackled. To break this link, much stronger penalties should be imposed on recreational drug users, for example, by making them participate in community service in areas which have been savaged by drugs. Furthermore, moneys seized from gangland activities should be pumped back into these communities.",O'Keeffe
Deputy Tom Hayes will have to find an alternative way to raise that matter.,Hayes
"On the statistics, it is important to state how many people are here a total of 26,000 international students studied in Irish higher education institutions, HEIs, in [659]the academic year from 2009 to 2010. This is broadly similar to previous years. Approximately 94,000 international students studied in English language schools recognised by the Department of Education and Skills. It is a decrease from the 120,000 students in 2008 but there are issues, including the global downturn and currency fluctuations, which have caused the decline. That being said, as Deputy Hayes knows, the Asia strategy is being reviewed and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation will introduce a new strategy on trade which will set down further targets. There have been issues in setting a quality mark, which is something I continue to believe is hugely important.",Hayes
"I thank Deputies for their contributions this afternoon and welcome the expressions of support and goodwill across the Chamber for this agreement. Such unity of purpose in this House has been a great strength of the peace process and will remain important as we encourage the parties in Northern Ireland to build on the progress reached at Hillsborough. The spirit of partnership which has marked the relationship between the two Governments as guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement was once again demonstrated at Hillsborough. I pay tribute to the role the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister played in convening the talks and creating the conditions that enabled the parties to break the deadlock. The Taoiseach and Prime Minister worked very closely throughout this period and stayed in close touch with the talks throughout, applying appropriate and judicious degrees of encouragement, advice and pressure as we moved to final agreement. In particular, I want to pay tribute to my counterpart, Secretary of State Shaun Woodward. He and I have worked together to secure the devolution of policing and justice not just for the past two weeks, but for the past 18 months. His commitment has been extraordinary and I thank him for it. However, it was the Northern political parties that were at the centre of what happened at Hillsborough over the past fortnight. This is their agreement just as it is their Executive and their Assembly. This deal was essential to enable the Executive and Assembly to move forward. Its implementation is the primary responsibility of all of the parties in Northern Ireland. Reaching agreement on a timetable for the devolution of justice and policing powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly was the centrepiece of this agreement. This was a major item of unfinished business from the St. Andrews Agreement. The transfer of these powers on 12 April will represent the consolidation of devolution at Stormont and the completion of the transformation of policing begun with the publication of the Patten report in 1999. The appointment of a Minister for Justice, accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly, will signal a strong vote of confidence in the robustness and sustainability of the devolved institutions. The DUP and Sinn Féin occupy a joint office which is at the heart of devolved government in the North and, thus, their capacity to engage with each other and reach accommodation is crucial to the stability of the institutions. The fact that they, facilitated by the Governments, have been able to conclude this comprehensive agreement around a number of contentious [575]and sensitive issues is, therefore, a major step forward. I want to also put on record appreciation for the leadership and political will displayed by the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson MLA, and the deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness MLA, that made this agreement possible. Government is about more than concluding agreements — the real business of government is implementation. In that process of implementation, the role of the other parties in the Assembly and the Executive is a key element, as several Deputies have articulated. This was already acknowledged by both Sinn Féin and the DUP in last Friday’s plenary meeting. Questions such as the better functioning of the Executive and progress on the outstanding issues from the St. Andrews Agreement can only be taken forward successfully on an inclusive basis, taking advantage of all of the talent, expertise and goodwill available in the Assembly. In that context, I again offer my appreciation of the leadership role Mark Durkan MLA has played over the years. He has made a most notable contribution to the peace process and we look forward to his continued advice as he devotes his career to the Westminster Parliament. We offer his successor, Margaret Ritchie, every best wish as leader of the SDLP. I have been in contact with her and will be meeting her shortly to facilitate ongoing consultation and engagement between the Government and the SDLP. There are a number of areas which will be covered in the working group to be established on outstanding commitments from the St. Andrews Agreement. One of particular interest to this House is that of the Irish language. The Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement recognised the importance of respect, tolerance and understanding of the linguistic diversity and culture of Northern Ireland. The Irish Government is committed to assisting the development of the Irish language in Northern Ireland and the implementation of outstanding commitments made in the St. Andrews Agreement, including an Irish language Act. We also look forward to early agreement on an Irish language strategy. Since language issues are a devolved matter, this is an area where the Government works directly with the Northern Ireland Executive, including through the North-South body, Foras na Gaeilge. Engagement continues with the British Government on relevant non-devolved areas such as broadcasting and through the British-Irish Council. I am pleased that, only last week, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his British counterpart signed a memorandum of understanding which will facilitate the continued availability of Irish television services, including TG4, in Northern Ireland after digital switchover. As the House will be aware, the promotion and protection of the Irish language is a key priority for the Government in this jurisdiction and the work in this area can have a positive effect on the island as a whole. The 20-year strategy for the Irish language will have a beneficial impact on speakers of the Irish language on the whole island, and the Government will look at how these synergies can be optimised. I also want to reiterate the need for tolerance and respect for both the Irish language and Ulster Scots language and culture in Northern Ireland. I have previously urged a more open approach to the Irish language by those who erroneously see it as something threatening. Far from being feared, the languages and cultures of this island ought to be shared and celebrated. I look forward to a more mature and less politicised discussion about the Irish language, building on the improved dynamic and mutual respect that enabled agreement to be reached in Hillsborough last week. In moving forward, we need to build and consolidate trust between communities in a spirit of equality and tolerance for each other’s political aspirations, cultural expression and inheritance. Much has already been achieved in building sustainable relationships where once there [576]was mistrust. However, more needs to be done to knock down the barriers which physically and metaphorically separate too many in the North. One of the issues which goes to the heart of the remaining divisions is that of parading. While most parades pass off peacefully, there remain a handful of contentious parades and another small few which retain the potential for difficulty. Against this background, the agreement between the parties at Hillsborough sets out a process for an improved framework for the management and regulation of parades. Their aim is to bring forward agreed outcomes which can achieve cross-community support. This, in itself, will be a significant step forward. The core point is that any enhanced framework would have at its core the principles of local people providing local solutions and respect for the rights of those who parade and those who live in the areas through which parades pass. This includes the right for everyone to be free from sectarian harassment. Until new arrangements have been agreed and put in place, the Parades Commission will continue to do its valuable work. An ambitious timeframe has been set for this work. The First Minister and deputyFirst Minister have now appointed representatives to the working group provided for in theHillsborough Agreement. It will report back with agreed outcomes within weeks. These outcomes will, in turn, provide the basis for widespread public consultation, leading to responsibility for parading being devolved to the Northern institutions and Assembly legislation before the end of the year. The agreement between the parties to move forward on an agreed basis has the potential to transform the situation, lifting the stresses and pressure on communities arising from parades. Realising this potential will require generosity of spirit and respect for others on the part of all stakeholders. There is also a duty of care on those who take this work forward to ensure that the rights of all are equitably accommodated. The Government will remain close to this process as it progresses through the various stages. As colleagues have recognised, the Hillsborough agreement provides a new platform upon which we can build stronger and deeper North-South co-operation over the months and years to come. There have been more than 50 meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council since the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly in May 2007. Every one of those meetings has included Ministers from the Unionist and Nationalist traditions in Northern Ireland, as well as their Irish Government counterparts. This is a hugely significant level of engagement between elected representatives in both parts of the island on the economic and social issues of most concern to those we represent. The era of 'back-to-back' development has truly been consigned to the past. Ministers, North and South, no longer hesitate to pick up the phone or meet in person, discuss common challenges, argue options and agree shared approaches to the difficulties we face. That is politics as it should be. The political compromises reached at Hillsborough will free up time and space to tackle the bread-and-butter issues of most concern to ordinary people. The Government is determined to work closely with our Northern Ireland Executive colleagues to tackle those issues on an all-island basis, wherever possible and helpful. We will continue to take a North-South approach to meeting the infrastructural needs of the island, as evidenced by our support for the upgrading to dual carriageway status of the new A5 road to Derry and Letterkenny. We are also stepping up our efforts to build a smart and dynamic 'innovation island' by increasing our collaboration through the US-Ireland Research and Development Partnership and under the EU’s seventh framework programme. We are intensifying our co-operation in areas like health and education, with North-South studies completed or in train on how we can achieve economies of scale and deliver improved services. We are looking forward to examining closely with our Northern Ireland Executive colleagues ways in [577]which both our administrations can save money by eliminating duplication on the island. It is simple common sense that we can do more together, for less, if we pool our talents, resources and time in the many areas in which we have shared ambitions and targets. We look forward to completing the review of North-South bodies, as set out under the St. Andrews Agreement, and areas of co-operation as soon as possible, thus ensuring Ministers can address issues of most pressing concern through the North-South Ministerial Council. We are also determined to bring into being the North-South consultative forum and the North-South parliamentary forum, which will each have a valuable role in advising the Government and Northern Ireland Executive on socioeconomic and cultural issues with a North-South dimension. The time is now right to make progress on all these outstanding issues and we look forward to doing that over the months ahead. I thank all Members for their contributions. We will take on board many of the constructive suggestions that have been made, not least the comments made by Deputy Ruairí Quinn in terms of exploring the possibility of a shared history of these islands being developed in curricular terms for children in both Ireland and Great Britain. That idea has merit and, while some historians would relish such a task, it would be a significant one. I will not hazard a guess on whether consensus could be achieved on that as quickly as we have achieved consensus in terms of the political framework we have just developed and elaborated upon.",Andrews
"I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, for introducing the motion. I also congratulate my county colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, on her new position as Minister for Education and Skills. As she is aware, we have 403 special needs assistants in County Donegal. My colleague, Deputy Stanton, articulated a point about the EPSEN Act which I will not repeat but the Act is the cornerstone of any future system of integrated education in terms of special needs support. That is where the focus has to be. The Tánaiste should take that point on board. Any of the practitioners to whom I have spoken, be they special needs assistants, principals or teachers have indicated that the EPSEN Act is critical to getting a proper structure in place to facilitate special education. 6 o’clock Positives will emerge from the review but negatives will also be evident. The role of special needs assistants has to be reviewed. We should use them as a resource, not as the Government is currently doing in terms of budgetary cuts because there is insufficient money to retain the present complement of special needs assistants. We should also learn from their experiential learning and the valuable work in which they have been involved. Every time I meet SNAs in my clinic, I find they have a new angle, see new opportunities and see where the weaknesses are. The SNAs are critical to any review to be carried out. Parents of people with disabilities or special educational needs are no different from those with a child that does not need support. They have the same aspirations, ambitions, hopes and dreams regarding their children getting an education. We need to specify that special needs supports are not just about care because we need to differentiate between care and education. Dr. Robin Eames said at a sermon in Armagh approximately two years ago that education is what is left when everything else is forgotten. We are only passing through and must pass on the educational tradition. I reiterate that education is what is left when everything else is forgotten.",Hayes

"The Deputy believes it is alright because they are safe while in the building. People continually tell me that they are afraid to serve as jurors in any type of criminal trial in case the defendant would have any connection however tenuous with anybody involved in gangland crime. In the years following the Kieran Keane trial more than five out of every six people called for jury service in Limerick sought to be excused. There was a significant increase in the number of medical certificates submitted, particularly from women, stating that they were suffering from stress and anxiety. In answer to Deputy Rabbitte’s point, ultimately, the Keane trial was moved to the courthouse at Cloverhill, Dublin where it was possible to empanel a jury and the culprits were convicted. There was an eyewitness and they received a life sentence as the Deputy knows. While the Deputy may have spoken to people, I have taken the trouble to speak to a wide variety of people in the criminal justice system particularly in the mid-west. The opinion is now unanimous that it would be impossible to do this now, six years later, in similar circumstances. The reason is self-evident. The reach of the gang whose members were on trial in that case has expanded enormously since 2003 and they have very strong associations with a number of criminal gangs in Dublin. The gang suspected of carrying out the murder of the unfortunate woman, Baiba Saulite, is the same gang suspected of ordering the murder of Roy Collins, Kieran Keane, Brian Fitzgerald and Shane Geoghegan. Baiba Saulite’s murder occurred in Dublin, allegedly at the behest of a Dublin-based criminal who reportedly engaged this gang to carry it out. I had the experience while out canvassing with one of our local election candidates, who is a solicitor here in Dublin, of being followed around everywhere I went by a Garda car because he is under full-time protection here in Dublin from that gang. Some of these victims were friends of mine. The late Roy Collins died in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, choking in his own blood after being shot in the back at point-blank range as a result of trivial incident that occurred five years earlier. Shane Geoghegan, whose family is devastated, was mistaken for somebody else, was chased into waste ground and was shot dead as he pleaded for his life. Moreover, the word on the ground is that just before the gunman pursued Shane Geoghegan, he rang the person who had issued the orders and said he was uncertain whether they had the right man because the fellow before him had a beard. However, the response was to shoot him anyway because even if they had the wrong fellow, they could return and get the right one later. I think of Brian Fitzgerald who did nothing except to try to keep drugs out of a nightclub in Limerick lying on the ground having been wounded in the first attempt. A hired gunman then walked up and calmly shot him in the head, while [220]his hysterical wife looked on from the window and as the babies slept in the back room. These are the high profile examples and, as I noted, there are at least two dozen cases. Members should consider the case of a man called Michael McNamara who fell foul of the same gang and was lured into a trap. As a result, he fell into the hands of the gang on a piece of waste ground beside the Southill estate in Limerick and was done to death. One of my close friends happened to be working in the undertaking business in Limerick at the time and had the unfortunate job of taking care of the body. He told me he almost became physically ill when he saw the state of the body. Moreover, the medical evidence suggests it took the man eight hours to die. I mention these cases to pose a single question. Would any jury from Mizen Head to Malin Head, whose members’ identities, movements, domiciles and places of work would be known, as would be their spouses’ movements and children’s schools, be prepared to stand up, no matter what was the evidence, and convict the people behind the scenes in such cases who are capable of such vindictiveness, inhumanity and depravity? I am not confident that it would. On 10 May this year, together with Deputies O’Sullivan and O’Donnell and a number of local councillors, I marched with thousands of other Limerick citizens in support of the family of Roy Collins, whom I know personally. I am reporting the evidence of my own eyes when I solemnly state in this House of Parliament that as I marched down O’Connell Street in Limerick to the county courthouse and city hall, I personally observed a number of known individuals along the route who were taking photographs and recording video footage on their mobile telephones as the solemn march passed by. These were people I associated with certain gangland organisations. In other words, those behind the fear and intimidation were determined to make their presence felt, even as people gathered to reject such intimidation. This is a metaphor for the problem that appears to have besieged our city. The gangs are trying to intimidate people from showing publicly that they wish to bring to an end the malaise being caused by the gangs. Such is the brazenness and bravado of these gangs that they now seriously believe they have won and that they hold the entire city and region to ransom. As the gangs genuinely believe this, our duty as the democratically elected regional and national representatives of the people is crystal clear. It is to send a strong, universally recognisable and unmistakable signal that they cannot, must not and will not prevail. That is precisely what this legislation proposes and that is the reason I am proud to commend it to the House.",O'Sullivan
"I wanted to ask some questions asked by Deputy Reilly but to which he did not get answers. Is one of the difficulties we have that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and Fianna Fáil are semi-detached from responsibility for health? The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is regarded as not being one of them. They believe she is in reality but it suits them to say she is not because it allows them to claim, as a consequence, that they cannot get answers. Consider what occurred at the meeting in December. Is the Minister of State seriously repeating to the House that, having become aware of the scale of this problem, all Professor Conlon did was mention it on the edges of a meeting to the Minister for Health and Children? I find that virtually impossible to believe. Bearing in mind the point raised by Deputy Brian Hayes, I find it impossible that HIQA would not bother reporting this to the Department of Health and Children or the HSE. Is the dereliction of accountability in the health service now so advanced that something of this scale is not even worthy of being reported any more? Why was the backlog not cleared by March 2010, as committed to? When will it be cleared? Have private patients been affected in the same way as public patients? Did the matter arise because consultants were tied up dealing with their private patients? With regard to the relative caseload at St. Vincent’s and Tallaght hospitals, why is the latter so disadvantaged in terms of posts? Will this be rectified? One assumes St. Patrick’s Day will fall, as it traditionally does, on 17 March. What preparations is it necessary for the Minister to make for the St. Patrick’s Day festivities in New Zealand that she cannot be here today to deal with an issue that one suspects she knew very well was in the pipeline. There must be extensive preparations to be made in Auckland if she has to be there already. Is this not reminiscent of the famous failure by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to read his brief on nursing home charges, which ended up costing the State an additional €120 million?",Hayes
"Ministers are coming in here stating that the people can take bad news, they will put their shoulders to the wheel and they have taken €14 billion of cuts already. I do not accept the latter point, certainly not in the past two years. That needs to be corrected. It may be the case over three years, if the Government wants to go into that, but I still do not think there were such cuts. There were many cutbacks in capital projects and maybe the Government is including private capital spend in those cutbacks. On my figures, that is not the Government spend. The people of this country can accept tough news. They know we have problems and they are willing to help out but they and I have a serious issue with believing anything the Government says. Even now, with the €15 billion figure, there is a lack of data on how that was achieved. I have a fair idea because I went to the confidential briefings at the Department Finance. I can add a few figures together and I know exactly from where they got it but we are not allowed to say. The Government will not state what it will do in the budget yet it brings us all in here for a two-day debate to discuss cutbacks without the figures we need to achieve. There is no finishing line. It is like running a marathon at the weekend without knowing where it will end and running all day for fun. I will not do it, and nobody else will do it either. Let the Government give us the figure because the Minister knows what it is. Deputy Coveney is correct in stating that we must bring the deficit down below 10% of GDP next year, and I ask the Government to give us the figure now. Tell us what it is, whether it be €5. 5 billion, €6 billion, €5 billion or €4. 5 billion, and let us work to that. The people need to believe what the Government is telling them, and they do not believe the Government. It is difficult for me to believe the Government because it is still only opinion unless the Government gives us the facts to back it up. In trying to figure out how we got here, I looked at the figures for total expenditure from 2000 to 2008. For example, the health spend went from €5. 3 billion to more than €15. 3 billion in eight years, an increase of 187%. The Exchequer pay bill went up by 118%, from €8,880 million to €19,330 million. The figures go on. Those eight years of writing cheques without proper reform or proper policy are the root of the problem, and the people need to be told that. There is a need to explain what this figure of €15 billion is about. It is separate to the banking bailout, although part of it is the interest on bailing out the banks. The bulk of it is to address the wrong decisions made from 2000 to 2008 to spend money on public services built on false foundations or once-off revenues from housing, as if the Government applied for a mortgage based on overtime earnings only. It does not add up. [68]I question what was going on in Government during those eight years. Deputy Bertie Ahern needs at some stage to come in here and explain what he was doing as Taoiseach, as does Deputy Brian Cowen as the former Minister for Finance, and every other Minister who sat around the Cabinet table and watched these figures rise and rise. Nobody shouted stop. That is why we are here. When people have made their commitments, borrowed money, and got credit card and other personal debts, they will be hit with massive cutbacks over the next couple of years because of the decisions taken wrongly during those years. I question what was going on in the Department of Finance as well. I can only assume they were told to keep quiet by Ministers and Taoisigh because nobody with financial training would sit back, watch this happening and not ask, 'Hold on a minute, what is going on here?' I accept there were improvements in some services, but these should have been achieved based on sound foundations, reform of the public sector and savings, rather than by continuing to write cheques left, right and centre. The Department of Finance blames the partnership process and states many of these demands for increases in services were in the context of the social partnership process and reflected in programmes for Government. Ministers and the Government are in charge, not the social partnership process. The social partners are not in charge. They do not run the country. They were there to discuss issues, iron out difficulties, etc. They are not to be blamed for matters going wrong. On numerous occasions during my nine years in the House, I tried to introduce minor amendments to various Bills and Ministers told me that they could not accept them without going back and checking with the partnership process. That is a joke, and now the Government is trying to blame them. Those are matters that will be confined to history. The people know who is at fault here. They know it is Fianna Fáil and they will deal out that punishment. The problem is that we in this House are always left trying to close the gap and fix this, and we need the will of the people to do so. That will be difficult to achieve with Fianna Fáil still over there calling the shots because the people do not believe them. We understand we must try to work with this and we have agreed to the consensus to reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014. We accept that and we will put forward our ideas to achieve it, and we will work with that. However, the Government must understand that the people do not trust it and we will have a difficulty, even when we know we have the answers, in believing that the Government can implement them.",Ahern

"I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this new legislation, the Charities Bill 2007. I welcome and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, on his recent promotion and wish him well in his new job. I welcome this important Bill as there has been a need for many years to regulate charities. I am one of those who has been pushing this agenda. Before going into the details of the legislation it is important to commend and thank the many worthwhile charities and voluntary groups in this country. They have played and continue to play a leading part in Irish civic life. It is essential that we all put this on the record and thank the voluntary workers in charities on the ground. They are serving their country well and we commend and thank them for their efforts. [578]However, charities have a duty to be honest and straight with the public. They have to be accountable because in many cases they deal with vast amounts of money and public trust is a huge issue. It is not acceptable to have charities with huge sums of money in their accounts. This is public money collected from citizens of the State and it should be spent on the issues for which it was collected. Politicians regularly get hammered on trust and accountability, and rightly so. However, charities too have to step up to the mark. Is it acceptable that some charities have huge sums of money in their accounts or own huge valuable properties while those they are supposed to help are often left behind? I hear this regularly in my constituency. I speak as one who has been a voluntary worker for a number of charities over 20 years. I entered politics through the voluntary and community sector. I have seen situations about which I was not happy and it is up to everyone to be straight and honest with the public. That is the reason I welcome the Bill today. I ask some of our so-called rich kids to stop using charities as a cover-up to present a positive image to some of their activities. It is time for the likes of Bono and Denis O’Brien to stay in Ireland and do their work here, pay their taxes like everyone else and stop using charities to bolster their egos. If they are serious about making a contribution to Irish society, they should pay their taxes like everyone else and support our charities. Let us look at Chuck Feeney who wants no reward and donates hundreds of millions to the poorest of the poor as well as giving major donations to education institutions here. People like Chuck Feeney should be honoured by this country for his role in giving to Ireland and in the peace process. Let us have a proper honours system also for our own people. It might reduce the sad scenes of Irish citizens accepting knighthoods or MBEs from the British. Let us grow up and have our own awards and honours systems. Chuck Feeney should be first on that list. I am always saddened when Irish citizens accept honours from monarchists. All democrats should back the call for a proper honours system for people who do great things for our people, the poor, the disadvantaged and our country. The political parties should stop bickering, work together on this matter and support the introduction of a new honours system. I thank all Deputies and members of the public who donated money and sent text messages to me when I was involved in the charity, 'You’re a Star', three years ago. We helped to raise more than €80,000 which went directly to a project for children with disability. I thank and commend all my cross-party colleagues in the House who regularly donate money to worthwhile charities and causes. The public who are often cynical about politicians should be aware of this reality. Many Members make substantial donations regularly to [579]charities. I thank and commend my colleagues for their work on this issue. The purpose of the Bill is to enact a reform of the law relating to charities to ensure greater accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud. It will also enhance public trust and confidence in charities and increase transparency in the sector. The key aspects of the Bill will provide for a definition of charitable purpose for the first time in primary legislation, establish a new regulatory authority to secure compliance by charities with their legal obligations and encourage better administration of charities, establish a register of charities in which all charities operating in the State must register, provide for annual activity reports by charities to the new authority and update the law relating to fundraising, particularly in relation to collections by way of direct debits and similar non-cash methods. These key aspects of the legislation are positive and progressive developments. In regard to charities, the centre for non-profit management at Trinity College estimates that the voluntary sector generates an annual income of about €2. 5 billion, with about €500 million of that coming from fundraising. According to figures from Trinity College, approximately 60% of the income generated by charities comes from the State. There are about 700 people directly employed as fundraisers. Trust is a key issue with the public and the taxpayers. There are many cases where rip-off merchants are involved and all this will be dealt with in the legislation. That the not-for-profit sector accounted for 8% of Ireland’s GDP would not be known to many people. While big brand charities such as Oxfam, UNICEF, Goal and Concern are often most recognised by the public, many of the charities operating in Ireland are very small. According to the research conducted by Trinity College, half of all responding organisations had an income of €40,000 or less in 2003. The college’s research showed that less than 10% of organisations earned an average income of €738,205 or more in 2003, while a further 10% earned an income of €1,300 or less. It is clear there are huge as well as smaller charities. Incidentally the smaller charities make a massive contribution also. Legislation will ensure clarity on accounts. For the numerous charities in Ireland, the new Charities Bill will change the way they operate when it is passed into law. One of the key changes will be the establishment of a charity regulatory authority, a regulatory body for charitable organisations. All new charities will now be required to apply to this body to be registered as a charitable organisation. Existing charities will be given six months to register, which I welcome. The registration process will require the charity to supply [580]three years of accounts, the charity’s constitution and details of how it intends to raise funds. Section 3 defines ‘’charitable purposes’’ for the first time in primary legislation. A purpose is regarded as charitable if its aim is the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship the advancement of education the advancement of religion or any other purpose that is of benefit to the community. 'Purpose that is of benefit to the community’’ includes the advancement of community welfare, including the relief of those in need by reason of youth, age, ill-health or disability. It is very important that we support the organisations that campaign for people with disabilities. It also includes the advancement of community development, including rural or urban regeneration and the promotion of civic responsibility or voluntary work in the community. I commend all those involved in the voluntary sector and I send my best wishes to our team at the Special Olympics in China, who have done magnificent work in this area. We should all support them. It also includes the promotion of health, including the prevention or relief of sickness, disease or human suffering and the advancement of conflict resolution or reconciliation. I raised the issue of conflict resolution during my talks with the Taoiseach on my programme for government in my so-called deal. I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the €25 million allocated to the fund to assist with resolving conflicts throughout the world. Again Ireland is showing itself as a leading light in the area of conflict resolution. This is also mentioned in the legislation. 'Purpose that is of benefit to the community’’ also includes the protection of the natural environment the prevention or relief of suffering of animals the advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or sciences and the integration of those who are disadvantaged, and the promotion of their full participation in society. We have many voluntary groups in Dublin North-Central in Marino, Coolock, Artane, Beaumont, Clontarf, Raheny and Donnycarney that are doing excellent work. They are a small band of people in their own community who do magnificent work. I take this opportunity to thank those involved in voluntary groups including residents and sports groups who give of their time regularly. We all know how valuable time is. We all know there is a problem now with the idea of active citizenship and we need to give consideration to this area because of the great contribution of those people. I commend the people in Dublin North-Central on the excellent work they do in the voluntary and community sector. It is important to focus on and prioritise the disadvantaged in our society, who will always be a priority for voluntary and community groups whether they are the sick, elderly, disabled or dis[581]advantaged. It is up to the State sector to complement the voluntary groups. There are many examples in my constituency where a considerable amount of money is going into disadvantaged areas. Many Deputies want to know what is in the deal with the Government. These are all issues in the deal with the Government. I want to ensure that Deputy Terence Flanagan knows that so that he can spread the word particularly in Raheny. It is very important that we support the disadvantaged in our society. I welcome this progressive and sensible legislation that gives priority to charities. It will also ensure that the public has trust that there will be honesty and accountability in dealing with charities.",Carey
"I thank Deputy O’Sullivan for sharing her time with me. The ban on the display and advertising of tobacco products in shops came into effect on 1 July. It is a very welcome and progressive measure which, as Sinn Féin spokesperson on health and children, I fully support. It complements the workplace smoking ban which has been so successful in helping to create a healthier environment and in discouraging smoking. The impact of smoking is widely agreed to be one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity. It is estimated that across the 32 counties of Ireland 9,500 people die every year from smoking-related illnesses. This is part of a truly shocking worldwide death toll. The World Health Organisation says that tobacco causes approximately 5. 4 million deaths a year. Smoking will kill 6. 5 million people in 2015 and that number is projected to rise to 8. 3 million in 2030. Every 6. 5 seconds a current or former smoker dies and an estimated 1. 3 billion people worldwide are smokers. These are shocking statistics. It is a sad fact that smoking is increasing in the developing world and the biggest rise in deaths will occur in low and middle income countries. That is a terrible indictment of the tobacco manufacturers who push their products on children and on the poorest people in the world. The history of that industry is a record of shame beginning with the use of slaves to harvest and process tobacco and continuing today with the spread of addiction and its impact [705]on human health. The tobacco industry does not have the power and influence it once had and there is greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking. The damage smoking causes to the health of individuals also imposes a significant burden on health systems, including our own. A reduction in smoking is essential for improved public health and provision of public health services. Considering all of that and taking into account the need for constant vigilance and concerted efforts to combat smoking in the most effective ways possible it is extremely disappointing to see the Government bringing forward provisions in this Bill which water down the penalties for breaches of the law relating to the advertisement, sale, and display of tobacco products in shops. What signal does this send out when the latest survey from the Office of Tobacco Control shows that some 40% of shop retailers and 63% of licensed premises are willing to sell cigarettes to minors? While there has been some improvement in those figures since 2007 it is a very high rate and shows that breaches of the law are widespread. Such breaches help to ensure that children have ready access to cigarettes and begin an addiction that in many cases will be lifelong, injurious to health in most, and fatal in a significant number. In the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, among the penalties set out is removal from the register and consequent prohibition from the sale of tobacco products for three months for a summary offence and a year for a person convicted of an offence on indictment. This Bill proposes to dilute those penalties. The mandatory tobacco sale prohibition period for offenders is to be changed from three months and one year to a maximum of three months and one year with shorter periods possible at the discretion of the Judiciary. This is not acceptable. When the Bill was published the impression was given that this change affected only those provisions relating to the display for sale of tobacco products, the order for which came into effect on 1 July. Retailers had lobbied the Government arguing that the order would for them cause untenable loss of revenue, closure of shops and loss of jobs. The Government rightly went ahead with the order but apparently as a softener for the retailers signalled that it would reduce the penalties for breach of the law. The impression was that this related to display but my reading of the Bill indicates that it covers all breaches of the principal Act of 2002. I ask the Minister of State to clarify this matter, to which other Deputies have referred and state whether this is the case. If so, it adds insult to the injury intended by the dilution of the penalties signalled. Sinn Féin opposes sections 3 and 5 of this Bill and will act accordingly. They send out entirely the wrong signal and represent a slackening in the effort to combat smoking and the grave damage it does in our society. I have no difficulty with the other sections of the Bill, relating to duty free and specialist tobacco shops. Those are particular cases and not part of the greater concern about access that I wish to see continued and strengthened if possible.",O'Sullivan
"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. As a member of the commission, I share the same frustrations as those expressed by Deputies Tom Hayes and Pat Rabbitte on the absence of control over certain areas. There is an expectation that we should be able to make final decisions. In the spring, we produced our report on the reforms which, the commission believed, unanimously, were necessary on the remuneration of Deputies and Senators. However, we are about to enter a new year and nothing has taken place. I share that frustration. I have been in the Oireachtas for 20 years and in that time accountability has been diluted in our role as parliamentarians. We have not been able to achieve the level of accountability which should be restored to the Parliament. I listened attentively to the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche. He made some very good points. Public administration should be a partner of the Oireachtas in serving our people. However, the evolution of quangos and the removal of certain controls or the apparent removal of such controls from Ministers has almost created a conflict between public administration and the Oireachtas. Partnership with public administration should be restored to the Oireachtas. The quangos are interfering with the accountability of the Government to Parliament and it is also interfering with progress on the very many good views and contributions that Members make. Any progress initiated here is being frustrated by the current system. The discussion on the reform of the Dáil was both very necessary and interesting. I envisage our role in three ways. We should develop national policy in the interests of the people, introduce regulatory statutes to regulate certain matters and represent our constituencies. I do not believe we are developing national policy at the appropriate level. We are introducing some regulatory statutes and we may criticise the way in which this takes place, but we have a role. The way in which we represent our constituencies is also being frustrated by the operation of the House. Previously, this matter was referred to by speakers. Some people cast a slur on the fact that we come from constituencies and represent issues of concern to our people. I have no hesitation in saying I believe such work is as important as the other two areas of our work to which I referred. Sometimes I will table a question during the Adjournment debate on an issue of importance to my constituency. This is as important a part of our role as any other [1081]because the people who sent me here expect me to carry out such work and it is important to respond to the needs of those by whom one is employed. Much of the work we do in the constituency area involves responding to the expressed needs of those who sent us here and I make no excuses for so doing. Deputy Stanton referred to this as an era of communications. The Oireachtas has improved in this area but we must continue this improvement and continue to communicate with the people more effectively and efficiently. As has been stated already, the means of communication has changed completely since I first entered the House and we are beginning to respond in a small way to these demands. We have a considerable distance to go and we must continue our work effectively and efficiently with due cognisance of cost savings, but we must not ignore these matters. At stake in the long term is the survival of democracy. If we do not communicate what takes place here or if the people begin to turn against their elected representatives or the system something else will replace it, as we have seen in decades past. I refer to the nuts and bolts of the legislation. Rarely do I contribute on the Order of Business. It is a pointless exercise to ask questions on the Order of Business unless one is concerned about the progress of a Bill related to an area of personal interest. Regarding Standing Order 32, we have begun to laugh at the procedure. Regarding the Adjournment debate, occasionally I raise issues of national concern. However, a Minister of State comes to the House with four scripts and does not know what I intend to say or the points I intend to put. The question is already answered by a civil servant. It is daft.",Hayes
Please allow Deputy Ciarán Lynch without interruption.,Lynch
"I wish to share time with Deputy Morgan. I never cease to be amazed by the breadth of knowledge of the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and by his involvement in such a wide area of subject matter in the House. The fact he has come racing in to underpin the code worked out with the banks by his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, means there must be a great dearth of willingness on the Government benches to condemn Deputy Charles Flanagan’s Bill. Having begun softly by sympathising with Deputy Flanagan highlighting the plight of vulnerable debtors who, in some cases, are being subjected to heavy handed pressure, harassment and even intimidation, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, went on to deny the problem exists. He went further by saying that if the problem exists, the place to deal with it is not in the financial regulatory structure and concluded that it would not be a good idea to construct 'a vast regulatory edifice'. I did not hear anybody proposing to build such an edifice but I do not say I fail to appreciate the Government coming around to the recognition in its 12th and dying year that constructing vast edifices is not always necessarily a good thing but mar a deir an seanfhocal, 'Is fearr déanach ná ró-dhéanach', and I welcome that latter day conversion. Deputy Flanagan has raised a real issue. Sadly, this is a growth industry in the times in which we live. People find themselves indebted for whatever reason and, in some cases, they are extremely vulnerable, stressed and unable to discharge debts not because of recklessness on their part but because of the economic circumstances in which they find themselves. Only a small number of debtors plunge themselves knowingly and recklessly into these circumstances. In so far as recklessness is involved, it is not merely involved on the side of the consumer, it is frequently shared by the lender where moneys were recklessly lent in circumstances where questions might reasonably have been raised about ability to repay. Honest, decent, law abiding citizens find themselves in these circumstances and one has heard the case being made that they are being subjected to debt collection methods of which the House could not approve. Is this jurisdiction out of step with similar and neighbouring jurisdictions within the European Union? Is debt collecting regulated in other countries? My understanding is it is in many countries yet no such regulation is in place here. Anybody, notwithstanding his or her track record, background or reputation, can set up a debt collection service in Ireland. I do not mean to say someone who found himself in difficulty with the law in relatively minor circumstances should forever be disbarred from this or any other type of work. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, had remained in the House to inform us where is his Spent Convictions Bill 2007. I would like this relatively minor Bill disposed of. I am puzzled, since we dealt with Second Stage many months ago, about why it cannot be progressed to Committee Stage but we have not reverted to it and we ought to. It is an entirely different matter, however, for the House to hear allegations that somebody with a serious criminal record can engage in this business with impunity. Judging by his script, the attitude of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to be either that the problem does not exist, that it would be wrong to handle it as the Fine Gael Bill suggests or that it would be too expensive to deal with it. He seems to be saying that it is a fact of life in the circumstances in which we are living and he is afraid that we must pass over it. [871]The Minister of State came into the House to corroborate the Minister’s position and draws our attention again to the code worked out with the banks as a result of them getting €7 billion of taxpayers’ money. The Bill’s proponents may hold a different view but I do not think that the commercial banks or financial institutions are really at the heart of what is being aimed at here. I do not think mortgage institutions or the collection of mortgage debt is the type of thing that freelance collection agencies of dubious repute are concerned with. Generally speaking, a different route is taken by mortgage lenders. Most reputable mortgage lenders do not engage in heavy handed, oppressive or intimidating tactics in the way that other debts are being pursued. The Minister of State says he agrees that the financial regulatory structure is not the place to include some kind of regulator of debt collection agencies. He says the purpose of the Financial Regulator is to foster sound and solvent financial institutions, which give depositors and other consumers of financial products confidence that their deposits and investments are safe. The Minister of State is right to say that was the intention, but that is not exactly the way it has worked out. Men of means, like the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, are very worried about their few bob in the banks, and certainly very worried about the conduct of the regulator in ensuring prudential supervision of the financial institutions. The aspiration was there and now he thinks it would be imposing on the Financial Regulator to repose this responsibility with him. In so far as I can see, it is true that Deputy Charles Flanagan omitted to define debt collectors in the Bill and that would have to be put right, but it is a very minor matter. This Government seems to have made a habit of deploying all the resources available to it in order to pick holes in Private Members’ Bills. Depending on how the wind is blowing later, however, they come in with the same legislation as if it was their own. The most recent example was the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill dealing with covert surveillance. When the original Bill was published by the Labour Party there were extraordinary holes in it, according to the Government. According to the Minister, it would be in danger of alerting criminals to Garda investigative techniques. After a couple of terrible tragedies in Limerick, however, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, came around to the notion that it was his idea and he was in favour of it all along. It was then republished and rebranded. I suspect therefore that the issue raised by Deputy Flanagan about the necessity to regulate the debt collection agency system will come back to this House because we are heading into the kind of times where, unfortunately, resorting to debt collectors is likely to be more frequent. Deputy Flanagan dealt with a small percentage of people who end up in prison for non-payment of debts or being unable to discharge fines. That is a real issue, especially on a night when the Minister announced that the Thornton Hall project is not proceeding because the preferred bidder has withdrawn or because negotiations with the preferred bidder have broken down. I do not know how many times in this House I have pursued with the Minister whether he was satisfied with the capacity of the preferred bidder to deliver the Thornton Hall project. The Minister got up on his high horse, as he frequently does, and piously lectured us about the outrageous imputation that he, above any Member of this House, would be seen even on the same side of the street as a developer. It is a very odd thing for him to say, given that he was the former Taoiseach’s preferred emissary to London to find out anything he could about developers there, and a thing or two about developers in Dundalk as well, as Monarch Properties will tell one. However, the Minister thought it was a terrible imputation. I do not mind talking to developers at all. I do not see what the Minister thought was wrong with it, but clearly he did not satisfy himself about the capacity of this particular developer to deliver. After spending €41. 5 million on farm land at an unsuitable location — that was purchased for approximately five times its value at the instruction of the former Minister, Michael McDowell and then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen — we have now been plunged into a situation [872]where the project has collapsed. We need to address the issue of incarcerating people for non-violent crimes otherwise we will have a serious overcrowding problem in our prisons. Deputy Flanagan has highlighted the necessity to regulate debt collectors and protect vulnerable people from their methods, which is a real issue. One must come from a very cosseted section of society to suggest what the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, did in his script. He said he wanted to emphasise clearly that any person who feels he or she has been threatened or harassed by anyone in the context of recovery of a debt allegedly owed by him or her, should contact the Garda. I represent a constituency where debt collection by moneylenders is a pretty regular feature of life every Saturday. To some extent, as a result of the Consumer Credit Act, which I introduced, we have regulated the sector so that moneylenders operating outside the law’s remit are the exception nowadays. However, to tell people that they should advise the Garda in those circumstances misunderstands the facts of life in large tracts of urban Ireland, and I presume some tracts of rural Ireland. I can understand that out in Blackrock one may get a speedier response from les gendarmes than in certain other parts of the city. The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, may feel safe in his bed at night but unfortunately in large tracts of urban Ireland people do not feel so safe. They certainly do not feel that it is an escape from heavy-handed tactics by people seeking to recover debts to telephone the Garda and that everything will be all right. This is a real issue. I do not see any need for an elaborate edifice. Reposing it in the consumer side of the financial regulatory structure seems to be as good a place as anywhere else but, quite frankly, I do not mind where it is so long as we do something to ensure the service is regulated.",Flanagan
"I believe that the Bill before us regarding the National Asset Management Agency is the most important legalisation that will probably come before the Dáil in the next decade or decades, raising, as it does, issues not only for this generation of taxpayers but also issues for future generations. It touches on an issue of inter-generational justice. Surrounding this Bill there has been a neglect of its implications. Any detailed analysis of the Bill has been replace by a kind of myth-making in which many have participated, which [379]suggests that the NAMA legislation, as proposed by the Government, is, as has been put in some of the media, 'the only game in town'. I would like to begin by raising a few questions which are notable in the Minister’s failure to answer them or to be addressed in the Taoiseach’s speech. The first question is why a Joint Oireachtas Committee on the banking system has not been established. At one stage the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, seemed disposed to such a committee. The issues are how we came to this position, what were the decisions taken and what were the great failures of regulation. The suggestion is that we can move on without addressing them. The Oireachtas Committee should be sitting now and addressing the issue. The public want it addressed. The myth which covers for that failure is the suggestion that somehow or another, we were all guilty of an excess of spending or whatever and that this produced the financial crisis. It is very difficult to have published the basic fact that 2,000 individuals make up €77 billion of what we are dealing with in regard to toxicity. There are 150 individual borrowers who are responsible for €50 billion and Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, the heads of which have now gone, are responsible for €32 billion. A question of the first order in the public mind is why we are not investigating how this circumstance came about. The argument is that we are advance in our preparations for doing so, but perhaps the Minister or a member of Cabinet can reply and tell us when the inspectors will visit Anglo Irish Bank, return and put a report before the public on what went on there, which was scandalous by any consideration. The public are naturally interested in the fact that the top 15 borrowers in Anglo Irish Bank are responsible for €7. 5 billion, some €500 million per client. We still do not know the terms of reference given to the Garda Commissioner in regard to the possibility of fraud or inappropriate corporate behaviour. The public is entitled to know this before it accepts the Bill for the new banking system, inform the new banking culture or acquire a huge burden that will go forward to future generations. The failures in regulation are being considered by those who are largely responsible for them. There is no evidence of independent distance between the examination and the failures in regulation, which were scandalous — the only word that can be used for it. People will be searching through remote footnotes in Central Bank quarterly reports to say that they warned of this or that. It is a ridiculous but sad, pathetic exercise in bureaucracy that seeks to recover credibility where there is none to be found. In terms of the options before us, which are in the content of the Bill, one might reasonably ask what options were negotiated with the European Central Bank. Let me clear something up. The European Central Bank is simply accepting collateral from the Irish banking system, collateral which consists of Irish Government bonds. It is not involving itself directly with the Government’s failure or pathetic response to the toxicity it presided over because of its deadly political intersections. One might ask a question which is more than academic. What would happen if, instead of taking over such a large bundle of toxicity, the Government decided to address the issue of the mortgage books of the different banks? There is a tradition in this and many other European countries, such as Britain, of people paying their mortgages. It would have provided the Government with a mechanism for achieving liquidity. It would, in addition, have incurred a much lesser risk in terms of asset cover on behalf of the taxpayer and the Government would have been able to direct policy by restructuring the boards of the banks. The Government would, most powerfully — a point I will return to — have been able to head off home repossessions of people in danger of losing their homes. The Government could have achieved this through temporary nationalisation. It could have cleaned the banking boards. It could have set up an agency to handle transitions from mort[380]gages to leases to rental income and the right of return. In addition, it could have a far greater guarantee for taxpayer into the future in terms of assets generating a real income. That would have created some stress for the bond holders, however. I have not seen any evidence offered in relation to a number of other issues. It is a matter of opinion. In the short term, the public is entitled to know the terms of reference of the Garda investigation, which I have already mentioned. I would like to speak about the public interest directors, who represent another little cosmetic aspect of this proposal. Every now and again, an opinion floats in from the directors. The public interest directors will not be able to function very much unless the Companies Acts are amended in a manner that enables the Minister to define to the House what precisely he expects them to do by way of public interest. I am reminded of the trammel on worker directors that was provided for under the Companies Acts. In one company after another, worker directors were compromised by the fact that they were bound by the Companies Acts. They were unable to act in the way that many people demanded of them. In the case of the public interest directors, all that has happened so far is that someone who was once a politician became a banker overnight and described the reasonable request for the public to be given information as 'prurience'. I assure the person in question that the correct rage which is at the basis of the public’s demand to get answers to the questions I have highlighted is being guided by more than prurience. I read the speeches made by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach at the beginning of this debate. It seems to me that they seem to be relying for liquidity on a change in banking culture. If I had time to go through the Minister’s speech, I would focus on his reference to the agreement that has been reached with Bank of Ireland or AIB for this year or next year. There is nothing in the legislation to enforce liquidity. This Bill will not change the banking culture that brought us to this poisoned place into something that can serve the needs of the real economy in liquidity terms. The Taoiseach coined a new cliché when he started to talk about a banking system that is 'fit for purpose'. Clichés can last for more than a decade in economics, sadly. We wanted a system that dealt with banking rather than gambling. It is interesting how language can slip away in a manner that prevents us from engaging in a critique. When I examined AIB’s annual report, I read Mr. Dermot Gleeson’s statement that 'the turbulence experienced in the global economy and financial markets in the second half of 2008 was without precedent in our lifetimes'. I remind Mr. Gleeson that the salaries taken by him and the other non-executive directors were without precedent in any decent society. I congratulate the Minister for Finance on becoming the majority shareholder in a bank that, according to Mr. Gleeson, is well capitalised, well diversified and has a strong balance sheet. Mr. Gleeson, who was the Attorney General when I served in the Cabinet, also suggests in the annual report that AIB has millions of customers who do business on a regular basis and deliver repeatable earnings. I assure him that his former Cabinet colleagues would not have been impressed with such speculative commentary. It is like saying one thinks the piebald horse will win. The public rage has been informed by the notion that we can keep going as if nothing has happened. We are not getting the kind of analysis we want, sadly. I would have no difficulty with going in detail through the various issues that were raised in the Second Stage speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach. Many questions have not been answered. It seems that this proposal is based on a number of extraordinarily weak assumptions. Where is the evidence that the property market has bottomed out? I have the height of respect for the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is an intelligent man. In his contribution, he quoted from a limited piece of data relating to the Dublin commercial property rental market. It is important [381]to note that the market in question is being sustained by legislation that stops commercial rents from decreasing, even at a time when businesses are going out of business and jobs are being lost in the retail sector. One cannot draw general conclusions for any other sector of the rental property market from such a little sliver of data. It is interesting that everyone has accepted the myth of the month, which is that NAMA, as proposed, is the only game in town. Those who believe it is the only game are not pressing for answers to the questions I have listed, nor are they testing the assumptions on which this notion is based. It is interesting to compare Dr. Alan Ahearne’s suggestion that we may be bottoming out with what he has said in academic publications. In one publication, he described the cycle of property values as being approximately twice as long the cycle he projects when he speaks about the end of the Irish cycle. One cannot analyse historical cycles by saying they conventionally finish within a certain number of years. Dr. Ahearne must have been informed by some special evidence that has led him to change the theoretical position he previously espoused. Perhaps he has been so informed. In their speeches, the Minister and the Taoiseach referred to the investigations that have been carried out in the main banks — AIB, Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank. When I refer to the long night in September 2008 for which we are paying such a high price, I am not interested in distorting anybody’s position. I appreciate the urgency of the situation at that time, but that cannot explain the conclusion that Anglo Irish Bank had the same systemic value as AIB and Bank of Ireland. I can see how one could make the case that the disposal of the loan books of AIB and Bank of Ireland was linked to the future of the Irish economy. However, the loan patterns that were approved are indefensible. I could ask similar questions about the disposal of various assets — 36% of which are land, 28% of which are buildings and 36% of which are contractual paper — to which the Minister referred in his speech. If I remember correctly, the Minister said at one stage that we were not exposed to any derivatives, in the United States sense of that term, and their toxicity. I am not sure whether he said that last September or last week, but that is academic. I would like confirmation of what precisely is meant by the third category of commercial paper.",Lenihan

Under a long-standing arrangement, all Government Ministers and certain other office holders are provided with a State car, which is driven by a member of an Garda Síochána from a pool of Gardaí who are allocated on a full-time basis to Ministers. These Gardaí provide personal protection in addition to their driving duties. The cost of this service is funded from the Vote for an Garda Síochána.",Carey
"I am surprised at the speed with which the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, has caught up with the facility of his one-time senior Minister in the constituency to bend the truth. The facts are we opposed the blanket guarantee and Mr. Honohan is immensely critical, for a serving Governor, of the wisdom of how that guarantee was drawn, and the inaction and dereliction of duty which preceded the night of 29 September. If a Minister for Finance had descended from Mars on 29 September 2008, he may well have had no choice but to do what Deputy Brian Lenihan did if we leave out matters such as the inclusion of dated subordinated debt, which he should not have done. The Minister for Finance did not descend from Mars on 29 September that year so the question is what happened since people on the streets of this city were seeking to withdraw money from Northern Rock more than 12 months earlier. No action was taken by the Minister for Finance’s predecessor, Deputy Brian Cowen, and that put us into that position on 28 September.",Power
"The scheme will counter perverse incentives for insurers to focus on younger age groups, with insured persons less likely to face higher increases or product segmentation related to their age. Deputies also raised the issue of possible overcompensation for the VHI. The purpose of the scheme is not to compensate the VHI but to continue making health insurance affordable for older people and those with poorer health. Under the scheme individuals aged 50 years and older receive the tax relief irrespective of their insurers. The VHI has a significantly older age profile than the other two insurers. Furthermore, having regard to proportionality, the scheme has been designed so that it only partially compensates VHI. The Minister will on Committee Stage be bringing forward amendments to section 9(3) to give the Health Insurance Authority greater direction on the evaluation and analysis of the data it will be getting from the insurers and which will form the basis for the levy and credit in subsequent years. With regard to the profits announced by VHI, the figures quoted refer to the annual returns for the year ending February 2008. The more recent returns covering the ten months to the end of December 2008 show that VHI was loss making, hence the level of premium increase it had to put in place at the start of this year. Deputies raised the issue of the cost of health insurance for families, the cost of the levy for children and the position on waiting periods where higher levels of cover are taken out. Setting the levy at one third of the adult rate, or €53, recognises that the premium charged for children is significantly less than the adult price and that under the Health Insurance Acts the maximum amount that can be charged is 50% of the adult premium. The open enrolment regulations allow insurers to apply waiting periods when an insured person avails of higher levels of cover. This is a necessary protection for the insurers. Currently the waiting periods, which only apply to the additional elements of cover, are two years for a person under the age of 65 when first named under the higher contract or five years for a person of or over the age of 65 years. These waiting periods are being reviewed in the context of the preparation of the lifetime community rating regulations which will be put before the Houses for approval in the autumn. Deputies also raised the issue of the possible size of the premium increases for over 60s in the absence of the scheme. It was incorrectly asserted this could not have taken place in a community rated system. Specifically targeted multiple products that provide different levels [273]of cover above the minimum benefit for different types of conditions or higher priced products for older people and cheaper products targeting younger people lead to a fragmented market. These plans could still have been community rated in that they could have been made available in principle to all persons at the same price while in practice not being appropriate to all age groups or types of health status. This interim scheme and the longer term robust risk equalisation scheme will remove this incentive for fragmentation and support intergenerational solidarity, making the elderly, chronically ill and diabetics more attractive to the insurers who have gone after that market. Deputy Jan O’Sullivan asked why we are not bringing in the long-term scheme at this juncture. Having regard to the Deputy’s point in regard to bringing forward a revised risk equalisation scheme at this time, the Bill before us is a specific response aimed at supporting the key principles of the market. Work on a long-term risk equalisation scheme will intensify following the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. It was not feasible to amend the previous scheme in the short term as, in addition to the specific issue on which the Supreme Court ruled, a range of other issues had also been put before the courts which would have to have been considered in bringing forward any amendments to the previous scheme. I thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate. While the Bill contains two provisions which have attracted public attention, namely, the levy and credit, it is also important to bear in mind that the other key provisions in the Bill which reinforce the concept of intergenerational solidarity, community rated health insurance and the protection of older people are at the core of the health insurance system and strengthen the regulatory functions of the Health Insurance Authority on consumer protection. It is intended that Committee Stage of the Bill shall be taken on Tuesday, 9 June 2009. Question put. The Dáil divided: Tá, 59 Níl, 38.
